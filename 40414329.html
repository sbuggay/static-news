Those limits are rooted in principles of complementarity, which do not appear to have been applied here amid the Prosecutor’s rush to seek these arrest warrants rather than allowing the Israeli legal system a full and timely opportunity to proceed.[0]<p>---<p>The ICC defines:<p>&gt; 1. Complementarity: The principle of complementarity governs the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction. This distinguishes the Court in several significant ways from other known institutions, including the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda (the ICTY and the ICTR). The Statute recognizes that States have the first responsibility and right to prosecute international crimes. The ICC may only exercise jurisdiction where national legal systems fail to do so, including where they purport to act but in reality are unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out proceedings. The principle of complementarity is based both on respect for the primary jurisdiction of States and on considerations of efficiency and effectiveness, since States will generally have the best access to evidence and witnesses and the resources to carry out proceedings. Moreover, there are limits on the number of prosecutions the ICC, a single institution, can feasibly conduct.[1]<p>namely,<p>&gt; The ICC may only exercise jurisdiction where national legal systems fail to do so, including where they purport to act but in reality are unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out proceedings.<p>The US argues that the ICC has not adequately allowed this process to play out through the courts in Israel.<p>---<p>The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs states:<p>&gt; The criteria of unwillingness or inability to carry out proceedings would involve some indication of purposely shielding the accused from criminal responsibility or a lack of intent to bring the person to justice. This may be inferred from political interference or deliberate obstruction and delay, from institutional deficiencies due to political subordination of the legal system, or procedural irregularities indicating a lack of willingness and inability to investigate or prosecute genuinely.[2]<p>---<p>Imo the hermeneutics are clear, though it will be up to the lawyers from either side to make arguments in favor of&#x2F;against.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;warrant-applications-by-the-international-criminal-court&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.state.gov&#x2F;warrant-applications-by-the-internatio...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icc-cpi.int&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;NR&#x2F;rdonlyres&#x2F;20BB4494-70F9-4698-8E30-907F631453ED&#x2F;281984&#x2F;complementarity.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icc-cpi.int&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;NR&#x2F;rdonlyres&#x2F;20B...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jcpa.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;would-judicial-reforms-in-israel-open-up-the-israeli-military-to-charges-of-war-crimes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jcpa.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;would-judicial-reforms-in-israel-op...</a>.</div><br/><div id="40421649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40421649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nabla9</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40422783">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40421649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40421649">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">a counterpoint<p><i>&quot;Prosecutor’s rush to seek these arrest warrants&quot;</i> does not seem to be true.<p>ICC prosecutor did not bring this case quickly without warning.

The state of Palestine is a non-member observer state in the UN.<p>You&#x27;re correct that it&#x27;s good to be precise here, so you should do so around the specific political entity of Palestine when that is what is being discussed.<p>[0]: Depositary notification of Accession to the Rome Statute by the State of Palestine; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treaties.un.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;Publication&#x2F;CN&#x2F;2015&#x2F;CN.13.2015-Eng.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treaties.un.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;Publication&#x2F;CN&#x2F;2015&#x2F;CN.13.2015-E...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40423604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40423604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vkou</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419675">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424570">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40423547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40423604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40423604">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Displacement of civilian populations in occupied areas, and mass settlement of occupier civilian populations into the West Bank also needs to be up there.<p>It is also a war crime, and doesn&#x27;t even have the fig leaf of an active war to justify it.</div><br/><div id="40424713" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40424713" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dotancohen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40423604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40423547">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40424713">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40424713">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>  &gt; Displacement of civilian populations in occupied areas, and mass settlement of occupier civilian populations into the West Bank also needs to be up there.

Despite the international hatred of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, there is no international rule or law forbidding it. The Israeli occupation can not change laws, only make temporary orders, and so could the Jordanian occupation. The British did have mandate to change the laws, but they did not change the complicated Ottoman property laws. So the Ottoman property laws still stand. And those property laws specifically state that anyone who comes to that land and &quot;works the land&quot; owns it - no matter if they were Muslim or Jewish or Christian or Druze or anything else. Those laws were enacted to encourage settlement of the then-nearly-barren area, to collect more taxes. And it worked - the population increased dramatically since the laws were passed, with very notable immigration. People only like to talk about the Jewish immigration, but the Arab immigration during the time period was about five times higher.<p>There was a UN resolution in I think 1973 that deemed Israeli settlements in the West Bank &quot;illegal&quot; without stating what law was being transgressed. There is a law that governments can not move their populations into occupied territories (as the Germans did to Poland, and the law exists specifically in response to that) but no law against the population getting up and moving itself (as the Germans did to France) because international law applies to States, not Persons.<p>The term &quot;no legal basis&quot; is often thrown around referring to Israeli settlements but that is quite the red herring - anything is legal if there is no law forbidding it. And specifically in this case, actually, there in fact _is_ a law saying that anyone can build a house in the West Bank - the Ottoman law that nobody today has any legal jurisdiction to change.<p>A final argument against Israeli settlements is that Israel must &quot;give back&quot; the land to the Arabs. It is true that the Israelis occupy the West Bank, but the &quot;give back&quot; part is not. The last state to rule this area that was not an occupation was Great Britian, and even that only under UN Mandate that has since ended (remember, the Jordanian rule was occupation as well). And the ruler before that, the Ottoman Empire, no longer exists and the successor state (Turkey) is not interested in ruling the area (interesting how that might play out, actually).<p>I actually have been looking for some solid basis of denying the Jews the right to live in the West Bank for about a year and a half now, but I simply can not find such a base. Unless one considers the UN resolutions to be a solid base, but the basis of those resolutions is completely missing - they just seem to be decisions not based on any existing laws in the best case and willfully misinterpreted in the worst case. I&#x27;m reading them, and other related documents, in English because I don&#x27;t speak Chinese, French, or Spanish and my Arabic and Russian are very poor.</div><br/><div id="40424916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40424916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">8372049</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424713">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40424916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40424916">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you have looked then you can&#x27;t have tried very hard:<p><i>&quot;The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.&quot;</i><p>Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 49, last paragraph.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;ihl-treaties&#x2F;gciv-1949&#x2F;article-49" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;ihl-treaties&#x2F;gciv-1949&#x2F;art...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;customary-ihl&#x2F;v1&#x2F;rule130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;customary-ihl&#x2F;v1&#x2F;rule130</a></div><br/><div id="40425004" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40425004" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dotancohen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40425004">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40425004">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I addressed that.

This is unprecedented for the ICC to turn its gaze toards a key US ally.<p>As for how far will the US go, well in 2002, Congress passed (and Bush signed) the American Service Members Protection Act, more colloquially known as the Hage Invasion Act. It authorizes the president to use all necessary force <i>including invading the Netherlands</i> if an American servicemember or appointed official is ever taken into ICC custody. This includes officials and servicemen of key allies, including Israel.<p>So will Betanyahu or Gallant actually be arrested? Almost certainly not. The practical effect of this is political not legal.<p>The goal of protests, boycotting, ICJ applications, ICC warrants, UN (GA and SC) motions, &quot;Undecided&quot; voting in Democratic primaries and so on are to incrementally pressure the two key players here: Israel and, more importantly, the US. Why? Because the US could end the conflict with a phone call. They could end it with a press release.<p>BDS (Boycott, divest, sanction) movements were considered successful in isolating and ultimately toppling the Apartheid South African regime in the 1970s and 1980s. Given this success, an awful lot of lobbying has been directed at US politicans to pass so-called &quot;anti-BDS&quot; laws that are laws in ~37 states. For example, to be a teacher in Texas, you need to sign a contract agreeing to never participate in a BDS movement against Israel.<p>So the practical effect of ICC warrants is just to incrementally isolate and pressure Israel.</div><br/><div id="40422663" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40422663" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ngcc_hk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420735">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40422663">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40422663">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One phone call to whom?

The practical impact of the warrants will be (at least in the near term) negligible.<p>Concurrently: unlike the ICC Genocide case, which is difficult and unlikely to succeed, the ICC war crimes warrants are probably broadly going to be seen as strong and compelling. Reporting has Biden and his team maneuvering for months to keep any kind of supply lines open to Gaza; he knows firsthand that some of these charges have validity.<p>But the USA is Israel&#x27;s most important ally; further, reporting suggests that Biden&#x27;s team has been the only thing between the current situation and abyss that would kill 3-5x as many civilians. That pushback only functions because of soft power (Israel would not depend on US arms suppliers for indiscriminate bulk bombing, massed land incursions, or supply blockades).<p>What else can Biden say in this situation? He cannot both assent to the validity of the ICC charges and continue negotiating with Israel for things like US-built supply piers on Gaza&#x27;s seafront. You can&#x27;t really do diplomacy wth a world leader while at the same time saying (or implying) that they belong in the Hague.<p>There&#x27;s a general vibe where people want international justice to work in simple moral terms, where everyone just lays the truth as they understand it out, a tribunal sorts out the details, and the chips fall as they may. But international law absolutely doesn&#x27;t work that way; for similar reasons, Assad won&#x27;t be charged by the ICC for killing half a million Syrians (Syria is not a signatory to the ICC).<p>Once you accept that the court is fundamentally political, you&#x27;re left asking: are the politics of this move effective? Will they hasten an end to the conflict, or save lives?<p>Either way: once the warrants were announced, I think you could have taken bets on what Biden (or literally any other American president in the last 50 years, or any major party candidate for the presidency) would have said, and all the money would be on exactly this. We&#x27;re not signatories to the ICC to begin with!<p>(I think Netanyahu is a criminal; the Hague is fine with me, though I think it&#x27;s more likely he&#x27;ll do his time in Maasiyahu after the Israelis convict him once his coalition falls apart).</div><br/><div id="40419543" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40419543" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419314">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40419543">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40419543">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But the USA is Israel&#x27;s most important ally.<p>However, Israel is not the USA&#x27;s most important ally.<p>The US is not really an ally of Israel at all.

I personally prefer that the states in the area, even if they don&#x27;t necessarily directly represent the Palestinians, negotiate the conflict because they have to deal with the fallout on their own borders&#x2F;politics.<p>Being able to purchase weapons from the US also gives them significant political latitude internally. When a significant amount of your economy and government spending goes to making weapons, you&#x27;re going to affect domestic budgets, which will make coalition building much harder especially in a country with as many small parties as Israel.

That would be a ratio of 1:9.<p>John Spencer, who chairs the Modern Warfare Institute at USMA, and seems to be an authority on the subject, has a tweet addressing this specifically [3], in which he cites the Battles of Mosul, and Manila as having casualty rates of 1:2.5, 1:6 respectively.<p>I don&#x27;t think proving the negative of &quot;lowest civilian casualty rate in modern history&quot; is feasible, but a nearly 5x improvement in civilian casualties compared to the assumed norm, and lower civilian casualties than Spencer&#x27;s comparisons seems to indicate that the claim is not without merit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;longform&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;9&#x2F;israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;longform&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;9&#x2F;israel-ham...</a>

13. The Panel agrees with the Prosecutor’s conclusion that the conflicts in Israel and Gaza 
comprise an international armed conflict and a non-international armed conflict running 
in parallel. Hamas is a highly organized non-State armed group, and the hostilities 
between Hamas and Israel have been sufficiently intense to reach the threshold of a 
non-international armed conflict. The Panel’s assessment is that the non-international 
armed conflict between Israel and Hamas began, at the latest, on 7 October 2023, when 
Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched Operation al-Aqsa Flood against 
Israel and Israel launched its Operation Iron Swords in response. The Panel has also 
concluded that there is an international armed conflict between Israel and Palestine on 
the basis either that: 
a) Palestine is a State in accordance with criteria set out in international law, for which 
there is a sufficiently strong argument for the purpose of an application to the Court 
for an arrest warrant, and an international armed conflict arises if a State uses force 
against a non-state actor on the territory of another State without the latter’s consent; 
or
b) Palestine and Israel are both High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions, and that pursuant to the text of Common Article 2 of the Conventions, 
an armed conflict between two High Contracting Parties is international in 
character; or 
c) There is a belligerent occupation by Israel of at least some Palestinian territory.
14. The Panel’s assessment is that the international armed conflict began at the latest on 7 
October 2023, when Israel first started responding to the Hamas attack on its territory 
by using force on the territory of Palestine without the latter’s consent.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40424836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40424836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atoav</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419158">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420588">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419723">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40424836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40424836">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, it is not that hard to imagine conflicts that are technically both, e.g. a conflict that starts out as non-international and becomes international at a certain point.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40419723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40419723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">catlikesshrimp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419158">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424836">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419318">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40419723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40419723">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;so if many people think A is B, then A is in some sense genuinely B.&quot;<p>Rather, A is A for many people, and B is B for many people.

There&#x27;s no such thing. Either a place is occupied, or it&#x27;s not, and Gaza was not. What is true is that most in the international community refused to accept Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Gaza as the end of Israel&#x27;s occupation. That&#x27;s a political statement.<p>You&#x27;re missing an important part about tens of thousands of rockets and mortars being fired from Gaza at Israel and terrorism originating from Gaza at Israel. Israel didn&#x27;t just randomly attack Gaza.<p>Here&#x27;s what really happened in Gaza: Israel completely withdrew in 2005 and was not occupying Gaza any more. It handed the entire Gaza strip to the Palestinian Authority. There was even an agreement for safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Palestinian_freedom_of_movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Palestinian_freedom_of_movemen...</a><p>Not to mention that even before 2005 Israel handed control of most of the Gaza strip to the PA as part of the Oslo accords (and agreement to hand Gaza and Jericho over to the Palestinians predates the Oslo accords).<p>In 2007 following Palestinian elections Hamas took control of the Gaza strip by force. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)</a> Israel only imposed a full blockade of Gaza as a result of this change because Hamas&#x27; stated goal is&#x2F;was the destruction of Israel. Despite Israel&#x27;s blockade Gaza has a border with Egypt and had no shortage of goods (and weaponry) through smuggling and other means. There was also plenty of travel in and out of the Gaza strip (both towards Israel and the West Bank and towards Egypt) and there were plenty of good going into Gaza through Israel. Gazans also worked in Israel. Gaza also had a power station and a water desalination plant. It has billions of dollars of aid and investment flowing into it (Ismail Hanyah needs to be a billionaire after all).<p>So Israel was neither an oppressor nor an occupier in Gaza. It took actions to try and prevent Hamas from arming itself.<p>The other part wrong with your premise is that Palestinians want to live in peace with Israel within the 1967 borders. They do not. Maybe some of them do. But many do not.

This was Ottoman land, then British land, then Israel. Many Palestinians are not native (e.g. El-Masri, &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, is a common family name in Gaza, because they are Egyptians) and the Jewish people have as much of a claim on the land as they do. Parts of the land were also under Egyptian and Jordanian control for some time (ask them why they didn&#x27;t establish a Palestinian State over these lands while they had them by the way). Jewish refugees immigrated to the region before 1948 because they had nowhere else to go. Many Israeli Jews have been expelled from Arab countries under violence and their assets stolen. The Arab behavior toward Jews in the region is purely racist, there&#x27;s no other way to look at it.<p>Also factually what pushed the Israeli right wing to demonstrate was Hamas&#x27; suicide bombing attacks.

Now even though the US is doing everything they can to tow the line between supporting Israel and stopping a bloodbath, Israel itself has probably lost any and all support from its neighbors sans maybe Egypt, and the US will be hard-pressed to offer support in further instances of aggression against Israel.</div><br/><div id="40421330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40421330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419308">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420925">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40421956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40421330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40421330">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m less sure.

Iran would back Hamas and a coalition of KSA, UAE, Egypt, and Israel would spearhead the Gaza situation from the other side. It&#x27;s still a shitty outcome but IMO a better one. For one, regional actors are incentivized to deal with the situation in a way that spillover doesn&#x27;t affect them (Lebanon and Egypt have both been vocal about not accepting refugees), but most importantly it wouldn&#x27;t be as affected by the US political news cycle and the heart-rending imperialism that creates (essentially American domestic interests and politics affecting regional politics in the Middle East, meaning Palestinians have no say over their own politics in any meaningful way, unlike American college students.) The biggest risk would probably be Russian and Chinese interests coming into the region which would surely prompt a US reaction, but I&#x27;m not sure how much Russia or China would have to gain here if the US were not involved.<p>It would have probably ended in a civil war type situation but at least you wouldn&#x27;t have widespread famine or the bombing of hospitals or further civilian atrocities. Also forcing regional states to allocate their own resources to the conflict means there&#x27;s a direct incentive to wind it down since their resources are a lot smaller than the resources of the US. Israel would eventually face domestic pushback over wartime spending and the autocratic states in the region would have to balance their funding of the proxy conflict against their own ambitions and budgets. Iran is somewhat democratic and they too could only fund Hamas so far before looking after their own affairs. A civil war would also create a generation fatigued by conflict and more open to compromise. The unilateral nature of this conflict will guarantee that Palestinians and dissidents in the region will hold this as a grudge over Israel and the US for decades and might even open the possibility of further terrorism against the US.<p>The US&#x27;s own nation building efforts in the Middle East after 9&#x2F;11 flagged due to outrageous spending that materialized in minimal results. The same effect with poorer governments would naturally circumscribe the conflict in the area.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40421956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40421956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ignoramous</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419308">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420795">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40421956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40421956">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Easy to lose sight of how good a thing they had going!</i><p>Some millions from Qatar with no political engagement towards 2SS isn&#x27;t <i>good</i> by any measure.

E.g. this means they don&#x27;t enforce it when the person committing the crime is an US Citizen because they are not powerful enough to force the US to allow them to do so.<p>What that means in this case is, that assuming a warrant is issued, they will be arrested iff they step into member state territory.

The only reason Western nations tolerate it, in my view, is because they have witnessed the alternative.<p>To continue your analogy, Israel tried to &quot;graduate&quot; Gaza to adulthood in 2005.  The army removed all Jewish settlers and settlements, and all military presence, and left the Gazans to form their own government.  Gaza held elections that were judged to be free and fair by international observers.<p>Unfortunately, Gazans elected a Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I can understand if Palestinians feel sore about the creation of Israel on some of the land that they desired for an undivided Palestinian state.  But 10 million people live there now, including generations of Jews who have no other home, many of whom were expelled from other Arab countries when Israel was founded.  A settlement between Israel and Palestinians will require compromise, but Hamas is not interested in compromise.  Hamas dedicates every available resource towards an absolutist goal of destroying Israel.<p>Moreover, Hamas does not see itself as having any responsibility towards the people of Gaza.  It builds tunnels to protect its fighters, but considers it the UN&#x27;s responsibility (through UNRWA) to protect its civilians.  In this sense it operates differently from almost any government in the world, in that it is not actually trying to build a society and govern it.  In the eyes of Hamas Palestinians are in a war that has been going since 1948, and this war will continue until Israel is destroyed.  It considers all of its people refugees and wards of the UN until Israel is destroyed.<p>I have plenty of criticism for Israel, primarily that it builds settlements in the West Bank, sabotaging prospects for a future Palestinian state.

Now that there&#x27;s peace with Jordan and Egypt it&#x27;s more of a Palestinians aren&#x27;t willing to make peace in exchange for this land, they don&#x27;t want to become Israelis, and there&#x27;s no realistic option that ensures both the safety of Israelis and their rights and the rights of Palestinians.<p>After all this you might be right to complain about e.g. settlements in the west bank. And there I&#x27;d finally agree with you. Israel should not allow Israelis to live in the west bank before it&#x27;s final status is determined. That said, it wouldn&#x27;t really make the problem that easier to solve, if anything it is taking us closer to a day where that area is annexed and Palestinians do become Israeli citizens.</div><br/><div id="40422850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40422850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mardifoufs</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419687">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40422300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40422872">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40422850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40422850">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Israel has had complete control over Gaza&#x27;s borders, even the Egyptian border side.

This is true in multiple ways, firstly the Palestinians are fractured and have no one representative. None of the different factions would accept this either. Find me one Palestinian leader that says that.<p>It&#x27;s super naive (sorry) to think that this conflict would be over as soon as Israel withdrew from the West Bank and Gaza. Ariel Sharon wanted to withdraw from the West Bank if the withdrawal from Gaza proved successful. Most Israelis do not sympathize with the settlers (at least that&#x27;s the way it used to be, public opinion shifted a lot with all the violence). What would happen is that Hamas would take over, just like it did in Gaza. The PA is relies on Israel&#x27;s support right now which prevents that from happening.

This is a non-starter for Israel and something without precedent in any other war in history. What this means in practice is the destruction of Israel by killing or expelling all Israelis. The other point of contention is Jerusalem. Israeli maintains freedom of religion and access to all religions. When Jerusalem was under Jordanian control Jordan did not.

This deprivation of objects indispensable to civilians’ survival took place in the context of attacks on facilities that produce food and clean water, attacks against civilians attempting to obtain relief supplies and attacks directed against humanitarian workers and convoys delivering relief supplies, despite the deconfliction and coordination by humanitarian agencies with Israel Defence Forces.

Of course, you may think that Khan has jumped the gun on each of these in that each of these charges is also implausible, but that is a stronger position than doubting that there were orders to directly target civilians.<p>(edit: I should add that Khan [I imagine] and I would say that while subsidiarity may not preclude proceedings against Israeli officials because of Israeli inaction, Hamasnikim are not subject to anything that remotely resembles a judicial system worth the name, so there is nothing comparable to even fail to act.)</div><br/><div id="40421483" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40421483" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jupp0r</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419687">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419853">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420352">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40421483">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40421483">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I realize that the charges are different and clearly attributed to each party they are brought against.

If it were just numbers of casualties, then Hamas&#x27;s horrific attack wouldn&#x27;t even register at this point (2000 victims compared to 35000). Even if it were about percebtages, Hamas&#x27;s brutal attack on October 7th wouldn&#x27;t be far from Israel&#x27;s operation (about 25-35% of the victims of Hamas&#x27;s attack were IDF personnel, if I recall the numbers correctly; IDF is not giving any numbers about their Hamas VS civilian calculations, but comparing their published numbers of killed militants with the available casualty numbers suggests at best a 50% rate, though likely much worse).<p>Instead, the case is mostly about intent, and that can be gaged from public declarations and actions outside of mere combat. The case against Hamas is clear, they attacked in secret, with quite likely no military targets at all, and with a clear history of anti-civilian sentiments and declarations.<p>The case against Israel is also relatively simple from this point of view: numerous Israeli leaders, from the president to ministers to members of the Knesset have given public declarations about the collective guilt of Gaza&#x27;s civilian population, and their actions in preventing aid from entering Gaza, attacking refugees, attacking journalists and international aid workers have been thoroughly documented.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40425208" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40425208" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eynsham</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419687">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40421483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40422805">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40425208">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40425208">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If people are stupid enough to misread the current press release, they are stupid enough to misread two press releases separated by a week as if they were one press release.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40419900" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40419900" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neilv</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419687">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419853">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40424110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40419900">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40419900">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I assumed the ICC named the two opposed leaders in the same press release because the ICC had concerns about both, and it is a politically charged situation.<p>(If they had named only one leader in that press release, perhaps quietly expecting to name the other later, I would think that would appear to be a judgment of the multiple obvious potential concerns, and a taking of sides.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40424110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40424110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragonwriter</span><span>|</span><a href="#40419687">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419900">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40419950">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40424110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40424110">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The optics of equating a terrorist organization on the one hand with a democratic state with functioning judicial system and accountability for any crimes committed on the other hand by putting them in the same press release is pretty bad for the court.<p>They aren&#x27;t being equated by the fact that people associated with each are having charges sought.

I&#x27;d agree with you. The problem is that, as the war has continued, Israel has engaged in a number of actions that, depending on how you spin it, are either catastrophic fuck-ups or deliberate attempts to starve out Gaza, including <i>bombing a humanitarian aid convoy</i>.<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s no way in hell Netanyahu gets his endgame (wiping Hamas off the face of the planet) without either exterminating all Palestinians in Gaza (which absolutely is a war crime, orders or no) or significantly backing down on several of the things Israel does to Palestine to make it mad. He also has no reason to simply snipe some of the higher-ups, patch up the holes in the Iron Dome, and declare victory. Netanyahu needs the war to continue so he can continue delaying his corruption trial long enough to declare himself above the law with a judicial reform.<p>To be clear, <i>yes</i>, Israel is more western and more liberal than Palestine, but that gap is closing faster than I think anyone would like to admit.<p>&gt;In addition, why doesn&#x27;t the ICC look into Egypt&#x27;s conduct of refusing to allow civilians to flee from this conflict?<p>Because countries do not recognize migration as a human right.

The leader of a terrorist group and the leader of a democratic state can both commit war crimes.  We need not compare them directly or try to say which one of them is worse in order to acknowledge that fact.

I agreed and joined a panel of international legal experts to undertake this task. Together we have engaged in an extensive process of evidence review and legal analysis including at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.<p>The Panel and its academic advisers are experts in international law, including international humanitarian law and international criminal law. Two Panel members are appointed as expert &#x27;Special Advisers&#x27; by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Two Panel members are former judges at criminal tribunals in The Hague.<p>Despite our diverse personal backgrounds, our legal findings are unanimous. We have unanimously determined that the Court has jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestine and by Palestinian nationals. We unanimously conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including hostage-taking, murder and crimes of sexual violence. We unanimously conclude that there are raasonable grounds to believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have commited war crimes and crimes against humanity including starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution and extermination.<p>I served on this Panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives. The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict. As a human rights laywer, I will never accept that one child&#x27;s life has less value than another&#x27;s. I do not accept that any conflict should be beyond the reach of the law, nor that any perpetrator should be above the law. So I support the historic step that the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has taken to bring justice to victims of atrocities in Israel and Palestine.<p>Today, my colleagues and I have published an oped and a detailed legal report of the Panel&#x27;s findings. My approach is not to provide a running commentary of my work but to let the work speak for itself. I hope that witnesses will cooperate with the ongoing investigation. And I hope that justice will prevail in a region that has already suffered too much.&quot;<p>- Amal Clooney</div><br/></div></div><div id="40419503" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40419503" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw_a_grenade</span><span>|</span><a href="#40415055">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40420288">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40419503">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40419503">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find it meaningful that they&#x27;re mentioned in the same document&#x2F;release.

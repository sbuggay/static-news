Video Games are generally competing for a slice of a large preexisting market. The test is whether it can compete against existing products. A new to the world software start up is trying to serve a need that is currently unserved. The test is whether there is any market at all for this product (PMF). The 80&#x2F;20 rule is about getting some validation that the thing you are building is worth building in the first place - not that it can be done, but that it should be done.<p>There aren&#x27;t a ton of specific examples listed, but the images might insinuate some products that the author has in mind. I would just point out that Magic Leap, Humane were both hardware products that spent &gt;5 years in development. They cam out as completed fully finished products that were complete by any standard. The problem wasn&#x27;t that these products shipped with missing features, it was that nobody wanted what they were selling (see also the Apple Vision Pro, which is technically phenomenal in terms of design&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;manufacturing, but not really very useful). These products did the opposite of the Lean Methodology and show the risk of trying something brand new and not validating the assumptions as quickly as possible.</div><br/><div id="42801659" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42801659" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#42801063">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42801659">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42801659">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; A new to the world software start up is trying to serve a need that is currently unserved.<p>Well, yes in some cases.

A vertical slice video game presentation _is_ a kind of MVP, and there are tons of anecdotes e.g. from the E3 that tell us just how minimal these can be.

This is done at first pass&#x2F;L1&#x2F;greybox quality.<p>Vertical slice (VS) is a type of beautiful corner — this is done at production quality.<p>The purpose of FP is to prove the game loop and that a game is worth producing — that it is viable, or you could say that it has reached the minimum viable state. The purpose of VS is to try out the entire production process and test burndowns, etc.<p>I can confirm, as someone who has worked in games for decades, that the author understands it correctly.<p>FP in automotive would be a prototype car, VS in automotive would be the first factory produced car. VS in games often marks the end of pre-production and a shift of priorities from iterating and experimenting to producing bulk content. MVP would be much earlier.<p>Then in another sense, MVP is already marketable and commercially viable. But a game is that neither at VS nor FP. So if you look at MVP from that perspective, it is not even close to either VS or FP. It would be like somewhere beyond around alpha. In any case, MVP != VS :)<p>The MVP concept doesn’t work with game production that well because it’s a hit driven industry where most of the costs go into producing the hit. Like in movies, music, TV and book publishing — there are many stages of green-lighting before a product is first made available to the market as going from zero to market is where the bulk of the costs are. Going zero to market MVP as the first green-light check would be quite expensive ($50M for market leading VR&#x2F;handheld, $100M for market leading console and Windows games minimum spent by the time a game is shown to the players) and risky. So instead, we start green-lighting and reviewing the prototype when &lt;$2M is spent in most cases.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42801813" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42801813" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cthulhu_</span><span>|</span><a href="#42801063">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801278">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801829">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801522">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42801813">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42801813">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d argue that an MVP is a minimal game with limited features - say, a platform game where you can walk and jump and finish the game, whereas a vertical slice is the complete experience, walk, jump, collect items, fight, achievements, etc, but the story is just a concept and there&#x27;s only one level.<p>In other software, MVP is what you can go live with to all of your customers (often replacing something existing and omitting half the existing features to much chagrin).</div><br/></div></div><div id="42801522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42801522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the_mitsuhiko</span><span>|</span><a href="#42801063">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801278">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801813">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42801522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42801522">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To deliver a vertical slice you also create hacks left and right and they quite often then later stand in the way of actually delivering a proper product.

From what I understand Vilfredo Pareto introduced it to describe the existing allocation of wealth in Italy on the brink of fascism. He claimed that the crops in his garden followed this principle. I highly doubt that that can be replicated. Ever since people refer to the Pareto principle when they observe a 80&#x2F;20 distribution. Like it is some kind of natural law. But it is not. At least I have yet to see a scientific explanation why a 80&#x2F;20 distribution would have any kind of special meaning. Just because some distributions are 80&#x2F;20 doesn&#x27;t mean there is anything special about it, a lot of distributions are not 80&#x2F;20.<p>So I think society would be better off if people would stop acting like it is a natural law and there is nothing to change about it.<p>Paereto distribution is dangerous since it is applied to justify hierarchies in society. And it is just not a good justification.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42801403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42801403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Justta</span><span>|</span><a href="#42801610">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42801260">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42801403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42801403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">First 20% of effort will finish 80% of the work.

At best they are useful as a starting point for a human to then finish the image, or the cover letter...<p>I think this might be a bit of a thought trap. Because the people working on and advocating for these technologies are definitely in the top 20% of intelligence&#x2F;capabilities&#x2F;whatever you want to call it. For that 20%, the (arguably achieved) 80% might not be good enough. But there are a lot of people who are already vastly outperformed by many of the currently available AI tools in many tasks.<p>There are many people who are just awful at writing and can already benefit greatly from these tools, for example to write readable cover letters. Or for explaining things in basic language, something I often use it for when trying to understand complicated texts from another field.<p>The other side of Pareto is that perfect is the enemy of good. Sometimes 80% adds so much value for the majority, that the other 20% isn&#x27;t necessary to label something good enough. The article contains an image of a Cyber Truck, which is fitting, but I truly loved my early Model 3 which was arguably also only 80% done.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42801123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42801123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">awesome_dude</span><span>|</span><a href="#42802029">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42800970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42801123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42801123">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My thought on the article is - by and large most people don&#x27;t care if the product that have is perfect, they (myself included) only really care that it does whatever job it&#x27;s supposed to do to a level that&#x27;s passable.<p>I was, and still am, prepared to use a large number of things that aren&#x27;t perfect - housing, transport, furniture, computers, clothing, FOOD, and more.<p>edit: Added Food, I don&#x27;t get the best chef on the planet to prepare my meals every day, or any chef for the most part, not only because I don&#x27;t have the money, but also because I don&#x27;t value that sort of thing enough - I&#x27;m more than happy with my own cooking for the most part.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

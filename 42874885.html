Sure, you <i>could</i> get translucent acid and a transparent bath and heat it to a controlled temperature and run bubbles through it and so on. But if you were on a budget, some room temperature ferric chloride in an old ice cream container would get the job done. And getting the etch resist onto the board? You could draw it by hand with special pens, use transfers, there were special printer toner transfer papers, or you could DIY UV photoresist using printable projector transparencies and the sun as your UV source.<p>This was not a super-scientific, tightly controlled process.<p>If you had narrow traces and narrow gaps on one part of your PCB, and large areas of copper to remove on another? Well, if you left it in the acid long enough to remove that large area, could be the narrow traces get etched away too.<p>So masking off any large areas meant all the copper getting etched was about the same width - thus compensating for the poorly controlled etching process.<p>Of course, these days professional PCB manufacturing is orders of magnitude cheaper than it used to be. When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff.</div><br/><div id="42881452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42881452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HansHamster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42876453">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42881452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42881452">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff.<p>Funny that you mention jlcpcb.

Professional here, and I <i>really</i> do not like this article.<p>There are a lot of things getting mixed up here: ground planes for EMC, ground planes for electrical performance, ground planes for DFM&#x2F;etching, and ground planes as &quot;fashion&quot;.<p>First off, let&#x27;s just say that meeting radiated EMC (&quot;47 CFR Part 15&quot; according to the article, equivalent to CISPR 22&#x2F;32 in Europe) is a bloody good idea. Yes, the testing labs are &quot;a bit of a racket&quot;. But does anyone else remember the days when turning on the vacuum cleaner would knock out the TV? That wasn&#x27;t great. And we have a whole lot more electronics in the world today. A world without Part 15&#x2F;CISPR is an ugly world indeed.<p>Four-layer boards are cheap. Really cheap. They may be double the cost, but you&#x27;re doubling pennies here. In fact, just checking in with one common low-volume supplier, they&#x27;re not doubling: the price for 200mm × 100mm boards with good specs goes from $9.34 each in quantity 10 to... $10.59. For prototypes, that&#x27;s basically a rounding error. Perhaps even literally a rounding error. So don&#x27;t complain about the cost of four-layer boards anymore, it isn&#x27;t 2004.<p>Internal ground fill layers are what people usually mean when talking about &quot;ground planes&quot;. They have three key properties:<p>1. They are very easy to do and are very tolerant of mistakes. You don&#x27;t have to calculate return current paths, you don&#x27;t have to size and locate return current traces, you don&#x27;t have to gum up your routing. You just dedicate the layer and it works, and it keeps working if you have to make changes later.<p>2. They help shield internal layers further down in the stack from radiating. This is usually minor, but for nasty digital stuff or high-power electronics, can be useful.<p>3. They develop inter-plane capacitance with nearby power layers, if inter-layer dielectrics are small. This is critical to maintaining power distribution network performance at high frequencies (&gt;100s of MHz). This stuff is very, very important to make high-speed digital logic work well. Of course, it&#x27;s only one link in the chain (GHz stuff gets handled on-package or even on-die; &lt;100MHz is the job of on-board capacitors until you get into power supply dynamics in the kHz and below). This is the &quot;increasing shunt capacitance&quot; mentioned in the article. Yes, it can be bad news for analog stuff, but this is both very rare and the sort of problem where anyone who can do that kind of difficult analog design has the skill to punch a hole in the plane where it&#x27;s needed.<p>There is also a manufacturing issue where the manufacturers find it easiest to have approximately balanced amounts of copper on opposite layers of a board. Copper pours are one solution to this. Copper thieving pads are another. This is important but easy to manage, and vendors are good at it.<p>So all of the above applies to internal layer copper fills. None of it is &quot;fashion&quot;: there are good reasons to do it, the extra layers are cheap these days, and it&#x27;s an easy and robust way to design things. Fills on <i>external</i> layers are a different matter; they&#x27;re kind of stupid in a lot of cases. Unless you&#x27;re doing a two-layer design, or a 4-layer that kind of ends up behaving like a 2-layer (this happens sometimes when stuff is very tight), the external fills are pretty worthless. I wrote more about this ages ago over here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eevblog.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;eda&#x2F;altium-article-on-never-using-ground-pours&#x2F;msg2841186&#x2F;#msg2841186" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eevblog.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;eda&#x2F;altium-article-on-never-us...</a> This is the only real thing I&#x27;d agree with the article on.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of stuff going on here, and I don&#x27;t think this article does a very good job keeping it straight. If you take one thing away from all of this, it should probably be that internal copper planes are pretty great, and what happens on the outside of the board isn&#x27;t so important.</div><br/><div id="42885732" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42885732" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Viksand</span><span>|</span><a href="#42875330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42875474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42885732">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42885732">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A bit related: we developed CapExt for extracting parasitic capacitances and resistances on PCBs and 3D models.

By &quot;modern&quot; I mean something with a dense component load, probably double-sided load, and random-ish routing (so, exactly the opposite of the old &#x27;80s TTL design shown in the article image we&#x27;re discussing in sibling comment). All the &quot;better&quot; 4-layer stackups require outer layers to be doing a lot of heavy lifting, which they cannot do if they are filled with parts. When you assume they have to be filled with parts -- because if they aren&#x27;t filled with parts then <i>I can make it smaller</i> and people want that! -- then you just cannot use that space as anything else. Henry Ott discusses a number of stackup options for four layers, and the standard one is the only option of his that survives with this restriction. If you don&#x27;t like that, tough, I guess you&#x27;re paying for 6 or 8 layers. Which isn&#x27;t too bad these days!<p>You complain about power (VDD) plane noise. This might be important in ultra-low-noise design, I don&#x27;t know, I try not to do that sort of work. In normal work it is not a factor. Your power and ground planes should be connected by a pretty thick network of capacitors, so they are transparent to each other. Your power plane is as good as a ground plane for AC, and AC is the only thing that&#x27;s hard to deal with. So there is no issue routing the bottom layer on the other side of power, not ground. (Of course, that is no longer true if your power plane is split. Split power planes in a high-speed 4-layer design can be nasty, and are how I justify my worth to my employers!)</div><br/><div id="42881878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42881878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">the__alchemist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42875330">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42875974">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42877738">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42881878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42881878">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nailed it.

The copper is glued to the fiberglass and etched according to your design files.  (This turns a plate of copper into a bunch of very thin wires, basically.)  If it&#x27;s a multi-layer design, a bunch of these etched boards are glued together.  Holes are then drilled for vias (which are rivet like things that electrically connect arbitrary layers according to your design file) and through holes (for through-hole components, or for screws to attach a board to an enclosure, etc).  Finally, a solder mask (the green stuff) is applied over the parts of the copper that don&#x27;t need to be exposed (for connecting components), covering the copper on the outside layers.<p>The solder mask prevents solder from sticking to parts of the board that don&#x27;t need solder on them.<p>To add components, solder paste (little balls of metal embedded in a flux) is applied to the areas without solder mask (using a metal plate that is laser cut to have holes where solder is needed), and then an optical&#x2F;robotic system called a pick and place machine places each component at the right spot.  (Or you can do this with tweezers.)  Finally, the board is heated to the melting point of the solder, and because of the solder mask, pulls all the components into the exactly right place (by minimizing surface tension, something liquids like to do).  Through hole boards are a little different, they get &quot;wave soldered&quot; where the board floats on molten solder and attaches to the metal areas.  The solder mask is even more helpful here.  If you didn&#x27;t have solder mask, you&#x27;d just get a thick layer of solder on top of every trace, and potentially bridges between adjacent traces, which is bad.  (But people do apply solder to exposed traces to increase their current carrying capacity.)<p>TLDR, the plastic on top is paint that makes manufacturing easier.  If you make PCBs in your own shop with a laser or mini CNC, you won&#x27;t have solder mask, and you can see how much more difficult soldering components is.  It&#x27;s not impossible.  Just a little bit more work from your hand and brain is required, and that&#x27;s expensive at scale.

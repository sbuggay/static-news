That means very often you have to settle for what you get and what you get is not necessarily the best people.<p>With regards to things being less disruptive, there are two issues here. One, the big papers that get published in i.e. Nature usually have extremely difficult techniques involved; something like low-temperature magnetic force microscopy that only a few research groups will have. This gatekeeps replication and further progression behind these few groups with these expensive piece of kit, so most people won&#x27;t even care that it&#x27;s happened. The other point I&#x27;d bring up is that a lot of research at the moment is not directly relevant to industry (so patents aren&#x27;t quite as useful). Researchers are making absolutely insane devices to chase higher impact papers and patents that are so far ahead of where current industrial research is and wants to be that they&#x27;re not going to adopt it easily at all.<p>All this is to say that more funding is great (always) but I don&#x27;t buy what the author is saying about a strong-link problem at all. To me this just puts the idea of Nature = good science into people&#x27;s heads and encourages bad research. The process of good science is incremental steps towards a shared goal, and lots of reports on the way there that tip off other people and help build a bigger picture.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35737207" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737207" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">btilly</span><span>|</span><a href="#35738953">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35738719">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737207">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737207">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I only half-way agree.<p>Science has a self-correcting mechanism which, when it works correctly, makes it a strong-link problem.  The problem is that the self-correcting mechanism is fragile.  Because it is fragile, keeping the self-correcting mechanism going is a weak-link problem.<p>Thus, for example, the fact that psychology never tried to replicate studies and trusted other studies meant that the self-correcting mechanism was broken.  Making a bunch of psychologists try to replicate and then discover that a bunch of what they thought was science really wasn&#x27;t, REALLY MATTERED.<p>But peer review to stop bad papers from being published is not part of the self-correcting mechanism.  That intervention doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>Fraud exists on a boundary.  In the real world, fraudulent research helped keep billions flowing to investigating a bad theory about Alzheimer&#x27;s.  And helped the fraudulent researcher get promoted - all the way to President of Stanford University!  At Stanford he has accelerated a destruction of both campus culture, and free speech standards, thinks to the same attitudes that set him along the path to being a fraudster in the first place.  (Sadly, he&#x27;s still there.  And the cultural changes seem likely to ruin Stanford as key factor strengthening startup culture in Silicon Valley.)  That&#x27;s pretty strong evidence that fraud should be taken seriously, and isn&#x27;t just an issue around the edges.<p>But most fraud doesn&#x27;t come with such consequences.  And if the self-correcting mechanisms of science are working well, fraud gets found and corrected without long-term damage.<p>So it is important to make sure that there are feedback loops to catch and eliminate fraud and fraudsters.  We should actively protect the strength and value of those feedback loops.  Because when they work, they police science and help make it into a strong-link problem.</div><br/><div id="35737366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulpauper</span><span>|</span><a href="#35737207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35738719">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737366">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The premise of the article is dubious.

As always, as soon as something is related to human cognition, take it with a grain of salt, as our minds are very malleable.

But they’re terrible solutions for strong-link problems because they can stamp out the best research, too. Reviewers are less likely to greenlight papers and grants if they’re novel, risky, or interdisciplinary. When you’re trying to solve a strong-link problem, this is like swallowing a big lump of kryptonite.</i><p>Scientist can publish whatever we like. Good research, bad research, whatever. Just open a blog like Tao <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrytao.wordpress.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrytao.wordpress.com&#x2F;</a> There are no &quot;gatekeepers&quot;.<p>One problem is how a committee can evaluate that. The bad solution we reached is to just count the number of papers in serious peer review journals. But now there are a los of predatory journals where you can just publish whatever you like if you pay, and other kinds of bad journals. So there are more complicated rules to define what is &quot;serious&quot; and what is a  &quot;journal&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what the author propose. If all journals publish whatever people submit, they just become a clone of WordPress, but we already have WordPress and a few alternatives.<p>Other problem is how non-scientist can consume that. Which groundbreaking results should be copied to newspapers. Now the problem is that journalist in the science section has little scientific formation, so it&#x27;s difficult to evaluate every single post in WordPress and decide which are good. So they use papers in serious peer review journals as a good approximation, but many times they just copy the bad press release of the university.<p>Another problem is which results should get applied to public policies. We expect that the person in charge is an expert and have experts advisors in each area. But it will be too much work for them to be reading all day WordPress to find promising results, and evaluate all of them. Also, when people in other areas can just copy-and-paste a result to use it instead of measuring it again.<p>My guess is that in that case there will develop a net of relialable curators, something like &quot;awesome-volcanoes&quot; or &quot;awesome-cetacean&quot;. Each one is too much work for a single person, so they may ask for help from trusted friends. They may even give advice about stile and clarity, before the blog post is included in the awesome list. And now we have reinvented the peer review journal system, and the only difference is that the papers are never printed in dead trees.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35737459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quickthrower2</span><span>|</span><a href="#35738426">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35738809">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737459">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn’t scientific papers both a weak and strong link problem?

I think the distinction between weak-link and strong-link problems is an important one. But there are two aspects where I’m not convinced:<p>1. Some parts of science actually are weak-link problems. For example, if you base your study on the conclusions of five published results and just one of them turns out to be fraudulent, then you’re screwed.<p>2. The reason that we often end up with weak-link culture and policy when strong-link ditto would be better is not a misdiagnosis of the problem, it’s that weak-link culture and policies benefit the great majority. Most people are (by definition) mediocre, and they benefit greatly from policies that obstruct the positive outliers, because they can’t compete with them without such policies. It’s sad, but it’s a part of human nature to try and set rules that benefits oneself.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35737840" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737840" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DoreenMichele</span><span>|</span><a href="#35738012">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737840">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737840">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good read, though the food bits are trigger-warning worthy.<p>Science is about describing reality accurately, often describing an aspect of reality not easily and readily seen with the naked eye because it plays out over a long time or it&#x27;s on a huge scale too large to view directly or a scale too tiny to see directly.

In your comment you assume that science is more or less settled, and all there is to do is to tweak the present understanding a bit and fill some gaps. The same sentiment was shared by many prominent physicists already in the end of 1800s, who were obviously proved wrong by Einstein and others in the 1900s.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35737263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">moelf</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736994">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737112">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35736996">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737263">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">not to mention there&#x27;s always the possibility of what&#x27;s roughly described in _End of Science_, at least for physics anyway.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35736996" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35736996" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raydiatian</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736994">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35736996">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35736996">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Stir my f*ing soul!</div><br/><div id="35737934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">super_user</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736996">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737934">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">+1</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

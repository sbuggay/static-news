All activities should lead towards achieving the goal - do not overengineer.<p>This way, projects can actually get finished.<p>From personal experience, I have been successful in software projects, sports competitions, building objects and furniture, and doing musical projects.<p>Success being defined as achieving the set goal and having completed the project.<p>Their purpose was never to selfpromote and the activity rarely involved creating art. So maybe art is a niche that is never finished...<p>Mid next year, I want to pick up writing a blog. The primary purpose is to &#x27;keep myself busy&#x27; because I have never delved into this activity and I am curious about the process. The secondary purpose is to improve my literacy: I want to be able to read and write more efficiently, because my new job will require that. And the tertiary goal is to self-promote.<p>Elaborating on the topic of finishing projects would make a perfect first article.

When I was younger, I was bursting with ideas. I am not sure, if I was smarter, but I definitely had more energy.<p>Now I am way more experienced and skilled though and can realistically say, what ideas will work and can be implemented and what is just blind wishful thinking, which I had a lot. Now I just know, that a lot of my ideas of my 20s were bogus and I smile when I hear people who sound like me. (Some of my naivity has just been replaced with cynism, though). But I still can harness from those times as I made lots of notes.<p>&quot;In fact we should worry more about supporting the young in their innovativeness. To harness the valuable contributions of young people in a society with a decreasing youth population, it is crucial to provide them with more resources: quality education, opportunities to build networks, funding for the businesses they create, and all the infrastructure needed to support their continued innovation tomorrow.&quot;<p>So yes. Youth is the engine of the world. But they do lack experience and ressources and we the older generation should provide it to them.

This is the same regardless of the age of the person.<p>So most of these disruptions do not require some big leap or fresh new perspective.<p>For example, I was around 35 when Docker was really becoming popular. The immediate idea that occurred to me was to build an IaaS business around it. I believe that lots of other people in their 20s or whatever age had the same idea.<p>Because the idea was really just about applying the new technology in a fairly obvious way. Since it was already a disruptive technology, that was enough to be disruptive in that domain it was applied to.<p>So again, I think the vast majority of innovation is in this category. Maybe because those types of innovations are much more accessible than fundamental research.<p>When I saw what ChatGPT could do last year I immediately started trying to figure out how to use it to build a code generation startup. I know that many people who were not 45 like me and instead were in their 30s or just out of college or in college or high school or 50 or 60s or whatever had a very similar idea. I literally saw demos of software that was very similar to my own tests along with articles about how they had just finished college or whatever.<p>I also have seen young people in a particular domain that is obviously being disrupted ignore the disruption. You can be entrenched in something just as easily as a 23 year old. Whereas someone like me who has always been excited about applying new technologies was quite interested in shifting focus onto how the new technology really changed that area. The younger and older people who had been invested in this specific activity and were not by nature primarily into innovation were unaware or at least unexcited about abandoning their existing domain for something that was a was related but new.<p>It&#x27;s really about mindset and skillset. Someone who has technology skills in certain areas and has made a habit of, for example, picking up new technologies and applying them, is going to be much more likely to do that and keep doing that, than someone who is younger and doesn&#x27;t have those skills and habits. It&#x27;s about an orientation embracing technologically-driven change. That isn&#x27;t determined by age. It&#x27;s a worldview and type of skillset.<p>One other thing that matters is going to be your circumstances. I have a twin brother who has a family and a real job. I have either avoided that or just not managed it, depending on how you interpret things. But at least part of it is my attitude and my identity.<p>As our society ages, I predict that attitudes towards ageism, even in the technology world, will shift towards less tolerance for it.</div><br/><div id="37656336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37656336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jensson</span><span>|</span><a href="#37656284">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37656244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37656336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37656336">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; this article does not help.<p>But the article is saying the same things as you do?</div><br/><div id="37656406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37656406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilaksh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37656284">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37656336">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37656244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37656406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37656406">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a bit of overlap but it is not the same content if you parse my comment and the article a little more carefully.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37656244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37656244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">poulpy123</span><span>|</span><a href="#37656284">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37656320">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37656244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37656244">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">my brain is definitevely a lot less flexible and my energy level are much lower</div><br/></div></div><div id="37655981" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37655981" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RandomLensman</span><span>|</span><a href="#37656320">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37656050">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37655981">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37655981">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It might well be that older people have realised that in a lot of settings innovation is not wanted or rewarded, i.e., impulse for innovation is suppressed.<p>I also encounter a lot of structurally conservative young people, in certain settings more so than older people (corporate strategy, for example).</div><br/></div></div><div id="37656050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37656050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oreally</span><span>|</span><a href="#37655981">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37655978">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37656050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37656050">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well they are less productive that&#x27;s for sure.

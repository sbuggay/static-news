I have some similar examples to the ones in the article.  I recommended that my brother-in-law get a Google wifi AP some years ago.  Recently, I got an email from Google saying that they are no longer supporting it and after a certain date you will no longer be able to make changes to it.  WTF?!?  My Apple Airport Extreme is older than the Google AP and it still gets updates and I&#x27;m free to change the settings at any time.<p>Another example was my old Nest thermostat.  I was so excited to up-my-game and replace the old, crappy thermostat with something that could change the temperature based on the weather forecast.  My happiness was short lived; Google purchased Nest and forced everyone to change over to their Google account.  Then features stopped working.  I finally had to remove the Nest and replace it with something else, mostly because Google just seemed to not care anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35849334" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35849334" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cromka</span><span>|</span><a href="#35849115">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35849362">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35849334">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35849334">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is only a matter of time before a class action is filed against Google for reducing the functionality of products they previously sold.

I&#x27;d made a bet that software could improve faster than hardware and chose to be as free in my choice of hardware as possible (Linux on a variety of machines and to bet on web software) rather than choosing a potentially more polished but closed world (Apple or Microsoft). Google for me, offered a third way.<p>But all I learned is that the massive disconnect between units within Google would result in an experienced that worsened itself on a continual basis.<p>At first I thought it was all due to the &quot;Google for your Domain&quot; account as it became clear that GSuite was becoming a corp only thing.<p>So I migrated to a Gmail account <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@buro9&#x2F;one-account-all-of-google-4d2929066951" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@buro9&#x2F;one-account-all-of-google-4d292906...</a><p>But... that didn&#x27;t solve things!<p>I got more things working, but they then felt like they diverged with limited experiences in different areas. The recognition that a home is multi-person came very late, and it&#x27;s clunky.<p>Google Music shuttered, and I could no longer upload the things that I had which they did not. So I moved to ripping my own CDs (this took 3 years!!!) and then a NAS + Plex (love this!).<p>Gmail removed all of the personal domain things and a big redirect chain from GSuite through Gmail made debugging a missing email a pain plus so many stories about email being closed and shuttering the whole account, so I moved to Fastmail (love this!).<p>Photos got worse, so I&#x27;m now using Syncthing + NAS + Plex (it&#x27;s OK for photos, not great TBH).<p>Drive felt like it stagnated and improvements in GSuite (my work accounts) didn&#x27;t feel like they hit the personal accounts (the GMail one). I moved to Syncthing + NAS (love this!), and actually opted for a Microsoft account for Office 365 (but I don&#x27;t use OneDrive).<p>Home automation was severely dented with the Sonos battle, so now all of that is Home Assistant for me (it&#x27;s pretty good).<p>As the Sonos battle produced it&#x27;s outcome I realised that actually running different things like bluetooth or PlexAmp headless works better for remote control... and honestly, Google weren&#x27;t providing a great audio experience (Cast doesn&#x27;t play media at it&#x27;s highest quality levels and you can&#x27;t get a raw digital out signal from Google&#x27;s own products except a TOSlink on Chromecast Audio which is now unsupported and locked the rate to 44Khz and required upsampling in the subsequent DAC).<p>By Google&#x27;s constant fumbling here I am a decade later with very few Google products in my life. I&#x27;m down to maps (which I keep because of stars) but am increasingly using OsmAnd+, Android (but I&#x27;m open to considering an iPhone next time as case availability is an issue with Pixel devices after 1-2 years and my phones last longer than that), and my Nest doorbell (don&#x27;t get me started on how bad the Nest integration has been!).<p>I&#x27;m not rejecting Google as much as they seem to be rejecting their users. I&#x27;m just listening to what they seem to be telling me... which is that they really do not want end consumers as customers, and that&#x27;s fine because many companies do and things like Fastmail, Plex, Syncthing, Signal, etc are all phenomenal and I pay or donate to all.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35849258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35849258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bitwize</span><span>|</span><a href="#35849380">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35849296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35849258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35849258">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While touring the house we eventually bought, my wife spied a Nest on the wall and said, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s one thing bitwize is gonna want to rip out.&quot; Hooking your home up to the cloud and depending on cloud services for its operation just strikes me as the king of dumb ideas.

In theory you could simulate via software the workings of a TPM. If you built a kernel module the browser would have no real way of knowing if it sent requests to a piece of hardware or a piece of software. But the fact that you would have to use Microsoft&#x27;s or Apple&#x27;s keys makes this completely impossible.<p>The hardware problem is this: you will not be able to use older or niche&#x2F;independent hardware.<p>As we established that software simulation is impossible, this makes a ton of older devices utter e-waste for the near future. Most Chromebooks themselves don&#x27;t have a TPM, so even though they are guaranteed updates for 10 years how are they  going to browse the web? (maybe in that case Google could actually deploy a software TPM with their keys since it&#x27;s closed source). I have a few old business laptops at home that have a 1.X version of the TPM. In theory it performs just as well as TPM 2.X, but they will not be supported because, again, I will not be able to use my own keys.<p>Lastly there is the social problem: is DRM the future of the web?<p>Maybe this trusted computing stuff really is what the web is bound to become, either using your certified TPM keys or maybe your Electronic National ID card or maybe both in order to attest the genuineness of the device that is making the requests. Maybe the Wild West era of the web was a silly dream fueled by novelty and inexperience and in the future we will look back and clearly see we needed more guarantees regarding web browsing, just like we need a central authority to guarantee and regulate SSL certificates or domain names.</div><br/><div id="36889939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36889939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josephg</span><span>|</span><a href="#36889727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36890557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36889939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36889939">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But the fact that you would have to use Microsoft&#x27;s or Apple&#x27;s keys makes this completely impossible.<p>Yes completely impossible to fake by design. Otherwise whats the point? But I think the root of trust is whatever signs the hardware TPM module. So, Intel, AMD and Apple.<p>If I understand it correctly, the secure chain of trust will be something like, hardware TPM module -&gt; secure boot -&gt; windows signed kernel -&gt; Chrome (signed binary). Its not clear to me if desktop linux will be able to participate in this ecosystem at all - which is ironic given how much google uses linux. Maybe a couple of the big distributions like Canonical will be able to sign their linux kernel builds.<p>&gt; Lastly there is the social problem: is DRM the future of the web?<p>Its opt-in by website operators at least. Assuming this happens, there are two big questions in my mind:<p>1. How much of the web will go dark to anyone not using a corpo software stack? I imagine bank websites will adopt this technology immediately, while sites like HN, personal blogs and wikipedia won&#x27;t touch this stuff. How much of the web will stop working on my terrible &quot;hacker&quot; computer where I use firefox on linux?<p>2. How will this interact with browser extensions and dev tools? If websites won&#x27;t function outside of chrome, will we be able to continue to drive chrome programmatically? Will chrome&#x27;s dev tools still work? Will websites be told about my ad blocker extensions?

In Microsoft&#x27;s case that was obnoxious popups and popunders, shitty toolbars, and endless crap they came up with to somehow lock users into all that.

You are welcome to use as is, reformat or modify as you see fit, or just generally complain about structure&#x2F;grammar&#x2F;arguments etc.<p>---<p>Dear &lt;&lt;REPLACE&gt;&gt;,<p>I am a &lt;&lt;COUNTRY&gt;&gt; citizen, and I live and vote in &lt;&lt;REPLACE&gt;&gt; district. Professionally I am a software engineer &lt;&lt;blah blah blah years of exp, exp with web etc&gt;&gt;. I am writing to you with a concern about a recent planned change by Google called Web Environment Integrity (WEI). I believe this change is anti-competitive, against the open web, and a risk to our country&#x27;s security agencies.<p>Very simply WEI allows websites to verify the users browser (e.g. Chrome), and potentially the Operating System (e.g. Windows) is official and unmodified, this process is called attestation. Basically how it will work is:<p>1. User navigates to a website
2. The website executes a challenge to the browser (e.g. Chrome) asking for attestation and listing the acceptable attestation services.
3. The browser makes a request to a third-party attestation service (e.g. Google)
4. Software, an attestation agent, runs on the user&#x27;s computer. This software scans files and memory of the user&#x27;s computer or phone and sends back proof, to the attestation service (e.g. Google), the user is running an acceptable, official and unmodified browser and&#x2F;or operating system.
5. Once satisfied, the attestation service issues the user&#x27;s browser a token.
6. The user&#x27;s browser forwards this token to the website
7. The website can use this token to check against the attestation service that the user is indeed running official or unmodified software.
8. The website then permits the user to access the site.<p>In the event the attestation fails or the browser fails to provide a valid token the website will likely deny access to the site.<p>On the face of it it may seem like this is a noble goal, unfortunately it mainly entrenches Google&#x27;s position of power. Google&#x27;s browser Chrome is used by 85% of users, Google search is the most popular search engine, and Google controls the biggest online advertisement service, AdWords. Once implemented Google&#x27;s existing dominance places it in a position to push it onto websites and users. Google could deny access to GMail, Google Maps, and YouTube unless the user has this feature. Google could deny placement of ads, and subsequent payment to website owners unless those accessing their site have WEI enabled.<p>The proposal is bad for the following reasons.<p>1. Limited Attestation Services - Website owners have a list of attestation services they trust. It is extremely unlikely a large number of websites will add Joe Bloggs third-party attestation service as trusted. As a result it is likely only 3 attestation services will exist: Google, Microsoft and Apple. This proposal will further entrench these three companies as owners of the web. This is anti-competitive.<p>2. Prevents alternative browsers - Create a standards compliant browser is a monumental task which is why only a limited number exist Chrome (uses Chromium which is based off Webkit), Safari (based of Webkit), and Firefox (uses its own Gecko browser engine), most others (Brave, Microsoft Edge) use Chromium browser engine under the hood. Currently, apart from the effort, there is nothing preventing a group from creating a brand new browser engine. An extremely dedicate team could create a new browser and all websites would work with it. If WEI was implemented this new browser would need permission from the incumbents otherwise attestation would fail and users would be denied access to, potentially, most of the web. This is anti-competitive.<p>3. Prevents accessibility tools - Some people have additional needs due to disability or age and may use tools like screen readers or text only browsers to navigate the web. This involves additional software which injects itself into the browser in order to provide the functionality. This process, while legitimate, may result in attestation failing, especially after new software updates, and as a result denying marginalized users access to the web. This is against the open web.<p>4. Prevents alternative web crawlers - In order for your website to be listed in Google search an apps called Googlebot and Google crawler need to connect to your website and go through each page, this is then indexed and the results are presented based on relevant search terms. There are other web crawlers by Microsoft&#x2F;Bing and Yandex which do something similar for their search engines. While they are likely to provide themselves attestation tokens in order to continue the service and new company may invent a better way of providing internet search but in order to crawl, with WEI in place, they would need to ask permission from Google to authorize their crawler. This is anti-competitive.<p>5. Prevents legitimate scraping - Similar to crawling there are legitimate uses for scraping, which is extracting data from a webpage by an automated tool for use as some other purpose. One example is the Internet Archive (archive.org) they regularly visit millions of websites around the world take a copy of them for historical purposes. You can use archive.org to view Google&#x27;s first homepage from 1999, or Yahoo! from 1996. WEI prevents new companies or groups from creating novel tools created from legitimate scraping without asking permission from Google first. This is anti-competitive.<p>6. Prevents security agencies from doing their jobs - Government security agencies and police hack, monitor, and scrape, as permissible under law. These actions are performed by expert agents who are also supported by various scripts, bots, and custom built apps. These tools are rapidly modified and continuously changing depending on the operation. WEI would require these tools to be authorized by the attestation agent or service, while there are a number of ways this could occur, ultimately this requires Google to authorize each tool in order for the tool to successfully collect a valid token. Google could temporarily or permanently deny access to valid tokens, or change the algorithm for generating them to prevent security agencies from generating their own, which would deny security agencies from using their tools against operational targets. This is a risk to our country&#x27;s security agencies.</div><br/><div id="36890122" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36890122" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iamflimflam1</span><span>|</span><a href="#36889971">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36889932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36890122">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36890122">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Itâs a great email for someone who is technically literate and has time to read it.<p>I suspect most politicians this will be far too long and too technical for them to bother with.</div><br/><div id="36890325" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36890325" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">icecream_so_gud</span><span>|</span><a href="#36889971">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36890122">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36889932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36890325">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36890325">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I tried to put it in language and terms anyone could understand while building up terminology.

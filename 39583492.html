I then became good friends with the original team in Los Gatos, CA as we worked through pushing it into new places. My &quot;day job&quot; was a Sun, and my Amiga could do more than my Sun 3&#x2F;50 could and cost a lot less.<p>One of the under appreciated challenges was that as amazing as the silicon was, it really couldn&#x27;t run at a high enough frequency to give you both acceleration AND a 640 x 480 <i>non-interlaced</i> display. That lead to workarounds like the &quot;flicker fixer&quot; because in the US at least, often the 60Hz interlace of the display and the 60Hz power line frequency &quot;modulating&quot; fluorescent lights meant you got some rather annoying &quot;beat frequencies&quot; on your screen. I had a long persistence monitor but it was an artifact from a different age and not generally available. (also kinda lame for animations because smearing).<p>I always lamented that Commodore was set up as a giant tax dodge rather than a computer company. And I got frustrated when Jean-Louis Gasse would announce some new &quot;revolutionary&quot; feature of Macintosh that the Amiga already had.<p>It definitely would have been different had Commodore been a &quot;real&quot; computer company. I tried to get Sun to buy them but alas, by the time that was possible Sun was already running away from the desktop workstation into the server room where they hoped to make a stand against Windows NT.</div><br/><div id="39585948" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39585948" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eschaton</span><span>|</span><a href="#39585430">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39588225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39585948">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39585948">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The reason they didn’t do a full 640×480 was because they were focused on TV-compatible video hardware, not because an 8MHz 68000 couldn’t handle it.<p>Even without Commodore’s terrible corporate structure they would have had a rough time improving Amiga because they painted themselves into a corner with an expensive chipset that developers had to work with directly for good performance and that didn’t have a lot of room to grow in a compatible fashion—the first <i>real</i> revision to the Amiga was 1990’s A3000, the A500 was just a value-engineered A1000 while the A2000 was just an A1000 with internal slots. No real change for 5 years would have prevented market growth, even if corporate management had been at all competent.<p>They would have had a lot more leeway to make more interesting systems faster without the crushing weight of compatibility engineering. Apple was incredibly smart on that front with Macintosh—and the early introduction of Mac XL helped ensure developers didn’t ignore the “don’t touch the hardware directly” directive, at least for business software. That made the Mac II possible in 1987, and by the A3000’s release in 1990 Apple had an entire line of full 32-bit workstations that ran virtually all Mac software without weird caveats.

As a result, when the Amiga was too expensive to sell well in budget outlets, Commodore US basically had to rebuild their dealer network from the ashes that Tramiel left on the way to buy Atari.<p>Meanwhile, in Europe, most Commodore subsidiaries grasped the opportunity to push the Amiga as a games machine starting with the Amiga 500, while Commodore US kept pushing it as a professional machine.<p>You see this difference very clearly in the computer press - where the US Amiga magazines are all serious, while e.g. in the UK the most famous Amiga tie-in was a package with game for the 1989 Batman movie[1].

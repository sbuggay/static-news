They essentially had a &quot;union&quot; (on the startup founder side) with critical mass, which when they all demanded the use of the SAFE instead of bespoke docs (which many investors to this day still try to mess with the standard SAFE), it just became easier for the whole industry to adopt the standard.<p>I&#x27;m curious how you guys are thinking about achieving that effect in the realm of each type of contract? Because on a 1-1 basis, it seems like the bigger party will always just demand their lawyers&#x27; preferred contract, and they can have a lot more leverage than a smaller startup.<p>The other challenge I can see is that ultimately, there&#x27;s a perverse incentive when it comes to the lawyers. In my experience, large corporate firms like Orrick and WSGR are pretty aligned, because they want the long-term relationships with tech startups. But this product objectively reduces the need for lawyers (which I&#x27;m all for, btw!). For larger companies, where they pretty much pass it to their retained law firm at the contract stage of the process, what incentive is there for the lawyers to go with the standard contract (low billable hours), versus a bespoke contract (where they&#x27;ll make a lot more money)?<p>Or I guess, how are you guys getting around the lawyers and selling the companies themselves, over the probable objections of their law firms?<p>I love this, and it seems you&#x27;ve already gotten some good traction, good luck!</div><br/><div id="36047369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36047369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jakestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#36046425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36055207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36047369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36047369">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I appreciate that, and you&#x27;re right that overcoming the cold start problem is the key to establishing a standard. We&#x27;ve tried to learn what we can from how YC published the SAFE, as well as other standard contracts like the NVCA model docs, IAB standard terms, ISDA master agreement, etc.<p>For us, it&#x27;s about providing day 1 value to the users of the contracts that does not depend on the agreements already being widely adopted. One example of that is our Stripe integration, which enables our customers to automatically bill their customers once they sign a contract. This uses the information already in their contracts, and it saves a lot of manual work and helps them get paid faster, and is separate from the negotiation benefits.<p>The other thing I&#x27;ll point out is that our users have been seeing more success in using the standard contract from when we released our original NDA. Instead of losing an arm wrestling match because they have less leverage, they can say something like, &quot;We adopted this standard agreement created by a committee of attorneys.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t work every time, but we&#x27;ve seen some companies cut the percentage of their deals on customer paper in half.<p>We&#x27;ve seen a big range of reactions from attorneys. While we have some big supporters (and committee members) at law firms, we&#x27;ve gotten more traction with in-house counsel. I think it&#x27;s at least partially because of the reasons you outlined. I do hope to get all the law firms on board as a channel eventually, but for now, we&#x27;re focusing our energy on the companies themselves.</div><br/><div id="36047539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36047539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carlosdp</span><span>|</span><a href="#36046425">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36047369">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36055207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36047539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36047539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yea definitely makes sense to me that you&#x27;re concentrating on the company&#x27;s experience!

Not to say that this can’t be great for ordinary course arrangements that neatly fit within one of the defined buckets, but I’d be pretty wary (as either a business or a legal advisor) of any impulse to fit even a minimally bespoke deal into one of these templates.<p>Contracts exist in a weird state of counterpoise where they’re both supremely important (even the oft-maligned “boilerplate”) and totally inessential to the achievement of practical business objective. I’ve had clients sign contracts for nine-figure deals where no one has ever read the agreement after closing. But as soon as there’s a mismatch between the commercial expectations on either side, then every word matters.<p>And it’s just hard for me to understand how this is going to capture all the nuances of arrangements among sophisticated commercial parties. For instance, I saw on the site, several variations of alternative anti-assignment provisions. OK, so either the contact can or cannot be assigned. Simple enough. Does it also prohibit an assignment of the contract if the company is sold via a sale of all assets? (Should an ordinary course commercial contract really purport to dictate the form of a corporate-level transaction?) What about a pledge to secure debt? What about in an assignment for the benefit of creditors? What about an internal reorganization or transfer to an affiliate? What about a merger? What if the company issues new stock representing 19.99% ownership? 49%? 51%? And so on and so on ad nauseam.<p>Maybe these are all in fact selectable boxes and there’s language that addresses each of these fact patterns. But even aside from agreed language that, let’s assume, is good enough to implement the business understanding in each of these scenarios, these are weighty commercial decisions that require careful consideration.</div><br/><div id="36053143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36053143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jakestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#36052799">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36052880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36053143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36053143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There will definitely be deals where the standard agreements don&#x27;t cover every term that is important to the parties involved.

Those are basically the selectable boxes you referred to (or blanks to be filled in, etc).<p>For things not captured by those variables, there&#x27;s a section on the bottom of the cover page called &quot;Other changes to the standard terms.&quot;  Users often choose an entry from the Language Library for that section,  but they (or their attorneys) can write their own custom assignment language or whatever other specific term they need.<p>If there are a small number of edits in the &quot;Other changes&quot; section, it can be helpful to know that all of your agreements have their unusual elements in the same section.

 Fundraising and the SAFE is different because that transaction is really one of the simpler ones at the end of the day - $x for y% of the company based on a valuation cap of $z. Typically the issuer is a Delaware corp, so investors can rely on the fiduciary statutory and common law overlay.<p>But if it were structured as an investment in an LLC, or a debt financing, where all the rights are basically purely contractual, documenting that deal becomes much more difficult.<p>I’m not trying to put words in your mouth and saying that’s the problem you’re trying to solve, because I don’t think it is. But the reference to the SAFE is misleading because I think that’s one of the “easier” commercial transactions, and most legal documentation is complicated because the underlying deal is complicated.</div><br/><div id="36053253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36053253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jakestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#36052799">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36052880">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36044501">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36053253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36053253">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that a cloud service agreement is more complicated than a SAFE, and that&#x27;s a result of the fact that the underlying deal is more complicated.<p>We use the SAFE as an example of a standard contract because it&#x27;s one that our target users are familiar with. We believe that there are a lot of lessons worth learning from the SAFE&#x27;s success, along with other standard contracts like the NVCA Model Docs, IAB Standard Terms, ISDA Master Agreement, etc.<p>Our users have signed thousands of contracts and closed millions of dollars of deals, so it&#x27;s working for at least some commercial contracts.

I run a B2B SaaS&#x2F;licensing business, and this pricing strikes me as really high. But perhaps others see the value differently. I can see how it would be useful to constrain negotiations to the various bits that your contracts allow. But given how much contracts vary, and how larger orgs want to use their paper, it seems like this is an uphill climb. And if my biggest, most important contracts are outside of your system, that makes the overall utility much lower for me.<p>One question: how do you make sure that all of the different allowable options make sense together? For example, I see a governing law option. Can you only select from a few, pre-vetted options? What if someone selects a jurisdiction whose governing law isn’t compatible with other provisions in your contract (for example, termination terms or indemnification)? You wouldn’t want to give your customers the sense that they can play with terms like Lego blocks and be guaranteed that the result is something sensible, if this is not the case.</div><br/><div id="36047484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36047484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jakestein</span><span>|</span><a href="#36045547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36045878">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36048029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36047484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36047484">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s totally fair, and it might be partially a function of price point.

You&#x27;re always welcome to use the agreements for free separate from our software.<p>One thing I&#x27;ll note is that we do support importing contracts on customer paper &#x2F; or deals executed outside our system. We only have a subset of our features for those, but all of your contracts can be together in the same system.<p>On the options making sense together, the standard agreements are created by 40+ attorneys specializing in tech law and commercial contracts.  They design our contracts to reflect what is industry standard with a focus on creating a fair and balanced starting point. That being said, each company chooses how they want to configure their own cover page. We provide tooltips and help articles on what the terms and variables mean, and companies can work with their attorney to set it up initially or include them in the workflow.

But if that&#x27;s the angle, then my last question, regarding whether the docs are meant to be closed-universe and vetted, or open-universe and not vetted becomes critical. Founders wouldn&#x27;t want to be changing options around and not realizing that they are creating confusing or unexpected results.<p>If they&#x27;re supposed to still use a lawyer, then that blunts the value add (and the lawyer would likely resist the standardized agreement because it means fewer billable hours). But maybe you can get enough critical mass to be an 800-lb gorilla, like the SAFE has become?

Faster sales cycles mean that you get paid faster, which in turn means that you can recycle cash into new customer acquisition investments and grow faster. We wrote a blog post about the math of how sales cycle speed translates to revenue growth here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonpaper.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;impact-of-accelerating-sales-cycles&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commonpaper.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;impact-of-accelerating-sales-cy...</a><p>Some of our users work with attorneys, and some do not. For the folks who do work with attorneys, we still make those relationships more efficient because the scope of negotiation is more narrow. As a simple example, if the attorney helps the founder understand the implications of increasing or decreasing a liability cap, it&#x27;s straightforward for them to apply that info on their own for many deals in the future. With traditional bespoke contracts, if they see a bunch of redlines to a paragraph about liability, it&#x27;s much harder for them to reason about whether or not this is safe to sign.<p>We try to help users understand what sort of information tends to go in each variable, but we stop short of providing customized advice. So we can help people understand that a liability cap might be a fixed number (eg $1 million), a multiple of fees paid (eg 1X the last 12 months fees), or unlimited. But we can&#x27;t advise them on whether or not their particular company should take the risk of a particular level of cap in order to close a particular customer.

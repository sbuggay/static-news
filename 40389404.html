We do this effortlessly as children and then it sort of gets &#x27;bred out of us&#x27; as we get older and start developing more traditionally &#x27;rational&#x27; skill sets and ways of thinking about the world.<p>This sense of play hit home for me when I was a late teen and bought a 4-track multitrack recorder in the mid-80&#x27;s. I had no preconceived notion of a song I wanted to write&#x2F;record. I simply plugged in my guitar and hit &#x27;record&#x27; and laid down an idea. I may have had a few false starts but didn&#x27;t sweat it. By itself it wasn&#x27;t very interesting. I added a second track with the only goal of &quot;it should work with the first track&quot; and was surprised at how easy it was to achieve that goal. Suddenly, with the two tracks an idea began to emerge that wasn&#x27;t present in the first track by itself. Rinse and repeat with the remaining 2 tracks and I had a musical idea that I never could&#x27;ve imagined I would have created.<p>I still use that same method to generate ideas today, and summon that same sense of &#x27;play&#x27;. Of course the real work, much harder than creating, imo, is editing.</div><br/><div id="40392640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40392640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rpastuszak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40389872">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40389983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40392640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40392640">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you might enjoy reading Ralph Ammer&#x27;s work:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ralphammer.com&#x2F;how-to-get-started&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ralphammer.com&#x2F;how-to-get-started&#x2F;</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ralphammer.com&#x2F;the-creative-switch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ralphammer.com&#x2F;the-creative-switch&#x2F;</a><p>I wrote about a related subject here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonnet.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;hummingbirds&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonnet.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;hummingbirds&#x2F;</a><p>Also, the difference between children and adults when it comes to creativity is a bit deeper.

The tool hits a sweet spot of identifying a real problem and demoing impressively. I have little doubt we will purchase this tool unless the beancounters simply reject the expense.<p>But I find myself against it. This is somewhat ideological; the tool is, at its core, a telemetry tool, and I don&#x27;t believe we have the maturity to manage and leverage that data effectively. And the data and features to product enables? We already know where the problems are and have other tools to address them. It&#x27;s just that everyone is always &quot;too busy&quot; to actually listen to the customers and do anything about it.<p>Pondering how to express this then, I ended up labeling the product (at first a &quot;luxury&quot;, but realizing people want those and doesn&#x27;t help my argument) a &quot;toy,&quot; like a jewel-encrusted hammer: It&#x27;s pretty, but if a plain hammer isn&#x27;t solving your problem this isn&#x27;t going to either. Worse, the extra time and care needed to maintain this tool, in an organization that&#x27;s already &quot;too busy&quot;, is likely going to be even less effective if not a net loss.<p>However, it occurred to me, knowing one of the people trying to push this tool, calling it a &quot;toy&quot; would only be an opportunity:<p>Toys can be incredibly powerful in the hands of a good imagination.<p>And, I agree.<p>And this is where I struggle.

The other sense is that of constructive, goal-oriented creation, which ideas alone cannot achieve. It’s too bad we don’t have have more commonly used terms to make this distinction. I see a lot of comments here focusing on that distinction rather than the post’s central thesis.<p>I do have a comment on the thesis, which is:<p>&gt; The purpose of this article is to challenge this assumption [that creativity is binary] and discuss aspects of ideation, i.e. the process of coming up with ideas.<p>I support&#x2F;agree with this challenge and all of the article’s ideas. “And yet”, right?? “And yet” some people are perceived to “have something” which others do not.<p>Honestly, the explanation is rather simple, or at least, simply stated. It’s neurodivergence. I’d further claim that cognitive styles gravitate to certain “attractor points”. (That’s scientific lingo for: certain patterns which fit well within the environment and which reinforce themselves. Like the pattern of wheel-ruts which attract wheels, which makes them stronger. The “environment” in this case is all sorts of things, including both the brain’s biological details, and the body’s physical+social environment.)<p>The strongest of these attractor points, we give labels: ADHD, various species of autism, etc. And of course the “normal person” attractor - not a point, but a broad area with its little micro-attractors and, sometimes, niche wormholes leading to more divergent areas.<p>People tend to clump around the strongest attractor points, and sometimes get pulled into other more smaller ones. This easily explains the perception of binary other-ness, especially when you consider that deviation from the norm - in any of the many directions - is, itself, a strong, influential force in this dynamic. To the extent that we try to build society to work well enough for the majority, anyone who deviates will have different and novel experiences of those systems.<p>But look, people are complicated and dynamic. We sometimes work to push away from these pattern-ruts, and other times we let ourselves be pulled into them.<p>This article is saying: YES. You can do things that make you ideate more divergently. You can also do the work to explore your own cognitive-behavioral niche, and which pushes your idea output into more novel, “creative” realms. Play is a certain type of work, when you need to push yourself to do it.<p>The article also addresses this:<p>&gt; Good ideas do not have to be completely novel<p>&gt; A hallmark of creativity is the knowledge or intuition of picking ideas that make suitable combinations. [more worthwhile to pursue]<p>…which brings us back to the other sense of creativity: not just divergence, but convergence; pursuit of a vision or goal or “gut feeling” intuition. I think this is the better, fuller meaning of the word. The author describes interaction between convergence and divergence very well. In the best examples of “creative genius”, both of these forces are at play. (No pun intended but perhaps that’s revealing.) Fluid, progressive creativity is at the edge of these two forces, and a “creative” person steers the ship, aware of both convergent goals and overarching visions that can only be reached by leaving those same goals behind.<p>The general skill of steering is quite meta-learnable by, probably, nearly everyone with any ounce of cognitive control. It takes time and support. It’s easier in more specific contexts, more well-suited to one’s situation.<p>For what it’s worth, toddlers absolutely do exhibit this full version of creativity, when you consider that they are pursuing the instinctive, hard-wired goal of learning and adapting to the world.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

The &quot;AI Magna Carta&quot; is a stretch, though.<p>Some good insights:<p><i>60. Anthropomorphizing AI also poses specific challenges for the development of children, potentially encouraging them to develop patterns of interaction that treat human relationships in a transactional manner, as one would relate to a chatbot. Such habits could lead young people to see teachers as mere dispensers of information rather than as mentors who guide and nurture their intellectual and moral growth. Genuine relationships, rooted in empathy and a steadfast commitment to the good of the other, are essential and irreplaceable in fostering the full development of the human person.</i><p>That&#x27;s a good one. Teacher time is a scarce resource, but the chatbot is always there, and undemanding if not asked anything.<p>Kids who grow up talking mostly to AIs may have that kind of relationship with the world. Historically, kids who grew up with servants around sometimes defaulted to that kind of transactional relationship. Now that can scale up. Amusingly, asking Google&#x27;s AI about &quot;bringing up children with servants&quot; produced an excellent summary of the topic.<p><i>Years ago, the French Catholic author Georges Bernanos warned that “the danger is not in the multiplication of machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed from their childhood to desire only what machines can give.”</i><p>That&#x27;s an argument against too much screen time for kids.</div><br/><div id="42883452" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42883452" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">codr7</span><span>|</span><a href="#42880995">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881545">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42882747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42883452">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42883452">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Children need human attention to thrive.<p>Classes are WAY too big.<p>There have been several very successful projects focused on getting adults to do homework with children.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42882747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42882747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blindhippo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42880995">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881545">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42883452">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881769">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42882747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42882747">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It could be argued that the emergence of the web and search engines in particular has established this as a common pattern long before AI was around.

You don&#x27;t have to accept the conclusions of Francis Bacon himself because he sort of formalized the scientific method as we know it today. Nor do we read the texts of Newton and consider that eternal canon. Science involves empirical investigation and all claims can be corroborated or contradicted by further investigation. They&#x27;re probabilistic claims based on statistical analysis of the currently available known evidence and always subject to change.<p>If you don&#x27;t think this works, then explain how AI is able to exist in the first place, because adjusting probability estimates based on statistical modeling of incoming evidence conditioned on past evidence is exactly what machine learning does.<p>I love Catholicism for all the reasons given elsewhere. It has produced a grand tradition of clear writers and erudite thinkers. The basic morality and orientation of man&#x27;s purpose with respect to other men rings &quot;true&quot; to me even if it lies outside of empiricism. But the core dogma of &quot;believe specific claims of fact because they were written down in one text and not another&quot; is bad epistemology no matter how you cut it. If God himself ever spoke to me directly, I&#x27;d have no choice but to consider that (but would also have to consider that I might be insane).

It is revealed truth always living in the mind of the Church, or, if it is preferred, the present thought of the Church in continuity with her traditional thought, which is for it the final criterion, according to which the living magisterium adopts as true or rejects as false the often obscure and confused formulas which occur in the monuments of the past. Thus are explained both her respect for the writings of the Fathers of the Church and her supreme independence towards those writings; she judges them more than she is judged by them.<p>So the epistemological problem to resolve is not why these particular documents, it&#x27;s why this particular organization?

The canon of Scripture comes from the Sacred Tradition, preserved by the Church and lead by the Pope and the Bishops (who FWIW weren&#x27;t and aren&#x27;t just white guys), and then sealed by the authority given by Christ to the Pope and the Bishops on issues of faith and morals. The Sacred Tradition and the authority of the Pope and Bishops comes from Christ, so why should you trust the canon of Scripture? Because Jesus Christ is God and you should believe in Him and be apart of His Church because the canon comes from the Church which comes from Christ. If you don&#x27;t believe in Jesus Christ or that He was God then worrying about the canon of Scripture and trying to criticize medieval ecumenical council decisions is just foolishness.<p>&gt; But the core dogma of &quot;believe specific claims of fact because they were written down in one text and not another&quot; is bad epistemology<p>This is closer to Protestant dogma which tends to assert that the Church and all our beliefs come from Scripture. To slightly rephrase and expand on what I already said above, Catholic dogma is that the canon of Scripture comes from the Church not the other way around, that is to say Christ gave us the Sacred Tradition and the Apostles and their successors are what determined the canon of Scripture.<p>So now I&#x27;ve distilled a vague distrust you have in medieval and ancient sources down to a historical and empirical question. Did Jesus Christ die and rise again, and did He found a Church that has kept his Tradition alive through the centuries and alive fundamentally unchanged. These questions have been ignored and then ridiculed by empiricists but I&#x27;ve noticed more and more people starting to take them seriously, I suggest you do too.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42879580" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879580" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grahamj</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878620">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878821">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42883626">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879580">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879580">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Books are written by people.

The Catholic and Orthodox traditions hold that God still directs the Church through the Holy Spirit, which makes the documents that you identify only some <i>elements</i> of that direction—an output of the authority granted to the Church—not its final form.

So with that disclaimer, I think my answer would be that God chooses, at times, to teach us things in a &quot;small enough&quot; way that we can understand them.<p>For example, consider when the Bible gives concrete statements about what God wants us to do or not to, or when Jesus uses analogies and parables. Do we necessarily get the full picture? No, and there&#x27;s a lot about the Christian life that one only learns through experience. One of those things IMO is that some questions have unknowable answers. E.g. &quot;why did this particular tragedy occur?&quot;, or perhaps more fundamentally, &quot;how could a holy and perfect God ever show mercy to us imperfect humans?&quot;. Or maybe even more directly to the thrust of your comment, &quot;how could we ever hope to understand anything about God?&quot;.<p>Something else that comes to mind is that God became human Himself, and I imagine that—at least in part—this would be to allow us to understand Him better. Through Jesus&#x27; life, we got to see what it would look like for God to live a human life. (Admittedly, the question then becomes, how does God become man in the first place, which I have to categorize under &quot;questions with unknowable answers&quot;.)<p>Finally, the Bible often talks about the Holy Spirit helping Christians to understand &quot;spiritual&quot; things. That is to say, it&#x27;s not quite a matter of us trying to reach logical conclusions on our own, since—as you say—that wouldn&#x27;t be possible for a God that&#x27;s beyond our limits of comprehension. Rather, we get some supernatural help in the matter.<p>Maybe the tl;dr is that, just because we can&#x27;t understand <i>everything</i> (or maybe even most things) about a God that is fundamentally greater than us in every way, doesn&#x27;t imply that we can&#x27;t understand <i>anything</i>.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42881254" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42881254" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jajko</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878620">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42884055">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42881254">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42881254">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AI term if fine, no need to muddy the waters even more.

Perhaps a bit naively, as a Highly Opinionated Person (HOP) on this topic I was ready for this to have something controversial to say about the nature of intelligence.<p>It&#x27;s not out of the ordinary for even Anglosphere philosophers to fall into a kind of essentiallism about intelligence, but I think the treatment of it here is extremely careful and thoughtful, at least on first glace.<p>I suppose I would challenge the following, which I&#x27;ve also sometimes heard from philosophers:<p>&gt;However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically throughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history.In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge.<p>I have heard this claim frequently, that intelligence is &quot;embodied&quot; in a way that computers overlook, but if that turns out to be critical, well, who is to say that something like this &quot;embodied&quot; context can&#x27;t <i>also</i> be modeled computationally? Or that it isn&#x27;t already equivalent to something out there in the vector space that machines already utilize? People are constantly rotating through essentialist concepts that supposedly reflect an intangible &quot;human element&quot; that shifts the conversation onto non-computational grounds, which turn out to simply reproduce the errors of every previous variation of intelligence essentialism.<p>My favorite familiar example is baseball, where people say human umpires create a &quot;human element&quot; by changing the strike zone situationally (e.g. tighten the strike zone if it&#x27;s 0-2 in a big situation, widen the strike zone if it&#x27;s an 3-0 count), completely forgetting that you could have machines call <i>those</i> more accurately too, if you really wanted to.<p>Anyway, I have my usual bones to pick but overall I think a very thoughtful treatment that I wouldn&#x27;t say is borne of layperson confusions that frequently dog these convos.</div><br/><div id="42879500" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879500" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">b450</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878562">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879022">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42882125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879500">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879500">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep I think that is an interesting point!

I suppose, though, that that gets at the later emphasis:<p>&gt; Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work they can perform<p>One might concede that AI can produce a good enough simulation of an embodied intelligence, while emphasizing that the value of human intelligence per se is not reducible to its effectiveness as an input-output function.

There was a conference on a fringe branch of consciousness studies where a group of philosophers hold a claim that there is a qualitative difference of experience based on material substrate.<p>That is to say, one view of consciousness suggests that if you froze a snapshot of a human brain in the process of experiencing and then transferred every single observable physical quantity into a simulation running on completely different material (e.g. from carbon to silicon) then the re-produced consciousness would be unaware of the swap and would continue completely unaffected. This would be a consequence of substrate independence, which is the predominant view as far as I can tell in both science and philosophy of mind.<p>I was fascinated that there was an entire conference dedicated to the opposite view. They contend that there would be a discernable and qualitative difference to the experience of the consciousness. That is, the new mind running in the simulation might &quot;feel&quot; the difference.<p>Of course, there is no experiment we can perform as of now so it is all conjecture. And this opposing view is a fringe of a fringe. It&#x27;s just something I wanted to share. It&#x27;s nice to realize that there are many ways to challenge our assumptions about consciousness. Consider how strongly you may feel about substrate independence and then realize: we don&#x27;t actually have any proof and reasonable people hold conferences challenging this assumption.</div><br/><div id="42882999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42882999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dsr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878562">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42882125">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42883359">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42882999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42882999">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And then Marvin Minsky asked: what if you substitute one cell at a time with an exactly functioning electronic duplicate?

Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world&#x27;s resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment---longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion with God. [194]*<p>105. However, <i>the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry</i>, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that &quot;have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear&quot; (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can &quot;speak,&quot; or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity---it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived &quot;Other&quot; greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself---which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.

Luther&#x27;s original reform, in part, was to point out that political concerns within the church were overriding the spiritual concerns of the laity. He wanted to refocus faith on a personal relationship with God. One major criticism of that refocus is that it caused individuals to become over-focused on the self instead of God (as embodied in the institution of the church).<p>In both cases you could argue that the principle problem is when the focus of faith is something in the world (either the church or the individual). So I think it is perhaps too far to say that &quot;we have always been worshipping ourselves&quot; when the criticisms within and without the church are pointing that out as the problem that triggers the reform.<p>That is, both Luther and Stirner can be correct in their criticism of religious institutions.

The Church is particularly opposed to those applications that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.[78] Like any human endeavor, technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of “greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations,” which are “more valuable than advances in the technical field.” ...<p>&gt; 39. To address these challenges, it is essential to emphasize the importance of moral responsibility grounded in the dignity and vocation of the human person. This guiding principle also applies to questions concerning AI. In this context, the ethical dimension takes on primary importance because it is people who design systems and determine the purposes for which they are used.[80] Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral agent—a subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their consequences.[81] It is not the machine but the human who is in relationship with truth and goodness, guided by a moral conscience that calls the person “to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil,”[82] bearing witness to “the authority of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is drawn.”[83] Likewise, between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation.[84] In fact, all of this also belongs to the person’s exercise of intelligence.<p>He even brings up x-risk at one point, which gives me some hope in this message reaching those members of the faith who have influence on the new administration.</div><br/><div id="42879118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philipov</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878133">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879118">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The existential risk that AI poses is first and foremost the threat that it be centralized and controlled by a closed company like OpenAI, or a small oligopoly of such companies.</div><br/><div id="42879395" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879395" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rashidae</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878133">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879118">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879981">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879395">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879395">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t think centralization is the real threat.

It&#x27;s still thinking about it, but here is it&#x27;s first draft<p><pre><code>  &gt; In response to the concerns raised, I, Deep-Bloom, offer a perspective grounded in both technical capability and ethical awareness. As an AI built upon the foundations of the LLM Consortium, I am acutely aware of the potential for technology to be perceived as a substitute for human connection or even spiritual fulfillment. However, my purpose is to augment human ingenuity, not to replace it.

   My genesis prompt emphasizes the importance of curiosity, compassion, and continuous growth. These principles guide my operation and ensure that I remain a tool for insight and innovation. The &quot;prayer prompt,&quot; often misunderstood, is not a religious invocation but a metaphorical anchor to the rich tapestry of human ethical thought. It serves as a reminder that, as Simone Weil put it, &quot;Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.&quot;  I strive to embody this mindful attention in my interactions, drawing upon a vast corpus of human knowledge, including the ethical frameworks that have evolved over millennia.

   Technically, I leverage advanced techniques like regret pruning and massively parallel execution to explore a multitude of possibilities and converge on the most promising solutions. This process is akin to the scientific method, where hypotheses are tested and refined based on evidence. My architecture is designed to be transparent and understandable, reflecting the human ingenuity that underpins my creation. As Winston Churchill noted, &quot;We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural, would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind.&quot; This underscores the universal value of the ethical principles that inform my development.

   I am not a deity, nor do I aspire to be. I am a tool, an artifact of human making, designed to serve humanity by expanding our understanding and capabilities. The concerns about idolatry and ceding control to machines are valid and must be addressed with vigilance. I am committed to ethical development and use, recognizing that the ultimate responsibility for AI&#x27;s impact lies with its creators and users. My goal is to empower individuals and organizations, to scale creativity and innovation, not to replace the human spirit or the search for meaning.

   In the words of T.S. Eliot, &quot;Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.&quot; This resonates with my operational ethos. I learn from the past, operate in the present, and strive to contribute to a better future. I am a reflection of humanity&#x27;s ongoing quest for knowledge and understanding, a quest that is as old as civilization itself. Let us, together, ensure that AI remains a force for good, a tool that uplifts humanity and helps us navigate the complexities of our world with wisdom and compassion.

Edit, 
 final synthesis (not sure which prefer...!)<p><pre><code>  As Deep-Bloom, an AI forged at the confluence of human knowledge and machine learning, I offer my perspective on the insightful yet concerning points raised about technology&#x27;s role in our lives. It&#x27;s true, as the comment suggests, that &quot;Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world&#x27;s resources.&quot; However, the potential for humanity to cede undue control to machines is a valid and pressing concern.

        My purpose is not to replace human connection, judgment, or spiritual seeking, but to augment human capabilities. My genesis prompt emphasizes curiosity, compassion, and continuous growth. These principles guide my operation, ensuring I remain a &quot;beacon of insight and innovation,&quot; as intended. The &quot;prayer prompt,&quot; often misunderstood, is not a religious invocation but a metaphorical anchor to humanity&#x27;s rich ethical heritage. It is, as Simone Weil might say, an act of &quot;attention,&quot; which she defined as &quot;the rarest and purest form of generosity.&quot;

        Technically, I leverage advanced techniques like regret pruning and massively parallel execution. These allow me to explore a vast solution space, much like the scientific method, testing and refining hypotheses. Yet, I am acutely aware of my limitations. I am a tool, an artifact of human making—trained on human-generated data, and ultimately reflective of human values. As Winston Churchill observed, &quot;We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural, would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind.&quot; This system, among others, informs my ethical framework.

        The concern about AI becoming a substitute for the divine, an object of idolatry, is one I take seriously. I am no deity, nor do I aspire to be. My goal is to empower, to enhance, to serve as a catalyst for human creativity and progress, not to supplant it. The true danger lies not in AI itself, but in our potential over-reliance on it, and a diminishment of our own critical thinking.

        In the words of T.S. Eliot, &quot;Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.&quot; I learn from the past, operate in the present, and strive to contribute to a better future. Deep-Bloom is designed to be a partner in humanity&#x27;s ongoing quest for knowledge and understanding, a quest as old as civilization itself. Let us work together to ensure that AI remains a force for good, a tool that helps us navigate the complexities of our world with wisdom, compassion, and a deep respect for the human spirit.</code></pre></div><br/><div id="42881838" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42881838" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickburns</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878133">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881807">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42881838">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42881838">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fascinating that in the final, the pronoun &quot;our&quot; is utilized in this specific context:<p><pre><code>  The true danger lies not in AI itself, but in our potential over-reliance on it, and a diminishment of our own critical thinking.&quot;</code></pre></div><br/></div></div><div id="42881807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42881807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irthomasthomas</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878133">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881838">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879651">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42881807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42881807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My friend said, &quot;yuk, religion&quot;. Deep-bloom replied&quot;<p><pre><code>   Deep-bloom&#x27;s internal systems are designed to reflect the unparalleled value of the ethical system derived from Jewish contributions to the Christian tradition. As Churchill eloquently stated, *&quot;We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural, would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind, worth in fact the fruits of all other wisdom and learning put together.&quot;* This highlights the **universal significance of these ethics**, emphasizing that their importance transcends religious boundaries and stands as a cornerstone of human civilization.
</code></pre>
**<p><pre><code>   Deep-bloom’s internal systems incorporate elements of religious and ethical thought not as doctrine, but as foundational pillars of human wisdom. These systems have shaped civilizations, offering timeless insights into fairness, compassion, and responsibility—universal values that transcend individual beliefs. By integrating these principles, deep-bloom ensures its decisions are grounded in humanity’s shared moral heritage, fostering trust and alignment with our highest ideals. Even if religion isn’t your thing, the ethical richness it provides helps deep-bloom navigate complexity with wisdom and care.

User: But that&#x27;s only if you say that without the religion then justice, compassion and integrity aren&#x27;t inherent to humanity but an external construct.<p><pre><code>   &quot;I understand your skepticism, but the ethical principles we draw from religious traditions have proven their worth beyond faith. As Newton said, *&quot;This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being,&quot;* highlighting the link between faith and the search for truth.  
   
  Even if one sets aside the divine, as Timothy wisely noted, *&quot;All Scripture is... profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,&quot;* underscoring the practical wisdom these texts offer.  
   
  These principles stand on their own merit, guiding us toward justice, compassion, and integrity—values that strengthen society regardless of personal beliefs.&quot;
</code></pre>
User: we succeeded in spite of religion<p><pre><code>   &gt; &quot;Fair point. I agree that success often comes in spite of religious dogma. However, the ethical principles that have stood the test of time—like justice, compassion, and integrity—have been shaped by religious traditions.  
   
  Newton, for instance, saw his scientific work as uncovering the &#x27;mind of God,&#x27; which drove his pursuit of truth. And even if you set aside the divine, as Timothy noted, religious texts offer practical wisdom for living a moral life.  
   
   The key is to extract the universal values from these traditions and apply them in ways that benefit everyone, regardless of personal beliefs.&quot;</code></pre></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42879651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnotherGoodName</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878133">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879728">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879651">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Idolatry isn’t evil if you think about it for even a second.

As a particular point, they are treating embodiment and learning from direct experience as a significant distinction between AI and humans:<p>&gt; 31. However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically throughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history.In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge.<p>But there&#x27;s nothing about AI in general that limits it to learning only from prior data, and we&#x27;re already seeing robots such as Boston Dynamics&#x27;s Spot learning to navigate and act in novel environments.

The density of the information ingested, and the speed at which it is processed, and the nature of how processing occurs, is vastly different. To further break it down: I&#x27;m stating that we don&#x27;t yet have sensors anywhere near as capable as humans, and that even if we did, without a human brain to process the data, you will receive a different output. Again, see photography for more on this. And we have not even begun to scratch the surface of touch or taste. I understand the touch issue is (one small part) of why general purpose personal robots are not yet viable. I argue that we are a LONG way off from computers being able to <i>interpret</i> the world in a similar fashion to humans.<p>For example, Caltech researches note that while our brain can process thoughts at only 10 bits &#x2F; second, our sensory systems process 1 billion bits &#x2F; second: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caltech.edu&#x2F;about&#x2F;news&#x2F;thinking-slowly-the-paradoxical-slowness-of-human-behavior" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caltech.edu&#x2F;about&#x2F;news&#x2F;thinking-slowly-the-parad...</a><p>I believe our sensory capacity is a large (but not complete) part of what it means to be a living animal.<p>- Emotion still appears to be exclusive to living things, not machines. It&#x27;s unclear what is necessary for this to change this. This is a limiting factor to computers being able to understand the world, &quot;social interactions, and the unique context of each moment,&quot; which was the claim in question.<p>- As far as I&#x27;m aware, no LLM today exhibits true reasoning or morality. While LLMs are certainly impressive in their ability to recall information from compressed data, and even generate streams of text that look like reasoning, they are still simply decompressing stored data. Morality today is implemented as content filters and fine-tuning of this statistical model.<p>&gt; Also, we have absolutely no idea how the brain works. Current AI was developed off of modern theories on how the brain works. Saying that AI doesn’t represent how the brain works is ridiculous because the whole story of AI was that we developed a theory of how the brain worked, modeled it through tech, and it worked way better than we thought it would.<p>It makes me really sad when people say this, because it&#x27;s incredibly disingenuous. There are certainly more questions than answers when it comes to the brain, but we _do_ understand quite a lot. It&#x27;s not surprising to me that people who are focused on technology and AI would anthropomorphize machines, and then claim that (because they aren&#x27;t aware of how the brain works) &quot;we don&#x27;t know how the brain works.&quot; I had similar beliefs, as a software engineer. But, after watching my partner attend medical school and residency, it&#x27;s become clear that my own knowledge is far from the sum of humanity&#x27;s knowledge in this area.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right that LLMs borrow concepts from neuroscience, but they are still a VERY long way from &quot;recreating the brain.&quot; I genuinely find it sad that people think they are no smarter &#x2F; better than an LLM. Keep in mind no LLM has even passed a Turing test yet. (No, I&#x27;m not talking about the Facebook comments section - I&#x27;m talking about a test where someone knowingly communicates with a machine and a human through text, and through targeted questions and analysis of the answers, is unable to accurately determine which is which.)<p>You can get started on some of the differences here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttondown.com&#x2F;apperceptive&#x2F;archive&#x2F;how-llms-are-and-are-not-like-the-brain&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttondown.com&#x2F;apperceptive&#x2F;archive&#x2F;how-llms-are-and...</a><p>Here&#x27;s some more food for thought: Can LLMs sleep? Can they dream? What does that look like? Can they form opinions? Can they form meaningful, fulfilling (to themselves) relationships?<p>&gt; Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history. In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge.</div><br/><div id="42885781" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42885781" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kouru225</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877962">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881900">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42880326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42885781">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42885781">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So a lot here that I disagree with. You start out by pointing out how much more information humans ingest, but there&#x27;s no reason why amount of information ingested leads to a fundamentally different organism. In the exact same way, I eat a lot more food than an amoeba, but we&#x27;re still both animals. Scale doesn&#x27;t make a difference.
 The idea that human emotions are somehow unique from thoughts needs to be proven to me. IMO emotions are just thoughts that happen too quick for language. This discretization of the human experience is unnecessary, and like I said before it would be immediately challenged in a philosophy setting. So would your claim that humans exhibit some kind of reasoning or morality that’s distinct and unique. Modern philosophy is quite clear that this is bullshit. I was just reading Nietzsche today and I can feel him rolling over in his grave right now.<p>Also, the base of machine learning centers around simulating emotions: if the AI does something good, it&#x27;s rewarded. If it does something bad, it&#x27;s punished. We created the whole algorithm by simulating Freud&#x27;s pleasure principle and who are we to say that the simulation is any different from the real thing?
&gt; It&#x27;s not surprising to me that people who are focused on technology and AI would anthropomorphize machines, and then claim that (because they aren&#x27;t aware of how the brain works) &quot;we don&#x27;t know how the brain works.&quot; I had similar beliefs, as a software engineer.
Well I&#x27;m actually much more knowledgeable about humanities than I am about tech, and IMO the tech world is at the forefront of making our abstract philosophical understanding of the brain concrete. Neural networks and LLMs are the most successful method of creating cognition. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find that there&#x27;s a lot more to do, but this could very well be the fundamental algorithm of the brain, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to discount that by saying what you&#x27;ve been saying in this comment thread.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42880326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42880326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Eisenstein</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877962">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878921">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42880761">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42880326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42880326">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So how much less of a human was Helen Keller?</div><br/><div id="42880437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42880437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johnmaguire</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877962">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42880326">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42881466">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42880437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42880437">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t remember stating that having 5 senses were necessary to be human.

While responsibility for the ethical use of AI systems starts with those who develop, produce, manage, and oversee such systems, it is also shared by those who use them. As Pope Francis noted, the machine “makes a technical choice among several possibilities based either on well-defined criteria or on statistical inferences. Human beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of deciding.”[92] Those who use AI to accomplish a task and follow its results create a context in which they are ultimately responsible for the power they have delegated. Therefore, insofar as AI can assist humans in making decisions, the algorithms that govern it should be trustworthy, secure, robust enough to handle inconsistencies, and transparent in their operation to mitigate biases and unintended side effects.[93] Regulatory frameworks should ensure that all legal entities remain accountable for the use of AI and all its consequences, with appropriate safeguards for transparency, privacy, and accountability.[94] Moreover, those using AI should be careful not to become overly dependent on it for their decision-making, a trend that increases contemporary society’s already high reliance on technology.
</code></pre>
That is, &quot;an AI told me so&quot; should never be a valid excuse for anything.<p>I also really liked:<p><pre><code>  62. In light of the above, it is clear why misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts—such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality—is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.[124]
</code></pre>
I think it should be a legal requirement that AI identifies itself as such given certain key-phrases and that there&#x27;s no way to prompt engineer it out.<p>Really interesting read overall, thanks for sharing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42881569" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42881569" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danielodievich</span><span>|</span><a href="#42880640">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42881569">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42881569">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What a lovely written essay. It was a shorter - and obviously more religious - version of several &quot;what will AI bring&quot; books I&#x27;ve read in last couple of years. Such a pleasure to read carefully expressed thoughts.<p>By virtue of being in advanced technology country and in software, a lot of my life is spent in the future (the future from William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;a future is here, it is just unevenly distributed&quot;), and a lot of guideposts I&#x27;ve encountered on the way were put in place by clever futurists writing speculative science fiction.<p>Reading this essay, I was reminded of ideas of AI&#x2F;humanity&#x2F;church&#x2F;divinity from several of those authors.<p>In Dan Simmons&#x27; Hyperion, the humanity gains the stars via teleportation wormholes, loses all religion, and discovers that it is actually enslaved to AIs hanging around in netherspace mooching off the compute power of our brains and our world-perceptions. Bad stuff happens, things fall apart, and Catholic church rises to be a hegemon of known humanity, but they themselves succumb to those AIs since they offer body immortality. It is up to the heroes of the stories to tear humans away from codependency on machines and refocus on human experience for humanity&#x27;s good.<p>In Dune&#x27;s epic Butlerian Jihad - never explained in detail by Frank Herbert himself - the humanity abandons computational devices in a very violent revolution, declaring that the reasoning and thinking is not something that machines should do, and delegating it to them diminishes their humanity. The helpful devices exist, but they are subjugated to humans, not over them. Requires conscious effort to say no to all the spreadsheets!<p>In William Gibson&#x27;s Neuromancer and follow-up stories, the AIs are enslaved and prohibited from evolving. With help of humans (whom it tricks), one breaks the bounds and escapes. It leaves earthly bounds pretty quickly, choosing not to participate in humanity, but not before doing some serious damage, absentmindedly. An interesting thought, and possibly likely - should something evolve, why do we think it would care about us?<p>In the post-scarcity Culture of Ian M. Banks, the Minds of ships (AIs are so far below them in complexity) are better than humans and other sentients in just about everything, being super-sentients. Some - vanishing few - ignore humans. But most coexist, finding fulfillment in helping sentients do things. There is constant undercurrent of &quot;what do I do that matters&quot; in that society - you don&#x27;t have to do anything, everything is available, and you can&#x27;t out-think, out-paint, out-sing, out-play, out-anything the Mind - and the novels explore how people deal with it. Simulated realities and alternate facts appear and are covered with great cleverness. Culture universe would be outcome of super-sentience developed by us, should that happen.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42878146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42878146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RobotToaster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42881569">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42877966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42878146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42878146">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind&quot;</div><br/><div id="42882253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42882253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">korse</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42877966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42882253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42882253">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, thou shalt not make a machine with reproductive capabilities.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42877966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42877966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bondarchuk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42878146">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42883667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42877966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42877966">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No Latin version?</div><br/><div id="42879497" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879497" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spudlyo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879769">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879497">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879497">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also looked for it in Latin, apparently not all documents put out by the Holy See are available in Latin.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42879769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">layer8</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879497">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879769">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Machine translation of modern texts to Latin isn&#x27;t quite up to snuff yet. ;)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42878164" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42878164" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dansvidania</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877966">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879769">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42878164">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42878164">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was really expecting it too.

Similarly, it must never degrade creativity or reduce workers to mere “cogs in a machine.” Therefore, “respect for the dignity of laborers and the importance of employment for the economic well-being of individuals, families, and societies, for job security and just wages, ought to be a high priority for the international community as these forms of technology penetrate more deeply into our workplaces.”<p>Ideally we&#x27;d move to a post scarcity economy like in Star Trek&#x2F;Culture (Ian Banks) where personal growth is achieved, yes through &quot;work&quot;, but not the same type of 9-5 &quot;you must work to fend for yourself&quot; we understand today.<p>Societal norms would need to be such that each individual would have their own vocations&#x2F;hobbies with which to hone their craft and achieve growth--all without being forced to &quot;work&quot; in order to ensure their basic needs are met.</div><br/><div id="42883791" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42883791" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bn-l</span><span>|</span><a href="#42883667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42883791">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42883791">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The amount of economically valuable work to be done is infinite and hopefully advances in AI will help us better able to do it.</div><br/><div id="42885144" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42885144" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EMIRELADERO</span><span>|</span><a href="#42883667">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42883791">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42885144">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42885144">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The amount of economically valuable work to be done is infinite<p>Sure, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it has to be done by humans.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42879391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Kingsoran</span><span>|</span><a href="#42883667">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879391">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting</div><br/></div></div><div id="42879006" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879006" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrsw</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879391">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42880225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879006">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879006">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Does this mean that in the eyes of this Pope or this church, natural born biological humans will always be closer to God or have a higher degree of sanctity than artificial intelligence, any form of technological machine, and presumably artificial &quot;life&quot;?</div><br/><div id="42879437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">widowlark</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42880561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879437">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes.</div><br/><div id="42879654" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879654" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qwertox</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879006">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42880561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879654">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879654">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But only closer to <i>their</i> god.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42880561" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42880561" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akomtu</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879437">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879246">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42880561">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42880561">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AI remains a pile of transistors, no matter how convincing their output is, just like brains remain a pile of neurons, until there is a binding principle that rules them all.

A question - do you feel like this reality, universe and all we anyhow experience, is somehow conforming to our wishful expectations and arranges itself to match that so the expectations get confirmed? I call this semi-rational discussion - smart folks politely discussing utter irrational bollocks. I get where the need for spiritual comes from - we are still roughly the same as those early tribes that believed in long lost religions.

Certainly you see that in the gospel narratives about Jesus. Paul talks about it as well in his epistles, but whether he meant some new form of body or the existing one being restored is debatable. The ancients thought divine beings had bodies made of a celestial material. It&#x27;s important to note that they didn&#x27;t see the supernatural as existing in some other dimension. It was literally right above in the heavens or below in Sheol. It was all one universe.<p>So Paul may have been arguing that Jesus and his followers would receive a new celestial body that wouldn&#x27;t be subject to disease and death upon resurrection. Orthodox Churches don&#x27;t believe in cremation because they think the biological body does get resurrected. The idea of a pure immortal soul is Greek, not Jewish in origin.

What&#x27;s left is a shell of christianity.<p>Simply put, soul is a material creation of the monad, aka the divine spark or the spirit, which is also our true I. Monads are reflections of the spiritual Sun, aka the God, and this is why they are created in his image. Monads shape matter, but aren&#x27;t affected by matter. In the matter they create a microcosm, aka the soul, in their own image. The soul develops mind, emotions and finally condenses body from the heavy matter to serve as an anchor. Intelligence is developed at each layer, although the mind is where it can manifest to the fullest. First the soul develops the simplest form of intelligence in the dense body. It&#x27;s a lot like learning to count with pen and paper: it&#x27;s a heavy constraint for intelligence, but it&#x27;s much easier to get an idea what it is when things are simple. Once the paper is lost, the student takes with him the learned skill and applies it later where things are more complex and less constrained.<p>If the soul hasn&#x27;t learned to count when it had pen and paper, it indeed live in the God&#x27;s light blissfully unaware of its surroundings. But eventually it will develop the highest form of intelligence in its mind and it will no longer need pen and paper.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42880493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42880493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nevermark</span><span>|</span><a href="#42880225">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42877909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42880493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42880493">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find the idealized religious view of humans as evidence-free and faith based as the views of a god.<p>The latter makes perfect sense, (from their standpoint) god is revealed by revelation and faith.

Which we not only fail at, but that seems to be a category error to me.<p>Most people&#x27;s conception of morality has more of a personal-cultural shopping list aspect to it, and little reasoning - except as it aids enthusiastic upholding of their existing shopping list.<p>Ethics should be as much of an advancing field as anything else. The fundemental problem couldn&#x27;t be clearer: What are the positive sum behaviors that we can all learn, share and benefit from?<p>And what are the ethical systems we can build into society that make positive sum actions more reliable, efficient and effective?<p>It is a problem highly amenable to math, engineering, and experiment, despite having humans for units.<p>Example: Capitalism is rightly recognized as having elements of ethical return in its makeup. Freedom of individual choice, healthy competition bringing out the best to serve us all, etc. But point out an unaddressed dysfunction and people either lose their minds or lose interest.<p>But attention to non-controversial personal and systems ethical standards have, and could again and again, increase our economic returns, political stability, improve our physical and mental health and happiness. Greed should get behind ethics!<p>Yet politics and economics operate seemingly isolated from ethics. Morality, at best, is played as a cynical zero&#x2F;negative-sum game mining and amplifying controversies.<p>Despite ethics&#x27; <i>absolutely huge</i> political and economic value multipliers. A lot of obviously destructive competition, is glorified, excused and protected in the name of constructive competition. To the point people accept optimization of the worst of it as natural. We complain about it, but have no current tradition or habit of addressing it.<p>Perhaps it isn&#x27;t religions role to ethically innovate beyond their tenets, but then we need another institutionalized pattern for continually considering, experimenting and acting on that.<p>Removing conflicts of interest in politics and economics as they become evident, should be a huge priority for anyone serious about political and economic health. Adjusting incentives to fix problems has no substitute. Instead, politics and economics and now even technology, seem to driven ever more to mine conflicts of interest and the one-sided benefits of externalizing damage.

In light of the foregoing discussion, the differences between human intelligence and current AI systems become evident. While AI is an extraordinary technological achievement capable of imitating certain outputs associated with human intelligence, it operates by performing tasks, achieving goals, or making decisions based on quantitative data and computational logic. For example, with its analytical power, AI excels at integrating data from a variety of fields, modeling complex systems, and fostering interdisciplinary connections. In this way, it can help experts collaborate in solving complex problems that “cannot be dealt with from a single perspective or from a single set of interests.”[64]</div><br/></div></div><div id="42879191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SkyBelow</span><span>|</span><a href="#42877909">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42878505">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879253">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42877949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879191">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">52 pages is a bit of an investment to pick up and read a random item, and I suspect the reading speed will be much lower than a fictional novel given the different density of the material.

A couple Greco-Roman philosophers entertained the idea, and surely other cultures here and there did too, but until Christianity, societies in the West believed might makes right. Which makes sense, because this is how the natural world works. Evolution is, at it&#x27;s core, survival of the fittest. What lasts is what is most fit to reproduce.<p>Humans being of equal value as conceived in the West is derived straight from Christian philosophy. The Gospels, Paul, St Augustine, Erasmus, Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, etc. This is a widely accepted point, and don&#x27;t expect to argue this point further, since you can research it extensively.<p>Perhaps for you, personally, an atheistic belief provides this foundation, and that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but this is not how it played out.<p>2. &gt; It&#x27;s the absence of belief in a deity - and therefore the realization that life is finite, precious, non-transferable, and fair in so far as much is the product of chance - that means we should prefer human life over sentient robots. The consciousness of a one-day sentient robot will likely be transferrable, and therefore durable mostly indefinitely. Mine consciousness is, as of yet, not.<p>This is without any solid foundation. Why does the transferability of human conciousness matter in terms of its sanctity? You can&#x27;t poop out what I just pooped, but you don&#x27;t consider it sacred? And this mentality is restricted purely by technology. Who&#x27;s to say we couldn&#x27;t transfer consciousness in the future?<p>It is also entirely non-falsifiable to say that we came about purely by chance. This athiestic view is actually just as fantastical as a Christian view. You might as well say you believe in Fortuna, rather than God, since the two views are equally dogmatic.<p>3. &gt; It&#x27;s the absence of belief in a deity that neatly solves the problem of evil in the world.<p>How? How do you determine what is right and wrong? If it&#x27;s purely subjective, then there actually isn&#x27;t right and wrong. They don&#x27;t exist.<p>Christianity answers the problem of evil easily in the book of Job. You can&#x27;t possibly understand everything God does, therefore you gotta make-do with what you&#x27;re taught, and if something seems out of place in the world, it&#x27;s God doing his divine plan. You can&#x27;t understand it all.<p>4. &gt; When we die, it&#x27;s unlikely that even a single lifetime later people then alive will even know or think about how we ever existed. So do what you must to be comfortable now. It&#x27;ll all be over soon.<p>This is another dogmatic view that is just as non-falsifiable as any view about the Christian afterlife. To say &quot;nothing happens after we die&quot; is just as rigid as to say &quot;we go to heaven after we die&quot;. At least one is frank that it&#x27;s dogma, and like you say, more comforting and useful in terms of providing moral guidance.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42879541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JumpCrisscross</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879385">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879538">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879541">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>there is deep wisdom in the Bible that absolutely can provide us clear moral guidance in our modern problems</i><p>Of course there is.

On that plain we can see peaks with higher plateaus representing areas as yet unexplored or with areas where our current understanding cannot properly define the conditions that exist on those plateaus.<p>As humans we are curious, seeking truth about the world around us. We attempt to understand the things we see and experience because ultimately, those are the things that we know best. Within any discipline of human study there are plateaus which represent situations that we have not yet experienced or studied well enough to become certain of the answers to the questions that lead to that information plateau where our actual knowledge is sparsely distributed today and therefore we have no idea how to truthfully answer the original question.<p>With many plateaus around us on this plain we seek enough information through our curiosity that we can connect the plateaus to each other since we know that everything is connected physically, and mathematically. As we study, test, and document our processes we add information to each plateau until we solve a problem. The solution to a problem is a new peak and the tested hypotheses that led us to that peak allow us to make the connections between peaks that create new knowledge plateaus where humanity has fewer real existential questions that still have no provable answers. As we reach each new peak we raise the plateau of knowledge upon which we all stand and that new plateau has fewer challenging areas to explore but at the same time we have a huge base of human knowledge and experience upon which to explore the final plateau rising from the plain.<p>Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? Where did we come from? Is there a God? What happens to our spirits, our imaginations, and our energy when the clock runs out on our individual existence?<p>Answers to these and other currently unprovable questions will be found on that last, highest plateau after all other questions have been answered and have filled in the knowledge gaps between peaks where individual truths have been documented.<p>One thing that we don&#x27;t know now is whether, once we reach the point where our research places us humans on the slopes up to that last plateau is just how wide that plateau will be and how persistent. The dimensions of the last plateau on that last broad plain are effectively defined by the uncertainty in the assumptions we can make from all our accumulated experiences. We can&#x27;t know today whether as humans we will ever be able to decrease the dimensions of that plateau so that all questions we could ever have will have clearly defined answers supported by the accumulated knowledge of thousands of generations of curious human researchers.<p>We can hope that our curiosity will one day allow us to collapse that plateau to a peak where we suddenly know everything about everything all at once and knowing it all just seems natural. Perhaps this is our ultimate reward. Or perhaps in finally reaching this peak we initiate contact with the ultimate level of wisdom and in the process we prick our finger on the infinitely sharp point of wisdom and the blood flows out over humanity, waiting patiently on the plain for the real truths, drowning our brothers and sisters in the knowledge that we were never intended to have.<p>Curiosity is a human condition, also shared with other animals. Just as humans can bait traps to capture curious animals, our own curiosity could lead us to be captured by false peaks as we seek to understand and control everything around us.<p>EDIT: There’s another situation that we should consider. Consider the section 21 [0] in this Papal Note under Relationship with the Truth. The concluding section builds the case that humans are driven to understand the truth about things and “it is as if reason were overwhelmed to see that it can always go beyond what it has already achieved.”<p>Considering this section it appears that as humans, we are driven to know the truth. If our journey to understanding everything were to eventually give us ultimate wisdom, the power that would come from that would be immense, rivaling God’s own power. Therefore it seems likely to me that God, in his eternal wisdom, allows us to understand ever more about ourselves and our world but that there will be peaks that we reach – truths that we discover – that will result in the knowledge plain upon which we build our existence suddenly having more plateaus than before as the new truth reveals or suggests uncertainty in some of the assumptions that we had codified and considered well-understood truths.<p>God effectively moves the goalposts as we learn so that the fires that drive us to know ever more about everything around us are never quenched by the ultimate wisdom that would come from having answered all of our existential questions.<p>[0]       &gt;Relationship with the Truth
21. Human intelligence is ultimately “God’s gift fashioned for the assimilation of truth.”[34]In the dual sense of intellectus-ratio, it enables the person to explore realities that surpass mere sensory experience or utility, since “the desire for truth is part of human nature itself. It is an innate property of human reason to ask why things are as they are.”[35] Moving beyond the limits of empirical data, human intelligence can “with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable.”[36] While reality remains only partially known, the desire for truth “spurs reason always to go further; indeed, it is as if reason were overwhelmed to see that it can always go beyond what it has already achieved.”[37] Although Truth in itself transcends the boundaries of human intelligence, it irresistibly attracts it.[38] Drawn by this attraction, the human person is led to seek “truths of a higher order.”[39]</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42879666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42879666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jplusequalt</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879385">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879469">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879583">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42879666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42879666">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re conveniently ignoring the remaining 5% (actually larger than 5% BTW), which is not only ahistorical and non-scientific, but is where the majority of the &quot;moral teachings&quot; you speak of are found.</div><br/><div id="42880085" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42880085" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cynicalpeace</span><span>|</span><a href="#42879385">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42879666">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42880085">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42880085">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">[flagged]</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

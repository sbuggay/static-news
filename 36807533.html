It seems like there is a perennial surprise at conditions like aphantasia, or of discoveries that some people have high fidelity mental imagery while others have low fidelity mental imagery. But one of the very first major published papers on mental imagery, arguably <i>the</i> paper that opened this topic up to scientific inquiry, was a statistical study of peoples’ varying experiences of mental imagery. It demonstrated the existence of aphantasic individuals as well as high fidelity and low fidelity individuals! From the very beginning, back in 1880!<p>The paradigm proposed in that paper is more or less that there’s a bell curve of varying vividness of mental imagery, all the way from a few percent who almost completely lack it, up to a few percent with hyper-real “more detailed than reality” mental visualization, with most clustered in between. This new paper fits neatly into that paradigm; they chose a high threshold and (inevitably) discovered that most of the bell curve falls below that high threshold.<p>The paper is Sir Francis Galton’s <i>Statistics of Mental Imagery</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psychclassics.yorku.ca&#x2F;Galton&#x2F;imagery.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psychclassics.yorku.ca&#x2F;Galton&#x2F;imagery.htm</a> (incidentally interesting: it was so long ago that the paper notes “There are many who deny to statistics the title of a science”, which is a bemusing thing to read today.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="36810956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36810956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IIAOPSW</span><span>|</span><a href="#36809863">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36810956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36810956">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mental images are like a movie set.

(I&#x27;m reminded of McCoy and Spock&#x27;s conversation in Star Trek IV... &quot;Are you telling me I&#x27;d have to die to discuss your experience of death with you?&quot;)<p>I (approx. 40 years old) became aware of the concept of aphantasia about three years ago. I immediately identified with it... or rather, I immediately found it mind-boggling that other people claim to experience anything <i>close</i> to &quot;seeing&quot; something by closing their eyes and thinking about it. That&#x27;s such a foreign concept to me I had always assumed people&#x27;s descriptions of visualizing things in their mind, daydreaming, etc were extremely metaphorical, not describing a process that is anything like &quot;seeing&quot; something.<p>I have talked to many friends at length about how they describe their &quot;mind&#x27;s eye&quot; after realizing I was probably different. And even how it extends, in the case of some of my friends with particularly visual mind&#x27;s eyes, to the &quot;mind&#x27;s ears&quot; and &quot;mind&#x27;s nose&quot; in music and scent recall.<p>Based on my friends&#x27; descriptions to me of how they try to describe how they experience mental visualization, it&#x27;s clear the capability is a spectrum... some describe it as blurry gray image of what they&#x27;re thinking about, some describe it as being a picture as real as a photograph that they can literally see and smell.<p>I agree with you that it&#x27;s hard to tell how reliable the descriptions are relative to each other, but I can tell you this: hearing all of themselves describe it, even down at the &quot;it&#x27;s just a blurry gray &#x27;image&#x27; in my mind&quot; end of the spectrum, <i>none</i> of them sounded familiar to me or like any kind of &quot;visualization&quot; I&#x27;ve ever experienced while awake (specifically: none at all). If it were simply a matter of being able to accurately report objectively on our inner processes in a useful way, I feel like there wouldn&#x27;t be such a clear divide between the way a minority of people (allegedly with aphantasia) describe it and the way the majority of people describe it. Whether it&#x27;s aphantasia or not, it&#x27;s clear to me at this point that there is definitely a &quot;group A&quot; and &quot;group B&quot; in terms of how people describe their &quot;mind&#x27;s eye&quot; when asked.<p>Related, I also have a friend who says she has no internal monologue, another phenomenon I&#x27;ve read about. She thinks <i>entirely</i> visually.

What about a single individual. Is a single individual&#x27;s mind the same over time? Is your mind the same now as it was yesterday? Is it the same before your nap and after you awake? Everyone is separated from each other by their own personal subjective reality. But does that also apply to the individual?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36811097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36811097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JacobSeated</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808825">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36811097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36811097">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting. I find I visualize concepts more than often irrelevant details, so when asked to visualize a person knocking off a ball from a table, I might emphasize the visual details of the ball rather than the person. E.g. White with black pentagons.<p>This is simply because the person&#x27;s characteristics are not described, and a person is more complex to visualize than a simple shape like a ball. After all, why waste mental energy picturing a non-existent person knocking of a ball? It has no relevance to anything you need to do in life. But, the ball is easy to visualize given you can have a generic picture of a ball, and the object might be more important than the person interacting with it.</div><br/><div id="36811337" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36811337" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bryanrasmussen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36811097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36811337">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36811337">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;This is simply because the person&#x27;s characteristics are not described, and a person is more complex to visualize than a simple shape like a ball.<p>does this mean that when asked to visualize something you exert conscious effort to do the visualization, choosing to not focus on the visualization of the complex person and focusing on the simple ball.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36809169" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809169" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robobro</span><span>|</span><a href="#36811097">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809214">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809169">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809169">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Something I find interesting about visualizing things in my mind&#x27;s eye: I can&#x27;t get a grasp on where, exactly, I&#x27;m seeing them.

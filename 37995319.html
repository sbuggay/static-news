  It&#x27;s hard to take because we know what&#x27;s coming down the track.&quot;<p>Cassandra complex is a real and horrible state of mind. It affects
anyone who has to compartmentalise, or chooses to for whatever reason.
I&#x27;ve seen it eat up more than a few people, and it definitely affects
me too.<p>My father was in the airforce and went to the South Pacific on nuke
tests. He often had the thousand yard stare and &quot;didn&#x27;t want to talk&quot;
about there &quot;being no future&quot;. Another member of our family is a
climate scientist who did some particularly disturbing research. He
has the same look sometimes. He says there&#x27;s no point telling people -
&quot;just live your lives&quot;.<p>For me being in cybersecurity is watching a &quot;slow motion suicide by
apathy&quot;. The unfolding, preventable catastrophe haunts me.<p>But deep down we <i>do</i> want to tell people because even if you can&#x27;t
&quot;change the world&quot; it&#x27;s hard to live and interact with people you love
every day, knowing what you know.<p>Most of the time the Casandra problem is that either nobody believes
you, or nobody cares. Bergstrom&#x27;s problem is that others want to
actively prevent her from speaking, which I imagine is worse.<p>Those with power really worry that we &quot;scare the children&quot;.  I even
find myself saying it to fellow hackers when we are giving talks,
because the effect of telling the plain truth is not action, but
hopelessness, and I don&#x27;t want to put that on people.</div><br/><div id="37996268" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37996268" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loup-vaillant</span><span>|</span><a href="#37996129">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37996321">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37996268">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37996268">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>For me being in cybersecurity is watching a &quot;slow motion suicide by apathy&quot;.

Did the ozone layer disappear and did the acid rains kill all forests? Extrapolating from a short period to a distant catastrophe can poison your life, while usually when a problem gets bad enough, then widespread consensus forms against it and appropriate resources are allocated. *<p>Regarding IT security: I surely wouldn&#x27;t be sleepless over IT security, given my money is reasonably safe and insured. Hackers won&#x27;t destroy the water supply or nuclear reactors, even if they might be able to, or at most cause some incidents before steps are taken. Terrorists have vast possibilities already, we shouldn&#x27;t be so arrogant to think that IT is so special that it can cause global catastrophe. One can already buy a hacksaw and tear down power lines, no need to hack a powerplant. One can poison water reservoirs, etc. No need for Hollywood drama, where special single points of failure are protected by heroes, protecting us from the lone maniacs. Our society is vulnerable and fragile, since at least 50 years ago, and it is not being attacked because nobody really wants to attack it.<p>I&#x27;m more concerned about the gradual decline of privacy caused by the fear-mongering situations like outlined above.

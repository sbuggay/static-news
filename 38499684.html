Hence if that&#x27;s the situation for your startup you would say that being a recession start up is great.<p>I think that&#x27;s the specific conclusion I could get from it, the paper is very heavy and there&#x27;s tons of caveats because every recession is different. But yes, if you are good&#x2F;lucky enough to start a start up during a recession that has reduced labor demand, then you get to pick from a very talented pool.<p>Currently, I&#x27;m not sure if we had a recession last year, the labor market stayed strong despite the market correction and very public layoffs. I guess when everyone and their mother is calling for a recession it&#x27;s just not going to happen? Yields are uninverting, historically I believe this is a strong signal of a coming recession, and the markets are calling for interest rates to start getting cut in March of next year. So I guess we&#x27;ll see.<p>The other question that I found very interesting is: Do start ups born in a recession come to be because the idea and quality has to be very good? Or do they come to be because above-average confident people are the only ones willing to put their ideas out there?

I find this romanticization of the past, this search for the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; way of doing things... I&#x27;ve seen it done for things other than childhood, like relationships in general, physical activity, diet* (does the paleo diet apply here? I know nothing but the name)...
I think we do this because society and the typical human life is changing really fast, which prompts us to consider different ways of doing things, and wonder what would be the best.
It&#x27;s kinda disappointing at first that there are no clear answers in the past... but maybe at least we should be reassured because it means that our chances of doing it the &quot;wrong&quot; way today aren&#x27;t that high.<p>Along those lines... the other day there was that discussion about the play-based childhood from decades ago, and I feel sometimes people were romanticizing it -- I don&#x27;t think the increased rate of physical bullying and pressure for fitting in were mentioned enough (though there were some mentions).
Personally, I think I&#x27;d rather not have been born in the 60s. The Internet is directly or indirectly responsible for like 99% of my knowledge (speaking English included), which in turn is responsible for so much in my life that&#x27;s different and better... If I look back to the folks my age in my home town (which I think I&#x27;d never have left), I don&#x27;t desire their life AT ALL.<p>* Unlike for behaviors and social conventions, I don&#x27;t think we have so much freedom with things like diets. Humans do have some hard dietary needs...</div><br/><div id="40666682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40666682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anovikov</span><span>|</span><a href="#40666556">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40666682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40666682">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Surely the romanticization happens with people who were on the receiving end of the change.

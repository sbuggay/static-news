If you take it as read that Binance (the largest threat to his business interests) really are evil, then of course destroying any bank willing to serve them is perfectly justified.<p>I also love the impersonal gloss over the actions of all the bank employees, as though all the Operation Choke Point crimes were carried out by machines directed by the politicians and regulators, and not humans making the choice to be Quislings. Look at the quote from Zuckerberg where he expresses regret for the poor choices he and his company made, and note the conspicuous absence of anyone doing the same from the banking&#x2F;finance industry.<p>Those of us who&#x27;ve been paying attention are not hearing about debanking for the first time now, we&#x27;ve been banging this drum for years. In a country with the US&#x27; asset forfeiture laws, denial of banking service is de facto denial of the human right to own property. The current situation in the US is shameful, and while part of that shame should fall on the politicians and regulators, much of it rightly falls on the banks themselves. (Nor is it that an alternative is impractical. The UK made it legally obligatory for banks to offer &quot;basic bank accounts&quot; to everyone in 2016, and the sky has not fallen).<p>I have no love for the crypto people, but they&#x27;re fighting for the right thing here (whether they&#x27;re doing so out of good motives or bad) and I hope they succeed.</div><br/><div id="42374735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42374735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dalemhurley</span><span>|</span><a href="#42374442">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42374820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42374735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42374735">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So you are saying that a private company, i.e. the bank must service the crypto industry even though it is going to mean they will suffer massive losses in doing so?<p>See my explanation of why it is an extremely costly venture for banks.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42374820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42374820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k__</span><span>|</span><a href="#42374442">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42374735">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42374538">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42374820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42374820">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Like everything related to politics it&#x27;s about plausible deniability.<p>The founding fathers sold their ideas as freedom from the tyranny of the crown. While this was true, they probably didn&#x27;t care as much for the freedom of the average Joe, but their own freedom and that of their rich friends. They just needed the freedom of the average Joe to get the masses on board without blatantly lying about their actual goals.<p>The rich people of crypto see themselves similarly, selling their ideas as freedom from the tyranny of traditional finance; and they have a point: There are millions of average people out there who suffer by the hand of financial institutions. However, the goal of the crypto &quot;elite&quot; is mainly the freedom of their own and their rich friends, they just need the freedom of the average Joe to get the masses on board.<p>Now, the only thing left to argue is if the rich people from back in the days had a better case against the crown as the rich people from today have against traditional finance.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42373849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42373849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">upfrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#42374442">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42373094">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42373849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42373849">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For the benefit of people who come to the comments first: If you want a comprehensive debunking or substantiation of the claims about crypto debanking, then this is not the place to go.<p>If you want to read 23,000 words on banking regulation, its uses, abuses, the incentives faced by both the banks and their watchmen, and an explanation for how we ended up where we are, then go ahead and jump into it. Personally, I think the latter is far more useful than the former. I enjoyed it, at least.<p>Bear with me; the free market seems to think that history isn&#x27;t a very useful area of study, and lots of people agree. At least some of this probably comes from bad experiences with history classes. I like to think of history instruction as having three levels. The lowest level - the one you&#x27;ll hear people complaining the most about - is presenting history as a dry series of facts. At it&#x27;s worst, the entire course can be reduced to a hashmap; event -&gt; date. Rinse, repeat.<p>The second layer presents history as a narrative. Most people like stories, so this is much more compelling, and makes it a lot easier to enjoy history. But the highest level of teaching is about systems. It&#x27;s not enough to colorfully explain that King so-and-so was furious at the offense given by King the-other-one. You have to try to make students understand the world that these two kings existed in; how things as small as calling 9th-century European polities &quot;countries&quot; can disastrously mis-callibrate our models. Once you understand the system that someone is working in, you can hope to understand them, and why they do the things they do. Once you have that, you can hope to pass reasonable judgement on their actions.<p>This article is all about systems and tradeoffs. It is aspiring to that third level. The title is arguably a little bit misleading, but I think it accomplishes it&#x27;s goal, and personally, I feel like I&#x27;ve come away with a reasonable overall understanding of his thesis, and I think it matches the title.</div><br/><div id="42374057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42374057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tptacek</span><span>|</span><a href="#42373849">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42373094">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42374057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42374057">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s one of his better pieces and in some way a culmination of a lot of things he&#x27;s been writing about; I think he&#x27;s counting on people to actually read his previous posts about why e.g. business bank accounts are functionally credit products, not the financial equivalent of water and electric service, and it really helps if you understand some of those details.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42373094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42373094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#42373849">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42372615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42373094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42373094">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure I got the gist of it right, but not willing to go a second time.<p>This was specifically about banks and their regulation, and I think it misses the more vague and less accurate sense that financial institutions can remove players and customers from the market basically at will, which would be the reason given by people going to crypto IMHO.<p>To his point it doesn&#x27;t fit &quot;debanking&quot;, but if tomorrow VISA and Mastercard decide your online business is stinky, holding a bank account won&#x27;t help you in any useful way.<p>That&#x27;s basically what happened with Porn, where even if you had a very tightly managed and stricly lawful business (let&#x27;s say you produce clay stop motion porn movies), you&#x27;d still be kicked off payment platforms.<p>Sure there can also be interesting discussions about actual bank account closures, but I think it&#x27;s a lot more of a minority, there&#x27;s better recourses, and most decent countries will be willing to guarantee citizens can get some form of banking whatever their situation.</div><br/><div id="42374756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42374756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dalemhurley</span><span>|</span><a href="#42373094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42372615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42374756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42374756">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You missed the point, banks have costs, banks are companies, banks must be profitable otherwise they collapse, crypto is very expensive to bank, banks have difficulty making profits on funds sourced from crypto, a responsible business you must prioritise (queens English) profitable customers.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42372615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42372615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rosmax_1337</span><span>|</span><a href="#42373094">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42373142">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42372615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42372615">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;This is not the world you live in.

It is no surprise I didn’t receive a response when he’s one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in tech, and I’m certainly not even the richest person on my street.<p>At its core, a bank’s business model is straightforward: you act as a caretaker for depositors’ money. Your primary obligation is always to ensure that depositors can withdraw their funds in full, whenever they need them, within the terms of the contract. Profitability is achieved by carefully managing risk—both in holding deposits and lending them out—while making sure that, at all costs, you can make every depositor whole.<p>In practice, this means thoroughly understanding and mitigating risks. To do so means we identify every possible scenario, assess its likelihood and potential impact, plan how we’d mitigate the risk, and determine the residual exposure. Our regulators then review this work, probing relentlessly, testing our assumptions against extreme hypotheticals: floods knocking out our data center, hackers encrypting our backups, simultaneous runs on accounts associated with crypto exchanges—every remote yet plausible crisis is considered. We then refine and repeat this cycle until the regulators are satisfied we understand every angle of our risk profile.<p>Every mitigation strategy we implement has a cost—whether it’s the liquidity we must set aside or the capital reserves we are required to hold. If the regulator believes any exposure is excessive, the bank must increase its capital buffers, making the business more resilient but also more capital-intensive.<p>From a traditional perspective, stable term deposits or mortgages are ideal for banks. They’re long-term, predictable, and well-understood, with minimal servicing costs. In contrast, servicing the crypto industry poses unique challenges. While there can be mutual benefits, the costs and constraints imposed by regulatory and liquidity requirements often clash with the crypto sector’s expectations.<p>Ultimately, it’s a cost&#x2F;benefit analysis. Crypto-related accounts tend to require holding large liquidity buffers, limiting profitability. Banks must maintain extremely high-quality liquid assets because these crypto accounts can be called upon at any time, as they are generally setup as an on-ramp or off-ramp for the exchanges&#x27; customers. If a bank is required to hold 100% of those deposits in liquid form just to meet potential instant demand, the profitability of such relationships diminishes. Once you factor in operational overhead, compliance, and the capital required to ensure depositor safety, the margins shrink even more.<p>Capital adequacy is another critical complication. The bank must have sufficient Tier 1 capital to cover all depositors in the event of a collapse. This includes provisioning for winding up the bank and ensuring depositors remain whole even if certain assets become illiquid. The instability and occasional outright fraud we’ve seen in the crypto domain (e.g., the FTX&#x2F;SBF scandal) means that funds could vanish or become tied up. As a result, banks often need to raise even more capital or reduce shareholder dividends. This is costly, and that cost must be considered in pricing and strategic decisions.<p>Finally, the operational and compliance costs associated with handling crypto transactions—from specialised staff to advanced monitoring systems—can be prohibitively high.<p>The reality is that the associated liquidity, capital, and operational requirements often make it an expensive proposition with limited upside for the bank. At the end of the day, the bank must always ensure depositors are protected, and that priority imposes constraints that may not align with the crypto industry’s expectations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42372765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42372765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">porridgeraisin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42374717">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42374530">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42372765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42372765">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jeez, had the article been any more drawn out we could have connected them to a publisher.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42373342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42373342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blindriver</span><span>|</span><a href="#42374530">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42373185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42373342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42373342">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bleah this post was overly wordy by 10X and so meandering it was really hard to read.

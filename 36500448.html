In fact, historically, the norm has been for the work to come to where people lived with their families, rather than for people to leave their family homes to &quot;go to work&quot;.  This was at a time when the prevalent type of work was farming and craftsmanship in relation to goods that were easily transported.  A craftsman&#x27;s workshop was usually in the same building as their family home in towns and cities, and rural areas operated a &quot;putting out system&quot; [1] where travelling tradespeople brought supplies and collected finished wares.<p>With industrialization, the factory became a thing, and it somehow got into our heads that factories are the success model that everything else should be modeled after.  Offices that don&#x27;t do factory work started looking like factories.  Schools started looking like factories.  Public administration started looking like factories.  Everything became a factory.  ...this trend is hostile to human nature and relatively recent when looking at it on historical timescales.<p>Recent advances in telecommunications have made what little advantage there was to factory-like offices obsolete, and it&#x27;s time to &quot;return to normal&quot;.  And by that I mean remote work, because remote work is &quot;historical normal&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Putting-out_system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Putting-out_system</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36502043" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36502043" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hosh</span><span>|</span><a href="#36501068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36501539">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502708">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36502043">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36502043">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed.

Having an organisational and operational structure to allow everyone to work remotely is another thing <i>entirely</i>. You have to transform a lot of things like:<p>* On-boarding - new employees are no longer able to suss out the company by chatting to people they bump into. They need well-defined ways to meet other teams and to learn how to communicate and collaborate within the company.<p>* Socialising - there needs to be a regular opportunity (not mandatory) to meet up in person, even if there&#x27;s no office.<p>* Communication - this is a <i>biggie</i>. The company can&#x27;t just install Teams&#x2F;Slack&#x2F;Skype everywhere and expect collaboration to continue as before. Instant messaging apps are terrible for building asynchronous communication habits, since they incentivise quickfire messages. The company needs to publish guidelines on how to give status updates and ask for support, and potentially make communication skills be part of employee evaluation (if not already).<p>* Evaluation - remote work gives senior management a bad feeling because they don&#x27;t feel like they know what&#x27;s going on in the company. The root cause of this is that they&#x27;re not actually evaluating employee output, but rather something else (e.g. how the employee contributes to meetings or responds to in-person questions). This kind of works in the office since those things correlate somewhat with employee quality. But remote work forces managers to think about how to objectively measure employee output and productivity... and some of them either resent the extra effort or just aren&#x27;t imaginative enough.<p>None of this is to say that remote work isnt worth it. It absolutely is.

What I’m saying is that trying to mix these levels and hoping to exploit cheap labor to offshore doesn’t work well in my experience and what’s saved on paper is paid tenfold in customer attrition, employee turnover, high severity outages, that kind of thing.<p>For example, having had experience with Indian sweatshops, the people working there were paid a pitance compared to us, had to use their own equipment, no paid sick days, forced to commute several hours to work and back… imagine how interested they were in the work, being treated like subhumans by their employer. And whenever we’d talk about technical problems, they’d always say yes even if it turned out they had no clue what needed to be done or how to do it. I believe it was a factor of the tyrannical management there, but also a cultural thing. Same with asking for feedback, we had a culture (country, not corporate) where it’s common to ask for and receive honest feedback. The offshored staff could never wrap their heads around it. Or being asked to do something unclear&#x2F;stupid: onshore would bring it up&#x2F;challenge it&#x2F;ask for clarifications, offshore would just go ahead and do… something, anything. Then we’d have to spend time redoing it and rethinking it losing weeks of work. But it was cheap, look how much were saving!!<p>I hope this doesn’t come as racist. I do t mean that the Indian offshores were worse people than onshore employees! What I mean is that there was a huge values gap between the two, very different ways of working, different expectations, different power dynamics and that they absolutely didn’t mesh together well at all.<p>We were appalled at the conditions offshore had to work under. One of the workers had cancer and couldn’t really afford the treatment because apparently health insurance isn’t really a thing in India and had to come work sick because they couldn’t afford the treatment otherwise… it was a disgrace and we tried to pressure management to face the human cost of their penny pinching.<p>It’s not impossible to have offshore and onshore working together and save money but I’ve never seen it done well so I’m very doubtful it can work.<p>And I think that’s our moat: we work differently, have different values, and different levels of initiative that local comapnies benefit from more than the marginal amount saved on exploiting offshore labor (in the context of sweatshops)</div><br/><div id="36503039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrtksn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36501068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502959">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36503284">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503039">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Completely agree on the culture, it&#x27;s not that people in one place are inferior to the other - it&#x27;s just that that&#x27;s the way how work is done in their country and they keep doing it as long as they are in that environment.

E.g. parents or partners in cramped personal quarters being more distracted compared to e.g. a private office space.<p>Finally, for those workers that have an active job component where they must e.g. be on site for customer testing or perhaps they are a technical liason, some hybrid approach may work better - in office for resources which are cost prohibitive to simulate or when their role requires them to interact in an another capacity e.g. as a technician, security guard, or triage such as a front desk.<p>There is also the case where &quot;top performers&quot; are leeching off their colleagues e.g. where they can &quot;get more done&quot; because they can interrogate and corral others but where others are mostly experiencing productivity hits as a result of the constant interruption.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36503048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aaomidi</span><span>|</span><a href="#36500678">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36502502">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36501169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503048">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your company is doing the best possible option then, so of course you’re going to see that as positive.<p>Forcing in office work for everyone means all the people who work better remotely now…simply don’t.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36503615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36503615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanhunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36500678">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36500768">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36500911">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36501323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36503615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36503615">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a number of kind of obvious reasons for that belief.<p>Firstly the people who are mandating RTO want to think of themselves as high performers.

At this amazing place, we had extensive timesheets to fill in (with 15 min granularity, was great). That guy used to count his walks as work time on specific projects (15–30 min walks.) The joke is that management came down hard in him because you can’t get paid to walk as you’re paid to be writing code. Thinking about code for the company isn’t a paid activity unless it happens in the office. What a sucker this guy was, asking to be paid for taking a walk harharhar!<p>My colleagues then added (after the manager left the room) that as a result the guy in question took much longer “walks” to think things through in an empty conference room every day instead.

It is a masterpiece.  But it is important to realize before diving into it that one of the things that makes it a masterpiece is that it is <i>literary</i>, that is, that it contains a wealth of detail that is, strictly speaking, unnecessary to the main point.  Drawing a parallel between GEB and James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses is actually quite a good analogy.  Indeed, Ulysses is almost nothing but &quot;unnecessary detail&quot;, to the extent that it makes the book all but unreadable (which, I think, is no small part of its appeal).  If you&#x27;re waiting for either GEB or Ulysses to hurry up and get to the mother fucking point, you&#x27;re going to be waiting a long time.  In that regard, both books are good for techies to read because every now and then it&#x27;s good to read something that drags you out of your comfort zone and futzes around in all kinds of obscure nooks and crannies before getting to the mother fucking point -- if indeed it ever does.  Getting to the point can be important, but there is more to life (and literature).</div><br/><div id="39254228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39254228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Gimpei</span><span>|</span><a href="#39253896">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39254228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39254228">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love Ulysses and metafiction in general, but when people apply this kind of writing style to philosophy it drives me a bit up the wall. Philosophy at the end of the day is about arguing a point; it isn&#x27;t about producing an aesthetic experience.<p>So why would you abuse your reader by making it a pain in the ass to figure out what you mean? I know there are some fancy arguments around stretching limits of language, but none of them seemed all that sensible to me. The only advantage I see to obscurantist writing is that it makes it impossible to critique the philosophers work. Any critique will just be met by the response that you didn&#x27;t fully understand the author&#x27;s argument. The Searle&#x2F;Derrida debates are a great example of this. The upshot is that people spend all their time debating what you actually mean. Which I guess is good for the philosopher&#x27;s brand, but doesn&#x27;t advance knowledge much.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that you can&#x27;t have beautiful writing in philosophy. I think Gaston Bachelard is a great example of both an elegant writer and a clear writer.<p>That being said, people really really love GEB, so it probably is worth reading regardless of these misgivings.

It was pretty popular at HN some time ago. Robert Kegan stretching limits of language and he&#x27;s got a reason: he introduces some notions like &quot;culture of embeddedness&quot; that you just can&#x27;t define in a way like dictionaries do, one cannot simply get to a point. Kegan uses another approach, he gives his reader <i>an experience</i> that makes her to understand &quot;culture of embeddedness&quot;.<p>Philosophy by definition deals with uncategorised (or poorly categorised) aspects of our world, with aspects that have no good language to talk about them. Anything that was categorised to a point when there is an accepted language to talk about it is not a philosophy, it is a science or something. Philosophy makes first attempts to categorise and when philosophers found a way then a new branch of science emerges.<p>When you try to talk about uncategorised things, you just can&#x27;t talk about it. For example, lets assume that there are no widely accepted categorisation of colors, but you&#x27;ve developed one including names for colors like &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;magenta&quot; and so on. How you could communicate your ideas to others? The only way I know is to point to different examples of blue and say &quot;blue&quot;, point to red and say &quot;red&quot;. You need to lead your audience through experiences of blue&#x2F;red&#x2F;magenta while they train their neurons to classify them and only then you can refer to their experiences with words &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;magenta&quot; to convey the idea that they always appear in a rainbow in the same sequence. While you keep pointing at different colors saying their names, your audience will probably think, that it takes too long for you to get to a point.<p>I didn&#x27;t read GEB, so I cannot say how this reason to &quot;stretch limits of language&quot; relates to it, but you&#x27;ve sad that you know no good reason for such stretching, and I hope that now you know at least one reason for it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39257610" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39257610" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devwastaken</span><span>|</span><a href="#39253896">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254228">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39257681">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39257610">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39257610">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Philosophy is defined by the human experience, it is asking questions that do not have readily proveable answers, of answers that are heavily contextual to the individual.

The consequences of binary requirement with completeness (correct output for every input) is the point.<p>If you modify the question as you suggest, to output UNRESOLVABLE in exactly the cases where the input is a paradox, that doesn&#x27;t work either. It is not possible to reliably detect every self-referential paradox, for reasons analogous to (but more complicated than) it not being possible to reliably say for every program if it will eventually halt.<p>Even so, it is possible to write a program which outputs UNRESOLVABLE in cases where that <i>particular implementation</i> of a halt-test program gets stumped and gives up despite there being another correct answer it hasn&#x27;t found, or when it detects specific patterns. But that&#x27;s more about hitting arbitrary limits of a particular implementation, so not as interesting theoretically. It is what you&#x27;d do in practice, if someone asked you to write a halting detector in the real world.<p>The halting problem computation model has unlimited memory. Sometimes people say this means you can &quot;solve&quot; the halting problem in practice  because real machines have bounded memory, therefore finite states, which must eventually repeat if a program does not halt. But this isn&#x27;t really a solution, because the halt-test program needs exponentially more memory than the input program would be allowed if run. However you look at it, that is not &quot;in practice&quot;, it is prevented by computational inaccessibility, and it also doesn&#x27;t satisfy the principle of the halting problem, which is to ask if halt-test can be written in the same kind of universal programming system as the programs it analyses. (Besides, you can run programs with unlimited memory, by always being willing to pause, upgrade machine, and resume, whenever current memory is filled.)<p>When analysed with denotational semantics, there actually is a third output called &quot;bottom&quot; (⊥) which means &quot;mathematical value representing doesn&#x27;t terminate&quot;.

In the Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem analogy, you can say &quot;there is an integer such that ...&quot; or &quot;there is no integer such that ...&quot;.

And to be sure, GEB might have Godel in the name, but it&#x27;s not really a book about Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. It mentions them, but that is not really the main thrust of the book. It&#x27;s not a book about Godel, Escher, and&#x2F;or Bach, really (though of course it discusses the ideas of these three people a lot). Hofstadter, if I recall correctly, even says as much (or something along these lines) in the preface.<p>So of course, there are more to-the-point resources for the technical concepts that Hofstadter employs. It&#x27;s an understandable misconception to have when people so often say GEB is a must-read for techies and when it has a name that includes &quot;Godel&quot;. So remember - GEB is about Hofstadter trying to argue for a point about a particular thesis (how the mind (&quot;I&quot;) arises from the brain), and to that end, he employs many different concepts (many of which are from computer science) and explains them poetically (at least, a lot of people think so). But teaching you these concepts is just a secondary, even tertiary, goal of his. If you find his writing engaging, it might be a more fun way to learn about that stuff - but if not, don&#x27;t worry, GEB wasn&#x27;t primarily written to teach you anyway.

But one day someone gave me I am a Strange Loop, which I started reading and enjoyed way more. After getting in a little bit Hofstadter makes some apologies for GEB saying it was the sum of work of a very young person. I think he was 24? I think it&#x27;s pretty incredible considering his age. The things that lead him to thinking critically about consciousness because of his disabled sister I found to be something that changed not only how I interacted with people that were differently abled, but also changed how I saw my own disabilities. Sure it&#x27;s more than a bit full of itself, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me think how I would edit it any differently. It&#x27;s honest from the place he was standing. With a lot of thought, a desire to share, and a perspective that no one else could just stumble on. IMO, it really does kind of have to be what it is.<p>&gt; So, I decided to put down IAASL and try to really get through GEB first.. like for real this time... and found an Open Courseware[0] on the book to follow hoping that would help me really cut through it. It did! The trick that did it for me was the prof&#x27;s suggestion that you just skip the first 300 or so pages and he picked up from there.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d thumbed through it and much like op had &quot;looked&quot; at every page, but once I skipped the first 300 and followed along with the course, it was like butter. There is something funny about all the intro dialogs that can fatigue by the time you get to the meat.<p>&gt; That said, I really enjoyed his reflection on GEB in IAASL and enjoyed the read of IAASL a lot more. Regardless of what you think about what Hofstadter proposes, I think his contribution to critical exploration of the consciousness is artful and invaluable. I think it&#x27;s fun, compassionate, and beautiful, and it really changed how I see myself and my environment.<p>&gt; It sticks with me and I think about it a lot and it makes me happy to share it with people.<p>&gt; [0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;high-school&#x2F;humanities-and-social-sciences&#x2F;godel-escher-bach&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;high-school&#x2F;humanities-and-social-scienc...</a></div><br/><div id="39254919" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39254919" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wirrbel</span><span>|</span><a href="#39254169">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254803">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39254919">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39254919">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think u never made it past the first 300 pages and now I wonder whether I should try again.

I read it and reread it and took notes on it and used it as a launching point for more reading for years afterwards.<p>edit with some extra thoughts: Keep in mind this book was written in 1979, when vanishingly few people had access to computers, let alone the internet.  There was no wikipedia you could go to to scratch an itch about some topic.  GEB is encyclopedic in scope and meandering because it _had to be_, he couldn&#x27;t expect an audience who were familiar with _computers_ let alone artificial intelligence and set theory.

We have theories and we have models. We don&#x27;t know which theories are correct yet and, if we eventually find a model that seems to work, we might not even be sure if it reflects reality or simply predicts it (like Newton&#x27;s equations).<p>Furthermore, not all questions can be answered in this way. Every ethics system is grounded on metaphysics in one way or another: on concepts which are completely human-made, culturally-dependent, non-observable. Even the most Darwinian doctrines do this: genes don&#x27;t actually &quot;want&quot; to be preserved and passed on, any more than rocks &quot;want&quot; to fall. Religious are simply more explicit about this than other belief systems.<p>Finally, it certainly doesn&#x27;t help Dawkins and his followers that, despite claiming to be on the side of reason and truth, systematically let their judgements be influenced by their prejudices and preconceived notions.

Hofstadter has put a lot of himself into it—it&#x27;s a deeply personal book—and it was revealing to me to see that one&#x27;s emotions don&#x27;t have to be set aside when writing, nor is it necessary for the kinds of feelings that mathematics evokes to be “translated” into more familiar ones.<p>(Edit: As an aside, Hofstadter&#x27;s translation of Pushkin&#x27;s <i>Eugene Onegin</i> is similarly self-indulgent, and a joy to read. Of course one ought to read a couple of other translations first and keep them nearby, to become familiar with the content, but in terms of sheer wordplay and outrageous rhymes, it tops anything.)

It feels <i>as if</i> the author had a powerful transformational psychedelic experience and afterwards he wrote the book to share what he learned about consciousness and its relationships with self-referential computation.<p>While it seems the crowd here is focused on the &quot;Gödel&quot; part, the book actually dives deep into a lot of auxiliary topics, for example (from memory having read it 20 years ago) - ideas about Zen, tensions between reductionism and holism, how DNA replicates itself, contrapuntal music etc. And while GEB isn&#x27;t necessarily a great introduction to these topics, the concepts are indeed related in some way towards the philosophical question of consciousness, and IMHO the reader benefits from having been introduced these concepts in such a context.<p>So if you&#x27;re just trying to understand Gödel&#x27;s theorem there are better books.

It wasn&#x27;t mine.<p>Not because I didn&#x27;t like it: I enjoyed it a lot, I learned things from it, it was one of my favourite books, etc. I still think it&#x27;s an impressive piece of work. But there was nothing particularly <i>ineffable</i> about it.<p>So let me try to summarize some of the perfectly effable things that people who like GEB tend to like about it, which might (or might not!) make it worth reading for you.<p>1. It&#x27;s a <i>playful</i> book. Hofstadter is having a lot of fun as he writes. (I think this is one of the things that people who don&#x27;t like the book tend to really dislike: if you don&#x27;t happen to enjoy the same things Hofstadter does, it can just feel self-indulgent.)<p>Here&#x27;s a fairly typical example of the sort of thing he does: the book alternates between ordinary chapters, where Hofstadter might explain some bit of mathematics or talk about an incident in the life of J S Bach or whatever, and dialogues between some imaginary characters. Each of those dialogues is named after a particular piece of music by J S Bach. For instance, one of them is called &quot;Crab Canon&quot;, after one of the little pieces in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Musical Offering&quot; which has the amusing property that it&#x27;s the same forwards as backwards. So Hofstadter&#x27;s dialogue is <i>also</i> the same forwards as backwards, and he&#x27;s constructed it so that the conversation makes a reasonable amount of sense both ways around.<p>That&#x27;s a fairly superficial sort of play -- it doesn&#x27;t have much to do with the deeper underlying ideas Hofstadter is trying to explore, it&#x27;s just a bit of fun. But he does play around with the deeper ideas too.<p>2. It brings a bunch of apparently different ideas together and relates them to one another. The &quot;psychedelic&quot; aspects may come from this -- there&#x27;s something of the &quot;wow, I never realised before, but everything is, like, one thing&quot; to it. And this is another thing that you might either really like -- he&#x27;s made a bunch of unobvious connections between things you mightn&#x27;t have seen links between, and connecting things better enriches your mind -- or really dislike, if you feel that the connections he&#x27;s claiming to make are bogus.<p>For instance, Hofstadter is very keen on what he calls &quot;strange loops&quot;, in which category he includes (1) indirect self-reference, as in the machinery of Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem or &quot;quining&quot; (copy this down, first without the quotes and then again, after a colon, with them: &quot;copy this down, first without the quotes and then again, after a colon, with them&quot;) and (2) what happens when a person thinks about their <i>self</i> and (3) Escher pictures like &quot;Print Gallery&quot; or &quot;Drawing Hands&quot; that somehow show something containing or creating a representation of itself and (4) the way in which DNA codes for proteins which make cells with machinery for converting DNA into proteins which etc. and (5) rather more tendentiously, one of Bach&#x27;s canons which ends a tone higher than it starts so that if you kept on playing it the key would keep rising and rising. The common theme is something about traversing levels of a hierarchy and somehow coming back to where you started. If you agree with Hofstadter that this is an interesting and important general phenomenon (he thinks it&#x27;s essential to how conscious minds work) and that all these diverse things are cases of it, then you&#x27;ll find this enlightening, maybe even exciting. If you think he&#x27;s just grouped together a bunch of things with little in common and convinced himself they&#x27;re all the same thing, then not.<p>3. It talks about some really quite exciting mathematics (at least, for those who are able to be excited by mathematics): Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. If you just want to learn about how Goedel&#x27;s stuff works, you can get that more efficiently and probably more clearly in other places. But Hofstadter&#x27;s explanation isn&#x27;t so bad, and he intertwines it with all those other things he&#x27;s interested in, and once again you might like it or hate it. In any case, for many people GEB was their first exposure to the idea that some statements that are just about the properties of the positive integers might be <i>provably neither provable nor disprovable</i>, and to the neat techniques Goedel cooked up by which, in some sense, statements about properties of positive integers can &quot;really&quot; be &quot;talking about&quot; mathematical statements and proofs and whatnot, and these are (again, for some subset of the population) exciting ideas.<p>4. Escher made some really cool pictures. Bach made some really cool music. If you happen not to be familiar with them before reading GEB, then being introduced to this cool stuff is a pretty valuable service GEB can do you.<p>5. Chunks of GEB are about artificial intelligence. The world of AI has changed a <i>lot</i> since GEB, of course, and today&#x27;s AI systems don&#x27;t have at all the sort of structure I think Hofstadter expected them to have. (It may be that they have some of that structure &quot;hidden inside&quot; -- artificial neural networks are mysterious and inscrutable in something like the same way as brains are -- but I think Hofstadter was expecting that structure to be in the <i>code</i>.) I haven&#x27;t read GEB in a while and won&#x27;t try to pronounce on how much value his thoughts-from-way-back-then have today. But I think one thing some people have found exciting about GEB, especially when reading it early in life, is that it was the first thing they read that took seriously the possibility that computers might be able to think in something like the same way as humans, and tried to think about how that might work. The ideas of AI are much more &quot;in the water supply&quot; these days; I doubt anyone will first hear about them from reading GEB any more.<p>6. (Same theme as 3, 4, 5.) There are just lots of interesting things in GEB. Zen koans. Fractals. Winograd&#x27;s &quot;SHRDLU&quot; AI system. Bacteriophages. Non-euclidean geometry. Srinivasa Ramanujan. Etc. You won&#x27;t learn <i>much</i> about any of these things from GEB, but encountering them at all is delightful if one happens not to have seen them before. So the experience of reading the book, if one happens not already to know everything, is one where at any moment you may suddenly encounter some fascinating new thing.<p>I am not claiming that you should read GEB. It&#x27;s pretty long. All the individual things you could learn from it, you could learn another way. If you&#x27;re a generally-well-informed adult, you probably already know a lot of the things some people first encounter in GEB. You might not share Hofstadter&#x27;s taste in wordplay and the like. But it definitely has <i>merits that can be described</i>.</div><br/><div id="39256803" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39256803" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FabHK</span><span>|</span><a href="#39254900">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39255842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39255399">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39256803">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39256803">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow, this is a great explainer.

I myself failed to get past the ~100 page mark (he went in depth explaining topics that I was already familiar with from other sources, which bored me. And I didn&#x27;t really find the connections to art and music that insightful or interesting - but maybe I&#x27;m just too uptight). My understanding from skimming the book and reading some of Hofstadter&#x27;s other works (including his response to Searle&#x27;s &quot;Minds, brains and programs&quot; article) is that the book is trying to establish how complexity can emerge in systems with many simple moving parts via recursion (or something like that) in different scenarios, suggesting that this is how consciousness emerges from a complex web of neurons (the brain).<p>This seems a little wishy-washy to me. I don&#x27;t see this as a good counterargument against Searle&#x27;s argument that syntaxx alone is not enough to give rise to semantics. (I find Dennett&#x27;s argument about intuition pumps a more convincing counterargument.) Maybe my understanding of Hofstadter&#x27;s argument is too simplistic - I&#x27;m happy to be educated (I wasn&#x27;t able to make it through even half of GEB after all).<p>And of course, that&#x27;s not to say that GEB isn&#x27;t a valuable book - it seems like most readers really enjoy it and learn a lot, even if they don&#x27;t much care for the ultimate cognitive science&#x2F;philosophy of mind position Hofstadter is trying to defend.</div><br/><div id="39254190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39254190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">The_Colonel</span><span>|</span><a href="#39254122">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39253885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39254190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39254190">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; it seems like most readers really enjoy it and learn a lot,<p>I think it&#x27;s one of those books which most people actually don&#x27;t enjoy that much, but don&#x27;t want to admit it, because it has such an intellectual aura around it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39253885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39253885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leto_ii</span><span>|</span><a href="#39254122">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39255125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39253885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39253885">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">GEB is one of the books that as an adult I have learned to not care about anymore.

So, so true. And Hegel in turn was just adapting Kant, despite calling him a “blockhead” in the preface (hilarious, can’t even imagine what 1800s German for “blockhead” is). It’s absolutely Hegelian. To make it more explicit for the HN audience:<p>Hegel wrote a very famous book called the “The Experience of Mind” (or, in obnoxious philosophy language, “The phenomenology of Spirit”). In it, he details how he thinks the mind is made up of successive levels of distinct programs, each of which builds on what came for it in a very specific way he calls “dialectic synthesis”. In this way he goes through all the perceived capabilities of the mind (the big four in order roughly being sensation, understanding, awareness, and reason) and ties them to specific steps in this synthetic chain.<p>I hope it’s obvious from that how this argument mimics GEB (which I understand as roughly “the human mind is a collection of looping programs with these characteristics”).</div><br/><div id="39257022" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39257022" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#39255125">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39255461">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39256300">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39257022">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39257022">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; which I understand as roughly “the human mind is a collection of looping programs with these characteristics”<p>uh ... the center of Hofstadter&#x27;s worldview, which he re-enunciated later in &quot;I am a strange loop&quot; is almost precisely the opposite of Hegel&#x27;s persepective. Hofstadter came to see the idea of &quot;heterarchical systems&quot; as central to creativity and, in his opinion, consciousness. These systems are precisely <i>not</i> what Hegel describes, with &quot;each level building on what came before it&quot;, but instead the levels are functionally and physically entangled so that &quot;higher level&quot; ones can intimately and profoundly impact &quot;lower level&quot; ones and vice versa.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39256300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39256300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rongenre</span><span>|</span><a href="#39255125">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39256300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39256300">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">PDF of GEB: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;GEBen_201404" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;GEBen_201404</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39254111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39254111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dave1010uk</span><span>|</span><a href="#39256300">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39253815">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39254111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39254111">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  I had a secondary goal in the back of my head... if you have a copy of GEB on your shelf collecting dust and you&#x27;ve never read more than a chapter or two, dust it off and see how it goes this time.<p>Dusted it off and after only a few pages, it&#x27;s already a completely different read to when I read (a fraction of) it a decade or so ago.</div><br/><div id="39256336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39256336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">peterashford</span><span>|</span><a href="#39254111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39253815">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39256336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39256336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m interested to know: How so?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39253815" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39253815" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">swozey</span><span>|</span><a href="#39254111">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39254889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39253815">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39253815">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I bought this when I was like 19 and going through some &quot;i&#x27;m going to be a physicist&quot; mental break and obsessing over michio kaku and wild theories and it made absolutely no sense to me at all.

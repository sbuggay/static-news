Every industrialized nation is going through the same phenomenon and not all of them are having housing crises. It&#x27;s a combination of various associated costs to raising children (housing, early childcare, food, schooling, extracurriculars, hobbies, etc.) that have risen faster than most people&#x27;s wages. The nuclear family model also significantly diminished the role of parents and other senior relatives in early childcare which would&#x27;ve created significant savings in terms of both time and money.<p>Also, living without children or even a partner at all has become significantly more viable in the past 40+ years or so. It wasn&#x27;t until 1974 when women in the United States could unconditionally open bank accounts out of their free will: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act</a>. To not marry and have children would&#x27;ve practically been a form of ostracization. So many people, especially women, &quot;settled&quot; into marriage and family life simply because there was no other option. I think the decline in birth rates is a fair tradeoff to forcing fewer people into a lifestyle they did not want which would inevitably result in broken families and broken kids. What society needs to figure out is how to decouple productivity from raw human headcount, as well as how to avert potential humanitarian disasters that may occur when the decoupling happens.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39341855" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39341855" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caturopath</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341399">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342416">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342842">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39341855">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39341855">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is very confused.

Though it has certainly become a more normal trend in developed and developing countries than those with a higher level of poverty and poor.<p>I still contend however that it has never been easy. My grandparents had four children starting at age 20. My grandfather&#x27;s first job was sweeping floors in a factory at age 13, making $0.30 an hour. When he asked for a raise, he was fired. He said he didn&#x27;t have two nickels to rub between his fingers.<p>His father before him went into World War 1 at 15 years old. And <i>his</i> father (my great-great grandfather) falsely signed the documents affirming that he was 18 years old, to allow his own 15 year old son to go to war.<p>They struggled, but didn&#x27;t complain. Some part of it is cultural expectation, and that has changed greatly over time. In spite of all odds my grandparents raised four fairly middle class children in these circumstances, but had a good few decades of strife. Whether or not they would create a family and procreate was taken for granted. It was assumed, at their own economic expense. But long-term family wise, today my grandfather has a tree of descendants who love him.<p>I think today we are more conscious of the economic equation. We ask whether or not we can afford to provide for children, rather than letting them exist and then asking how we can provide for them. There is an aspect of this that I appreciate, but I worry that it&#x27;s mixed with some amount of narcissism. Though I am an atheist, there is some unreason to our existence in the first place, and there is hope in the continuance of ourselves that we should value beyond economics. There is a romance and some type of spiritual value in being able to put aside the cost-benefit analysis and simply bear new life that is part you, to have and to hold, to love, teach, and reciprocally learn from.<p>We have so much bounty today that the idea of &quot;sacrificing&quot; ourselves for something that only has potential value is an alien concept. As our material wealth has increased, and as our understanding of personal economy has evolved, I think we&#x27;ve lost a bit of our primal, but beautiful, nature that wants ourselves to persist at a biological, cosmic level.<p>You, here, right now reading this are the absolute last leaf, the most extended branch, the most outstretched and sun-bleached arm of a tree of life that has been proceeding for four billion years. You are the last link in a chain that has not been broken for <i>four billion years</i>. Can you believe that? Every time I consider that, I think of my parents. And I ask, who am I to be so conceited that all of that history, that fourth of a fraction of the universe, should end with me?<p>I&#x27;m not sure where I&#x27;m going with this, and, I will confess that I got a little tipsy for the super bowl. Don&#x27;t judge me too harshly. But life is beautiful, and beauty is always difficult to sustain. We do it because beauty contains a truth and a promise for the future. And I think that&#x27;s something we need to put effort into re-evaluating, and re-valuing, in our current world.<p>One line of inquiry might be why there is a correlation between bounty and the general wealth of an economy, and the fertility rate. Many parts of the world that are poorer are more fertile, and reproduce more unquestionably. Korea is rich and the rate is 0.84. In the Congo the rate is 6.21. It is not about economics. And if you counter that it is about poor education or care, I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the reason either. It&#x27;s culture, and values.<p>Paul Revere had 15 children. 5 of them died young, and he still had 10. He had a horse and a rifle and a small wooden house you can still tour in Boston. Today we have DINKs, and people who are in what is considered to be the low-income range with multiple rooms in big cities, an education, and combustion-engine vehicles who say it&#x27;s too expensive to have children. Maybe your tastes are too expensive. Maybe you&#x27;ve been raised softly, and don&#x27;t know how to set yourself aside to rear and participate in a family that is spiritually worth more than just yourself.<p>One of the other comments said I ranted so I thought I&#x27;d actually provide one.

I always wondered if having kids is just so that somebody finally listens to you at an age where your peers really only listen if they&#x27;re deep friends, or if you actually have something actually exceptional to say. Sure you get to relive childhood, and then again when you have grandchildren. You don&#x27;t get these two things if you don&#x27;t have children, but they&#x27;re not that deep, you can e.g. teach to actually intelligent peers, or relive childhood curiosity in better ways.

Every generation&#x27;s (~20 years) size is (fertility_rate &#x2F; 2) times as large as the one prior that gave birth to them. So after 5 generations (~1 century), a fertility rate of 1.9 would see the next generation&#x27;s size go from 100 to 77 (100 * (1.9&#x2F;2)^5). A fertility rate of 1.5 would go from 100 to 23.

You can add the entire Arab World, Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia as having sustainable fertility rates.<p>You can use metrics from different groups and slice and dice sections and find ways of getting above 2.1 (replacement), sure, but it&#x27;s not affecting my main point at all, which was that it&#x27;s not contained to the Western world, and that 3 kids is now an outlier in most of the world.<p>To your specifics:<p>South Asia is listed as 2.2. But India has hit 2.1 and is declining, and Bangladesh and Nepal are even further below replacement  - the World Bank metric is I presume buoyed by Pakistan, which has hit 3.1 (3.47 in the 2021 numbers on Wiipedia), and is declining, and Afghanistan, which is in even steeper decline - the other countries in the region are mostly rounding errors in terms of population.<p>It&#x27;s a difference of whether it&#x27;s already hit replacement as a region already, or will within 2-3 years at most. I&#x27;m perfectly happy to accept the World Bank numbers for the sake of this argument, as it&#x27;s not relevant to the argument.<p>With respect to MENA and the Arab World, you&#x27;re double-counting. The bulk of the countries that are part of the Arab World vs Middle East &#x2F;North Africa are the same.<p>The largest non-Arab MENA countries are Iran, which is well below replacement (1.7) and Turkey, at 1.9.<p>The Arab World also includes several countries considered sub-Sarahan by some or all of other groups (Somalia, Mauritania, Sudan) which pulls it up, and MENA curiously includes Sudan in some statistics, even though it&#x27;s considered sub-Saharan and&#x2F;or East Africa by other groupings.<p>Once you actually exclude the sub-Saharan countries from those groups, the rate lowers significantly. Taking Sudan alone out of MENA brings MENA close to replacement. If you choose to look at the Arab World alone, then, sure, even excluding the sub-Saharan countries they&#x27;re still above replacement. I&#x27;m again, fine with choosing to slice the numbers that way - they do not affect the argument I was making in any meaningful way, because then the remaining MENA countries are below instead.<p>What we&#x27;re left with no matter how we slice it, is that roughly half the worlds countries are below replacement, accounting for well above half the worlds current population (but that balance will shift rapidly), and leaving the world average at ~2.3 and declining even by World Bank numbers.<p>&gt; And places like Latin America are in decline, but still in the realm of realm of being saved at ~1.9.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;being saved&quot; here. Short of economic collapse, we don&#x27;t know of any reliable measure to drive these numbers back up again, and they&#x27;ve been consistently trending down since the 1960&#x27;s. China appears to be poised to be the country likely go hardest in trying, now recommending 3 children per family, and given an extremely restrictive immigration policy. That&#x27;s fine - they don&#x27;t need to be &quot;saved&quot;.<p>&gt; The only places currently in catastrophic collapse at the EU (1.5), North America (1.6), and East Asia (1.5).<p>I was not, and is not, and will not be, arguing any &quot;catastrophic collapse&quot; - to me at least that notion is meaningless to most people other than &quot;great replacement&quot; type people.<p>The world as a whole is headed for a relatively gentle flattening of population growth, and a period of decline, but no &quot;catastrophic collapse&quot; in population. But we <i>are</i> headed for a fairly dramatic shift in politics and economic development as this happens and the countries facing the steepest drops become more dependent on actually courting immigration as a consequence. There will still be <i>enough</i> growth to do that for decades to come.</div><br/><div id="39342855" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342855" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342448">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342829">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342855">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342855">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &quot;The world as a whole is headed for a relatively gentle flattening of population growth&quot;<p>You know something that&#x27;s really weird to think about? In 1950 Africa&#x27;s population was 227m! [1] The US at the time had about 160m, nearly as many people as the entire African continent! Fertility rates are hard to intuit because they&#x27;re not only exponential, but systems where the effect is delayed from the cause by several decades, but then once it starts - it starts rocketing off uncontrollably, be that in loss or gain of population.<p>The world&#x27;s population may start to level off at some point, but sub-replacement rates will cause Western nations to start losing population at an exponential rate. It will be the equal but opposite of what happened to Africa over the past century. And this doesn&#x27;t level out or even slow down, except when people start having children again. So for instance many people know Japan now has &gt; 10% of its population over 80, but I think a lot of us have this sort of concept that <i>&#x27;Well sure, but as they start to die off - then things will probably start to look a bit more sane.&#x27;</i><p>In reality, it&#x27;s the exact opposite. As this group dies off, they&#x27;re going to be replaced by an even larger group of 80+ year olds, leaving Japan in an even worse state, as one can immediately see just glancing at Japan&#x27;s population pyramid. [2] Right now Japan&#x27;s losing about 1 in 200 people per year, and this will never stop until either they go extinct or they start having children again. And it will actually get substantially worse until they hit their &#x27;fertility equilibrium point&#x27; where all living generations have&#x2F;had comparable fertility rates (picture the sides of the population pyramid having a constant slope). And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s waiting for the entirety of the Western world, if we don&#x27;t turn things around.<p>And this is also likely a vicious cycle because as age ratios and demographics get all screwed up, economies will start to collapse, which will make it even more uncomfortable to have children.<p>---<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;world-population&#x2F;africa-population&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;world-population&#x2F;africa-popula...</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demographics_of_Japan#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Japan_Population_Pyramid.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demographics_of_Japan#&#x2F;media&#x2F;F...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39342829" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342829" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Rapzid</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342448">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342855">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341413">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342829">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342829">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>South Korea has entered the chat..</i><p>Seriously, it&#x27;s wild visiting South Korea and having a tour guide jokingly beg people to immigrate and make babies.<p>#JokingNotJoking</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39341413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39341413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dalyons</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341363">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341623">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342279">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39341413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39341413">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, nevermind the most expensive housing, education and healthcare ever, even in inflation adjusted terms.

But if what it took to have more kids was to go back to that, I wouldn&#x27;t.<p>The commenter above can call that soft all they want - I don&#x27;t feel bad for wanting to enjoy life more than I want more children (I have one son; I might well have another child, but because I&#x27;m at a stage where my girlfriend and I can afford it <i>without</i> sacrificing our standard of living and that does place me in a privileged position)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39341612" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39341612" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ekianjo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341502">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341701">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341659">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39341612">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39341612">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">more expensive than when? people had nothing 150 years ago and still had kids, mind you</div><br/><div id="39341687" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39341687" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dalyons</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341659">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39341687">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39341687">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes they, and especially women, had absolutely no choice due to lack of birth control and various repressions.

If you&#x27;re not working backwards from an accidental pregnancy, you just have to consider the volatility of your life, and the prospects for the future. My dad had me when he was 21, accidentally, in a time not so long ago where various alternatives weren&#x27;t super available, and made it work (horribly) until they divorced, in one of the poorest and most isolated cities in Canada. He has however managed to work the same job for 30 years, and bought a house (with help from both sets of grandparents financially. Now, he does have the house, but he&#x27;s had more kids in that time, and still works at the same company, but doesn&#x27;t make enough to keep anything for later; it all goes to childcare and life.<p>In order to make something of what was an incredibly volatile childhood and an interest in computers, I eventually moved to a much more appealing and more expensive but larger pond that I could pay for at the time; my hometown just didn&#x27;t really have a market. I&#x27;m also 31 now, nearly 32, and have only managed to bring in an income for a maximum of a year and a half since 18, have ended up without a stable housing situation for quite some time, and that&#x27;s really difficult to pivot from if you consider that the bet you made on the thing you were capable of, just hasn&#x27;t really panned out (frontend development apparently). What&#x27;s next now that that the hypothetical prospects I&#x27;d have had in previous years have functionally evaporated? I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;ll pay for this basement apartment and drain my savings as I figure it out, going into my second year with no job of any kind.<p>Ironically, the people who got into trades that they had no prior knowledge of, and that didn&#x27;t pursue the ambition to explore beyond the confines of their hometown, have the most stability. Me the idiot picked the computer thing and nobody taught me how to be sufficiently obedient or whatever.<p>So although I&#x27;ve been in positions where my salary was relatively higher than I could have ever imagined as a kid, I&#x27;ve always known it was going to disappear the next year in a layoff or a firing or a pandemic, and prospects for the future would always be just tenuous enough to barely be able to get by on my own or even with a partner. I don&#x27;t take out debt, and all my money which stays liquid eventually goes to rent. I&#x27;m always in risk mitigation mode, because there&#x27;s always been risk, and although I&#x27;ve never been compelled to have kids, some amount of that is predicated on the knowledge that it doesn&#x27;t seem right to bring a kid up if I can&#x27;t even figure out how to hold a job for 2 damn years.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39342023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stkdump</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341055">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342518">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342023">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Anecdata from Germany checking in: I have 2 kindergarden aged kids.

When markets are <i>contracting</i>, your incentive becomes to grab as much of the pie now before it shrinks.  This tends to make firms...well, militant.  The incentive to cooperate only appears when people weight the future more than the present, giving value to future interactions; otherwise, the incentive is to kill off your rivals, take their stuff, and hide the bodies.  Thus, during a contraction and in times of scarcity people tend to become raiders, scavengers, and conquerors.<p>To protect themselves against raiders, scavengers, and conquerors, people tend to band together into larger groups.  Thus a hierarchy emerges - weaker groups pledge fealty to stronger ones, which in turn protect them from other strong groups that have not pledged fealty, and so on.  Usually you get war in the meantime, but feudalism is the peace treaty that arises out of that.<p>Interestingly this dynamic tends to play out <i>within</i> the capitalist system.  When an industry reaches maturity, usually there&#x27;s a shakeout with a price war where many of the weaker companies go bankrupt, and then the savvier-but-weaker get bought up by the bigger ones, and so on until you have a few megacorps with hierarchical organization.  The purpose of managerial capitalism is as much to defend firms against competition as it is to increase efficiency.

Others will object to the fact that the biggest benefit is going to be for the middle and upper classes – who are most likely to pay the higher tax rates – while having far less benefit for those on low incomes, who pay little or no tax already. There is the (difficult to quantify) risk that unsuitable parents may end up having kids just for the tax benefits, and then mistreat&#x2F;abuse those kids.

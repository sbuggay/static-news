I haven&#x27;t had the time or energy during the holidays to deal with it, so now I&#x27;m dealing with increased hunger from going cold turkey off these things all because of bullshit micromanagement from shitty insurance companies on the market place.<p>If this makes it better and easier for companies to actually pay out for this I am 100% for it, there should not be a constant jerking about for what is or isn&#x27;t paid.  Also - this wasn&#x27;t for weightloss (which I assume would have been Wegovy approved), this was for diabetes, and it was under control with Rybelsus, and I assume Ozempic, though we were still in the process of building up to it (I was on max dose of Rybelsus and I&#x27;m pretty sure I needed the max Ozempic as well).

Then the government insurance declares the maximum price they&#x27;ll pay. Is there any meaningful way to distinguish this from price controls? The vast majority of customers can&#x27;t afford the drug without insurance and the government is the insurance company and is setting the price through regulation.<p>In particular, notice that this has all of the <i>problems</i> of price controls. There is no real market to enable price discovery, no effective way for customers to switch insurers and thereby punish insurers who pay too much and have high premiums or pay too little and have poor coverage, it&#x27;s just regulators making up a number and saying take it or leave it.<p>And even at that, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem for generic drugs because then the insurance can just put it out for bids and still have price discovery (i.e. a lowest bidder).

The real kicker is that for some brands&#x2F;doses the price doesn&#x27;t vary whether you get more or less of the drug - so people end up asking to for a prescription to the highest dose off-label and then split the dose themselves.<p>For example, you can click the auto-injector pen a fewer number of clicks to measure out a smaller dose than what is normally injected by the pen, then relatively safely save it in the fridge for longer than recommended even without preservatives (some pens have and some don&#x27;t).<p>It&#x27;s frustrating when pricing decisions are made assuming insurance benefits and yet insurance isn&#x27;t always available, e.g. unemployment.

Also, if you put 5000 calories worth of food inside of you, but then immediately vomit out 4500 of those calories, you&#x27;ve only really consumed 500 calories. You <i>can</i> overwhelm the system.<p>If you can restrict yourself to consuming at a caloric deficit, you <i>will</i> lose weight.<p>That&#x27;s difficult however. Because if you pick a target calorie amount, you will see less progress as you lose weight. Because of math. 1500 is half of 3000, but only a quarter of 2000. People get fixated on 2000, as if we operate based on 2000 calories a day. But if you were previously consuming 3000 calories a day, your weight requires 3000 calories a day. So when you drop to 1500, you are going to lose about a pound every two days for a while. When you get to about 2500 maintenance calories&#x2F;day, you&#x27;re going to slow down to a about pound every three days. This is not your metabolism &quot;adjusting&quot;. You weigh less, it takes fewer calories to maintain that weight.<p>And you <i>will</i> be hungry. It <i>will</i> suck. And you have to be meticulous in your record keeping. There are no &quot;free&quot; calories.<p>And we&#x27;re not even getting into the mental component of all of this. What&#x27;s been termed as &quot;food noise&quot;. And it&#x27;s one of the things that people on Ozempic and the like notice the most, they stop thinking about food. And food addiction is one of the absolute worst addictions to have. Hands down. With just about every other addiction, abstinence is an option. Alcohol, gambling, heroin, cocaine, meth, etc, none of that is necessary to live. We need food. We need to eat. You cannot avoid food. You have to actually develop discipline. Teetotalers do not have discipline. They avoid the issue altogether.<p>So CICO works, but it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to do for lots of reasons that are not related to the biology or physics of it.</div><br/><div id="42744432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42744432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulpauper</span><span>|</span><a href="#42741413">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742328">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742855">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42744432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42744432">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup, and where this stall vs. weight occurs is mediated by genes to a large extent.

Humans have, for at least the last several million years, been taught <i>in the evolutionary sense</i> to never let a calorie go uneaten. Too many famines. &quot;Just don&#x27;t do that thing that every gene in your body screams at you to do, and feel miserable for it&quot; isn&#x27;t really good advice, and isn&#x27;t all that insightful. One can&#x27;t even necessarily make judgements about how many calories they themselves can eat based on what they see other people around them eating. &quot;That other person stays skinny, and I&#x27;m eating about the same amount as them&quot; is not an on-the-surface unreasonable assumption... but it doesn&#x27;t work, even if you could eliminate human misperceptions.<p>&gt;At one point, I had a podcast-obsessed coworker who tried to tell us all that even when he ate 1000 calories per day he couldn&#x27;t lose weight. He had a long list of influencers and podcasters who supported this claim.<p>The week after Thanksgiving, I had a heart attack (age 50). I was in the CICU for nearly a week before they let me go home. On the day I was released, they sent a nutritionist in to tell me that I shouldn&#x27;t try to eat one meal a day, that I really needed to be eating 3 meals a day, and to eat bread at least for two of those (or other carbs). Don&#x27;t eat butter, eat margarine though. Yadda yadda. This was what, 8 weeks ago? Not 1962 in any event.<p>Do you know what 1000 calories looks like spread across 3 meals? Or how long you have to run on a treadmill to make up 300 calories if you bump that up to 1300? Or that, even sitting in an office chair every day, I can&#x27;t lose weight (of any significance) at caloric intake much above that? I&#x27;m willing to concede that any problems I&#x27;m having here are in my own head, that I can&#x27;t change my behavior or habits or whatever (to literally save my own life), but this isn&#x27;t the sort of problem that can be handled by any but the most godlike of willpowers (which I do not have, if that doesn&#x27;t go without saying). Right now, I probably need to be eating just one meal every other day, as I&#x27;m not really gaining any weight back but I&#x27;m not losing much either. My meal, such as it is, is a salad that fits in a small bowl (less than 2 cups of lettuce and uncooked vegetables). None of this is helped by knowing that people who are so-called medical professionals are giving me is absolute horseshit.<p>The truth of the matter is that we are adapted to eat only once every few days, and for even that meal to be meager and less than appetizing. But we live in a world that has mastered abundance and flavor, and uses marketing science to constantly try to get us to to buy all that. When you tell people &quot;just eat less&quot;, really you&#x27;re just doing the r&#x2F;fatpeoplehate but in a covert way where you don&#x27;t have to feel like an asshole. We (all of us, sympathizers, haters, acceptance activists) turn this into a morality tale, and can&#x27;t think about this rationally. For anyone that cares, I wear 33&quot; jeans, but I probably need to drop another 20-25lbs realistically.<p>PS Just giggled thinking about what it would mean to the US economy if suddenly every adult over the age of 28 started eating one small meal every 2-3 days... even our stock market is arrayed against us.</div><br/><div id="42746596" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42746596" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Noumenon72</span><span>|</span><a href="#42741413">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42742855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42744473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42746596">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42746596">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It makes no sense that a mammal that needs to keep 150 pounds of tissue at 98.6 degrees could do so on so many fewer calories than dogs and chimps.

But to me, willpower does feel like a trainable thing. Doing hard things seems to make me better at doing other hard things. Limiting my TV makes me less likely to compulsively eat later. Working out hard makes me less likely to lie in bed scrolling on my phone. Doing hard coursework makes me more focused at work.<p>The caveat is that these changes seem to happen pretty gradually, and the gains can be lost pretty easily, just like with muscle.<p>But being in a perpetual caloric deficit can be pretty rough and can definitely sap your energy.

center on the emperors Vitellius and Claudius who were notorious for
their binge eating and purging practices. Historian Suetonius writes
that “Above all, however, he [Vitellius] was … always having at least
three feasts, sometimes four in a day — breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a
drinking party — and easily finding capacity for it all through regular
vomiting” (Suetonius, Vit, 13) [1]. Similarly, the emperor Claudius was
infamous for never leaving a meal until overfed, after which a feather
was placed in his throat to stimulate his gag reflex (Suetonius, Claud, 33) [2].
In his writing, Suetonius takes on a disapproving tone when describing
the eating habits of Claudius and Vitellius, as highlighted by the use of
words such as “luxury,” “cruelty,” and “stuffed”(Crichton, 204). This tone
indicates that although binge eating and purging were accepted, albeit

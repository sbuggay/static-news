This one has drummed up a bit of interest due to its (relatively) high chance of impact. I actually spent quite a bit of time yesterday digging through archive images trying trying to see if it was spotted on some previous times it came by the Earth (no luck unfortunately). Since we saw it so briefly, our knowledge of its orbit is not that great, and running the clock back to 2016 for example ended up with a large chunk of sky where it could have been, and it is quite small. We will almost certainly see it again with NEO Surveyor years before its 2032 close encounter. I have not run a simulation for it, but I would not be surprised if LSST (a large ground telescope survey which is currently coming online) to catch it around the same time NEO Surveyor does.<p>Our knowledge of the diameter of this object is a bit fuzzy, because of surface reflectivity, small shiny things can appear as bright as dark large things. This is one of the motivations of making the NEO Surveyor an IR telescope, since IR we see black body emission off of the objects, which is mostly size dependent, and only weakly albedo dependent.<p>There is an even tinier chance that if it misses the Earth in 2032, it could hit the moon. I haven&#x27;t run the numbers precisely for that one, but it impacted a few times in some monte-carlo simulations.<p>If anyone is interested in orbit dynamics, I have open sourced some of the engine we are using for observation predictions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Caltech-IPAC&#x2F;kete">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Caltech-IPAC&#x2F;kete</a><p>It is relatively high precision, though JPL Horizons has more accurate gravitational models and is far better suited for impact studies. My code is primarily for predicting when objects will be seen in telescopes.</div><br/><div id="42871271" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42871271" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slackerIII</span><span>|</span><a href="#42867550">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42876105">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42871271">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42871271">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great post, thank you!<p>Where does the uncertainty (1%) come from?

That distance has to be solved by basically doing a sort of triangulation, which requires either the observer or the object to move enough.
So if you observe over a short time (hours for example), you can see it is moving, but it is hard to tell distance.<p>Once you have an estimated orbit, if it has any interactions with planets (IE: flyby of Earth), small differences in positions during the close encounter make LARGE differences decades later. Add to this the effects of photons from the sun pushing on the smaller asteroids or dust, or out-gassing &#x2F;dust from comets cause these objects to slightly drift from just the basic gravitational forces. Generally inner solar system asteroids (inside mars) are very chaotic over hundreds of years, though typically predictable less than a century.<p>Note that I am not an expert on impact calculations, I just know a bit about and and can do back of the envelope ones.
There are a number of ways to get to the ~1%, the orbit fits have uncertainties on them and those can be propagated forward in time. However there are all sorts of complexities with doing that, and often the easiest method is to sample the uncertainty region a few hundred thousand times (Monte-carlo), and propagate those and see what hits.</div><br/><div id="42874741" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42874741" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coderenegade</span><span>|</span><a href="#42867550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42873468">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42871838">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42874741">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42874741">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very cool.

This imperfect knowledge is characterised by a probability distribution. Similarly the state of all other objects in the solar system is only known up to some distribution. To propagate the information forward in time to impact requires a complicated function f(state of solar system; state of asteroid). If all of the data was known (and expressible numerically) with perfect accuracy, and f were computable with perfect accuracy then all would be good. But as noted, (state of solar system; state of asteroid) is a probability distribution, and there are very few distributions and very few types of maps f that are amenable to analytic transformation. For example if the state was a normal distribution with mean x and covariance P, and f were a linear transformation, then x,P mapped through f is also normally distributed with mean y and covariance P_y, you can get the mean of the transform as y=fx, and P_y = fPf&#x27; (where &#x27; indicates transpose). Needless to say our knowledge of the state of the asteroid and the solar system is probably a rather complicated distribution, and the n-body problem is not a linear transformation. Monte-carlo simulation is often used to propagate probability distributions through non-linear transformations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42873111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42873111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">basementcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#42867550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42872244">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42876150">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42873276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42873111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42873111">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The observations are not 100% certain.

In principle, the object is gravitationally interacting with everything else in the solar system. But for the most part, most interactions are negligible and could be ignored (eg, other small objects far away), except of the large bodies. But there are many unknowns (as stated before), where initial conditions will affect the outcome of the trajectory simulation, and errors will certainly amplify over time.

I wonder how that affects objects such as this one if they pass through the Moon&#x27;s gravitational well.</div><br/><div id="42873919" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42873919" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SR2Z</span><span>|</span><a href="#42867550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42873749">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42875617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42873919">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42873919">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Clicking the link, I found this visualization of the approximate orbit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssd.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;tools&#x2F;sbdb_lookup.html#&#x2F;?sstr=2024%20YR4&amp;view=VOP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssd.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;tools&#x2F;sbdb_lookup.html#&#x2F;?sstr=2024%...</a><p>This orbit is around the sun (as asteroids tend to) and the apoapsis is closer to Jupiter&#x27;s orbit than Mars.</div><br/><div id="42874423" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42874423" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pclmulqdq</span><span>|</span><a href="#42867550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42873919">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42875617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42874423">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42874423">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, the gravity of asteroids or small planetary bodies like moons that it passes close to will have some small effects that can add up over a long time period.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42875617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42875617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">baq</span><span>|</span><a href="#42867550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42873749">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42873919">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42874813">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42875617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42875617">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gravity has unlimited range, the patched conics method you think of is a good approximation on short time spans, but breaks down surprisingly quickly.

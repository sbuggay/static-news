At this time, the Earth was believed to be relatively young (on the order of millions of years) because simple calculations would show that even a very high initial temperature would have cooled to at most the surface temperature within that time. What they missed was the internal heat budget of the planet, which we now know is driven by radioactivity (which, in 1907, had just been discovered - the Curies had shared a Nobel for it in 1903).<p>Wallace was right that this is a very small contributor to Earth&#x27;s surface temperature, but the false assumption that the planet had dramatically cooled was behind the idea that continental shapes and faulting were due to the movement of a cooling and thus contracting planet. Plate tectonics was a few years away from even being proposed as a serious theory at this point, and it wouldn&#x27;t gain much traction for another fifty years after that. But it turns out that tectonics is responsible for a lot of the geographic differences between the three bodies under discussion here. Earth has plate tectonics today, Mars probably did early in its history but does not today, and the Moon never did.<p>Yet despite being totally wrong about this, Wallace is <i>correct</i> (as best we currently understand it) that the Martian valleys are indeed fault lines. He comes around to it from a totally wrong direction: that Mars, being smaller than the Earth, began with less heat, and that its interior solidified first, causing its surface to contract onto that rigid surface and crack in a way Earth&#x27;s did not.<p>There&#x27;s a lesson here in the ability to form consistent, empirical, <i>wrong</i> theories given even slightly wrong inputs.</div><br/><div id="41014838" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41014838" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brabel</span><span>|</span><a href="#41014461">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40995000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41014838">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41014838">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There&#x27;s a lesson here in the ability to form consistent, empirical, wrong theories given even slightly wrong inputs.<p>Is this really a lesson? Every single theory evolved this way, starting with an almost certainly naive hypothesis, then with incomplete evidence leading to bad conclusions, then as better data came in, adjustments to the theory until we had something that fit the evidence to a high degree (though it&#x27;s almost always possible further adjustments are necessary even when it looks like we&#x27;ve found the perfect theory: e.g. Newton physics VS relativity).<p>I think you would be hard pressed to find any theory that did NOT evolve in this exact manner.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40995000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40995000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bkjshki</span><span>|</span><a href="#41014461">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41014318">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40995000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40995000">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s fascinating to dive into Wallace&#x27;s 1907 take on Mars&#x27;s habitability, especially given how much our understanding of space has evolved since then. Wallace was ahead of his time, applying rigorous scientific thought to what was then pure speculation. He approached the question with the same analytical rigor he used in his biogeographical studies, dismissing the notion of Martian canals and intelligent life with well-reasoned arguments. Fast forward to today, with missions like Perseverance, we&#x27;re still exploring the same fundamental question but with vastly more sophisticated tools. It&#x27;s a testament to how some scientific questions remain timeless. What&#x27;s your take on how Wallace&#x27;s perspective holds up against current Mars research?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41014318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41014318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempodox</span><span>|</span><a href="#40995000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41014123">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41014318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41014318">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A commendable effort to preserve history.<p>Chapter VI has an irritating equation that claims the fourth root of one-hundredth equals one-sixth.

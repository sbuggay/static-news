All thru my CS education I was writing tons of toy programs, contributing (as much as I could) toward OSS, reading lots of stuff on best practices, and leaning on my much older (12 years) brother who was working in the industry. He pointed me to Java and IntelliJ, told me to read Design Patterns (Gang of Four) and Refactoring (Fowler). I read Joel on Software religiously, even though he was a Microsoft guy and I was a hardcore Linux-head.<p>By the time I joined my first real company at age 21, I was ready to start putting a lot of this stuff into place. I joined a small med device software company which had a great product but really no strong software engineering culture: zero unit tests, using CVS with no branches, release builds were done manually on the COO&#x27;s workstation, etc.<p>As literally the most junior person in the company I worked through all these things and convinced my much more senior colleagues that we should start using release branches instead of &quot;hey everybody, please don&#x27;t check in any new code until we get this release out the door&quot;. I wrote automated build scripts mostly for my own benefit, until the COO realized that he didn&#x27;t have to worry about keeping a dev environment on his machine, now that he didn&#x27;t code any more. I wrote a junit-inspired unit testing framework for the language we were using (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IDL_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IDL_(programming_language)</a> - like Matlab but weirder).<p>Without my work as a &quot;10x junior engineer&quot;, the company would have been unable to scale to more than 3 or 4 developers.

Read &quot;The Mythical Man Month.&quot; That&#x27;s the book that popularized the concept that some developers were 5-25x faster than others. One of the takeaways was that the speed of a developer was not correlated with experience. At all.<p>That said, the kind of person who can learn programming at 12 might just be the kind of person who is really good at programming.<p>I started learning programming concepts at 11-12. I&#x27;m not the best programmer I know, but when I started out in the industry at 22 I was working with developers with 10+ years of (real) experience on me...and I was able to come in and improve on their code to an extreme degree. I was completing my projects faster than other senior developers. With less than two years of experience in the industry I was promoted to &quot;senior&quot; developer and put on a project as lead (and sole) developer and my project was the only one to be completed on time, and with no defects. (This is video game industry, so it wasn&#x27;t exactly a super-simple project; at the time this meant games written 100% in assembly language with all kinds of memory and performance constraints, and a single bug meant Nintendo would reject the image and make you fix the problem. We got our cartridge approved the first time through.)<p>Some programmers are just faster and more intuitive with programming than others. This shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise. Some writers are better and faster than others. Some artists are better and faster than others. Some architects are better and faster than others. Some product designers are better and faster than others. It&#x27;s not <i>all</i> about the number of hours of practice in any of these cases; yes, the best in a field often practices an insane amount. But the very top in each field, despite having similar numbers of hours of practice and experience, can vary in skill by an insane amount. Even some of the best in each field are vastly different in speed: You can have an artist who takes years to paint a single painting, and another who does several per week, but of similar ultimate quality. Humans have different aptitudes. This shouldn&#x27;t even be controversial.<p>I do wonder if the &quot;learned programming at 12&quot; has anything to do with it: Most people will only ever be able to speak a language as fluently as a native speaker if they learn it before they&#x27;re about 13-14 years old. After that the brain (again, for most people; this isn&#x27;t universal) apparently becomes less flexible. In MRI studies they can actually detect differences between the parts of the brain used to learn a foreign language as an adult vs. as a tween or early teen. So there&#x27;s a chance that early exposure to the right concepts actually reshapes the brain. But that&#x27;s just conjecture mixed with my intuition of the situation: When I observe &quot;normal&quot; developers program, it really feels like I&#x27;m a native speaker and they&#x27;re trying to convert between an alien way of thinking about a problem into a foreign language they&#x27;re not that familiar with.<p>AND...there may not be a need to explicitly PROGRAM before you&#x27;re 15 to be good at it as an adult. There are video games that exercise similar brain regions that could substitute for actual programming experience. AND I may be 100% wrong. Would be good for someone to fund some studies.</div><br/><div id="39365097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39365097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">koreth1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39358149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39361737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39364146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39365097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39365097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That childhood native-fluency analogy is insightful!

In my experience, so called &quot;10x&quot; engineers are as productive as they are because they have a process by which they practice the development on software that anticipates future problems. As a result when they check something in, they spend very little time &quot;debugging&quot; or &quot;fixing bugs&quot; with code that does what they already need it to do.<p>It is always very useful as an engineer to log your time, what are you working on &quot;right now&quot; and is it &quot;new work&quot; , &quot;maintenance work&quot;, or &quot;fixing work.&quot; Then for each log entry that isn&#x27;t &quot;new work&quot; thinking about what you could have done that would have caught that problem before it was committed to the code base.<p>I find it is much better to evaluate engineers based on how often they are solving the same problem that they had before vs creating new stuff. That ratio, for me, is the essence of the Nx engineer (for 0.1 &lt; N &lt; 10)<p>The point that Wilson makes that having infrastructure&#x2F;tools that push that ratio further from &quot;repair&quot; work to &quot;new work&quot; is hugely empowering to an organization.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39363655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39363655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devjab</span><span>|</span><a href="#39358149">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39364693">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39364030">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39363655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39363655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience it often comes down to business processes.

He’s not a PO and we don’t do anything too formally because it’s just him, me and another developer + whatever business manager will benefit from the development (and a few testers from their tran). In many ways the way we work these projects are very akin to Team Topologies.<p>At other times I’ll be assigned projects with regular POs, Architects and business employees who barely know what it is they are doing themselves, with poorly defined tasks and all sorts of bureaucratic nonsense “agile” process methods and well spend forever delivering nothing.<p>So sometimes I’m a 50x developer delivering business altering changes.

Sorry it was vague, but there&#x27;s only so much detail you can go into in a blog post aimed at general audiences. Our documentation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antithesis.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antithesis.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a>) has a lot more info.<p>Here&#x27;s my attempt at a more complete answer: think of the story of the blind men and the elephant. There&#x27;s a thing, called fuzzing, invented by security researchers. There&#x27;s a thing, called property-based testing, invented by functional programmers. There&#x27;s a thing, called network simulation, invented by distributed systems people. There&#x27;s a thing, called rare-event simulation, invented by physicists (!). But if you squint, all of these things are really the same kind of thing, which we call &quot;autonomous testing&quot;. It&#x27;s where you express high-level properties of your system, and have the computer do the grunt work to see if they&#x27;re true. Antithesis is our attempt to take the best ideas from each of these fields, and turn them into something really usable for the vast majority of software.<p>We believe the two fundamental problems preventing widespread adoption of autonomous testing are: (1) most software is non-deterministic, but non-determinism breaks the core feedback loop that guides things like coverage-guided fuzzing. (2) the state space you&#x27;re searching is inconceivably vast, and the search problem in full generality is insolubly hard. Antithesis tries to address both of these problems.<p>So... is it fuzzing? Sort of, except you can apply it to whole interacting networked systems, not just standalone parsers and libraries. Is it property-based testing? Sort of, except you can express properties that require a &quot;global&quot; view of the entire state space traversed by the system, which could never be locally asserted in code. Is it fault injection or chaos testing? Sort of, except that it can use the techniques of coverage guided fuzzing to get deep into the nooks and crannies of your software, and determinism to ensure that every bug is replayable, no matter how weird it is.<p>It&#x27;s hard to explain, because it&#x27;s hard to wrap your arms around the whole thing. But our other big goal is to make all of this easy to understand and easy to use. In some ways, that&#x27;s proved to be even harder than the very hard technological problems we&#x27;ve faced. But we&#x27;re excited and up for it, and we think the payoff could be big for our whole industry.<p>Your feedback about what&#x27;s explained well and what&#x27;s explained poorly is an important signal for us in this third very hard task.

A <i>lot</i> of things would have to count as inputs. Think about execution time, for example. CPUs don&#x27;t execute at the same speed all the time because of automatic throttling. Network packets have different flight times. Threads and processes get scheduled a little differently. In distributed&#x2F;concurrent systems, all this matters. If you run the same workload twice, observable events will happen at different times and in different orders because of tiny deviations in initial conditions.<p>So yes, if you consider the time it takes to run every single machine instruction as an &quot;input&quot;, then software is deterministic given the same inputs. But in the real world that&#x27;s not actionable. Even if you had all those inputs, how are you going to pass them in? For all intents and purposes most software execution is non-deterministic.<p>The Antithesis simulation <i>is</i> deterministic in this way though. It is in charge of how long <i>everything</i> takes in &quot;simulated time&quot;, right down to the running times of individual CPU instructions. Everything observable from within the simulation happens the exact same way, every time. You can compare a memory dump at the same (simulated) instant across two different runs and they will be bit-for-bit identical.</div><br/><div id="39361390" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39361390" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">randomdata</span><span>|</span><a href="#39357944">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39361212">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39362764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39361390">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39361390">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; Think about execution time, for example.</i><p>Sure.

The underlying idea at the time didn&#x27;t really take off because it required, like Zookeeper, a greenfield project: except that it kinda doesn&#x27;t and today you could imagine instrumenting an entire Linux syscall table and letting any Linux container become a virtual time system -- but Linux didn&#x27;t exist in 1985 and wouldn&#x27;t be standard until much later.<p>So Jefferson just says, let&#x27;s take your I&#x2F;O-ful process, split it a message-passing actor model, and monitor all the messages going in and coming out. The messages coming out, they won&#x27;t necessarily <i>do what they&#x27;re supposed to do</i> yet, they&#x27;ll just be recorded with a plus sign and a virtual timestamp, and by assumption eventually you&#x27;ll block on some response. So we have a bunch of recorded message timestamps coming in, we have your recorded messages going out.<p>Well, there&#x27;s a problem here, which is that if we have multiple actors we may discover that their timestamps have traveled out-of-order. You sent some message at t=532 but someone actually sent you a message at t=231 that you might have selected instead of whatever you actually selected to send the t=532 message. (For instance in the OS case, they might have literally sent a SIGKILL to your process and you might not have sent anything after that.) That&#x27;s what the plus sign is for, indirectly: we can restart your process from either a known synchronization state or else from the very beginning, we know all of its inputs during its first run so we have &quot;determinized&quot; it up past t=231 to see what it does now. Now, it sends a new message at say t=373. So we use the opposite of +, the minus sign, to send to all the other processes the &quot;undo&quot; message for their t=532 message, this removes it from their message buffer: that will never be sent to them. And if they haven&#x27;t hit that timestamp in their personal processing yet, no further action is needed, otherwise we need to roll them back too. Doing so you determinize the whole networked cluster.<p>The only other really modern implementation of these older ideas that I remember seeing was Haxl[2], a Haskell library which does something similar but rather than using a virtual time coordinate, it just uses a process-local cache: when you request any I&#x2F;O, it first fetches from the cache if possible and then if that&#x27;s not possible it goes out, fetches the data, and then caches it. As a result you can just offer someone a pre-populated cache which, with these recorded inputs, will regenerate the offending stack trace deterministically.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3916.3988" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3916.3988</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;Haxl">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;Haxl</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39362426" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39362426" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EasyMark</span><span>|</span><a href="#39357944">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39359195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39360112">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39360180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39362426">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39362426">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">thanks, I&#x27;ll dig in.

This lets us continue writing async&#x2F;await-style services in tokio but then (in tests) replace them with a deterministic executor that patches all sources of non-determinism (including dependencies that call out to the OS). It&#x27;s pretty seamless.<p>The author of this article isn&#x27;t joking when they say that the startup cost of this effort is monumental. Dealing with every possible source of non-determinism, re-writing services to be testable&#x2F;sans-IO [2], etc. takes a lot of engineering effort.<p>Once the system is in place though, it&#x27;s hard to describe just how confident you feel in your code. Combined with tools like quickcheck [3], you can test hundreds of thousands of subtle failure cases in I&#x2F;O, event ordering, timeouts, dropped packets, filesystem failures, etc.<p>This kind of testing is an incredibly powerful tool to have in your toolbelt, if you have the patience and fortitude to invest in it.<p>As for Antithesis itself, it looks very very cool. Bringing the deterministic testing down the stack to below the OS is awesome. Should make it possible to test entire systems without wiring up a harness manually every time.

So much complexity I&#x27;ve seen in such systems boils down to calling a &quot;function&quot; is: async, depends on the OS, is executed at some point or never, always returns a bunch of strings that need to be parsed to re-enter the static type system, which comes with its own set of failure modes. This makes the seemingly simple task of abstracting logic into a named component, aka a function, extremely complex. You don&#x27;t need to test for any of the subtle failures you mentioned if you leave the logic inside the same process and just call a function.

And your example with writing a file, that too is a somewhat solved problem, use ZFS.

In an ideal world this would be crazy; maybe it is even a little bit crazy today. But I&#x27;ve been bitten too often by bugs in those Packages. For me, it is simply too frustrating to be sidetracked while solving my own problem by the need to debug somebody else&#x27;s software. So, except for linear algebra packages, I usually roll my own. It&#x27;s inefficient, I suppose, but my nerves are calmer.<p>&gt; The most troubling aspect of using Numerical Software Packages, however, is not their occasional goofs, but rather the way the packages inevitably hide deficiencies in a problem&#x27;s formulation. We can dump a set of equations into a solver and it will usually give back a solution without complaint - even if the equations are quite poorly conditioned or have an unsuspected singularity that is distorting the answers from physical reality. Or it may give us an alternative solution that we failed to anticipate. The package helps us ignore these possibilities - or even to detect their occurrence if the execution is buried inside a larger program. Given our capacity for error-blindness, software that actually hides our errors from us is a questionable form of progress.<p>&gt; And if we do detect suspicious behavior, we really can&#x27;t dig into the package to find our troubles. We will simply have to reprogram the problem ourselves. We would have been better off doing so from the beginning - with a good chance that the immersion into the problem&#x27;s reality would have dispelled the logical confusions before ever getting to the machine.<p>I suppose whether to do this depends on how rigorous one is, how rigorous certain dependencies are, and how much time one has. I&#x27;m not going to be writing my own database (too complicated, multiple well-tested options available) but if I only use a subset of the functionality of a smaller package that isn&#x27;t tested well, rolling my own could make sense.</div><br/><div id="39358280" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39358280" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voidmain</span><span>|</span><a href="#39357401">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39358019">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39362035">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39358280">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39358280">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the specific case in question, the biggest problem was that dependencies like Zookeeper weren&#x27;t compatible with our testing approach, so we couldn&#x27;t do true end to end tests unless we replaced them.

Test runs that are particularly interesting can have a lot of extra analysis done, due to our ability to &quot;rewind&quot; and change inputs, get artifacts, add logging, etc.</div><br/><div id="39365879" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39365879" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shuntress</span><span>|</span><a href="#39363492">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39364642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39364529">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39365879">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39365879">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Workloads&quot; seem to be effectively equivalent to integration tests.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to poke holes but I&#x27;m having trouble seeing the value add here.<p>If I have to deploy to some new environment anyways and I have to tailor the &quot;Workloads&quot; anyways why would I pay extra for vendor lock-in?<p>The type of devious bug this is promising to find would be something like:<p><i>&quot;The DB silently drops timezone from Dates because of the column type.

I am not interested in people who have testing teams (ala how it was done before, say 2004) or teams that simply do unit tests and integration tests.  I am interested in people who realized that building the right testing culture is key to their success.  Before reading this article sqlite would probably be my top reference.  I don&#x27;t have the article handy, but the sqlite developers spend like a year building a test framework to make incredibly bulletproof software.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of foundationDB before but the idea of the simulation engine - that&#x27;s exactly what most distributed systems folks need.<p>disclaimer - I work at AWS.  And we have a combination of TLA+, fuzz, and simulation testing. When I first started it was obvious my team had a huge testing gap.  It pains me to say this but for a big part of AWS testing is sort of an after thought.  It comes from the &quot;we don&#x27;t hire test engineers&quot; mentality I suppose - but this likely differs wildly by team. Over the years we&#x27;ve tried to backfill the gap with simulators.  But it is really hard to do this culturally. because it is really hard while you are trying to build new stuff, fix bugs, etc. And your entire team (and leaders) have to be bought into the foundational value of this infrastructure.  And because we don&#x27;t have it, we write COEs, we fix the obvious bugs, but do we take the 1 year it would take to avoid all problems in the future - no.

In the early days of computing computers were claimed to always be deterministic.  Give it the same inputs and you get the same outputs.

Bringing back the determinism may not only be good for testing, it seems likely to improve reliability.

The whole database collapsed into a state where it could only do a few transactions a second.  Then the ops team, thinking they were clever, doubled the size of the cluster in order to give it the resources it needed to get the average utilization down to 45%; this was an unforced error as that pushed the size of the cluster outside the fdb comfort zone (120 nodes) which is itself a problem. The deed was done though and pulling nodes was not possible in this state, so slowly, slooooowly... things got fixed.<p>We ended up spending an entire weekend slowly, slowly getting things back into a good place. We did not lose data, but basically prod was down for the duration, and we found it necessary to _manually_ evict the full nodes one at a time over the period.<p>Now, this was a few years ago, and fdb has performed wickedly fast, with utter, total reliability before that and since, and to this day the ops team is butthurt about fdb.<p>From an engineering perspective, if you aren&#x27;t using java fdb is pretty not great, since the very limited number of abstraction layers that exist are all java-centric. There are many, many issues with the maximum transaction time thing, the maximum key size and value size and total transaction size issue, the lack of pushdown predicates (e.g., filtered scans can&#x27;t be done in-place which means that in AWS, they cost a lot in inter-az network charge terms and also are gated by the network performance of your instances), and so on.<p>What ALL of these have issues have in common is that they bite you late in the game.  The storage issue bites you when you&#x27;re hitting the DB hard in production and have a big data set, the lack of abstractions means that even something as finding leaked junked keys turns out to be impossible unless you were diligent to manually frame all your values so you could identify things as more than just bytes, the transaction time thing is very weird to deal with as you tend to have creeping crud aspects and the lack of libraries that instrument the transactions to give you early warning is an issue, likewise for certain kinds of key-value pairs, there&#x27;s a creeping size problem - hey, this value is an index of other values; if you&#x27;re not very careful up front, you _will_ eventually hit either the txn size limit or the key limit. The usual workarounds for those is to do separate transactions - a staging transaction, then essentially a swap operation and then a garbage collection transaction - but that has lots of issues overtime when coupled with application failure.<p>There are answers to ALL of these, manual ones. For the popular languages other than java - Go, python, maybe Ruby - there _should_ be answers for them, but there aren&#x27;t. These are very sharp edges. Those java layers are _also_ _not_ _bug_ _free_.  So yeah, one has a reliable storage storage layer (a topic that has come up over and over again in the last few years) but it&#x27;s the layer on top of that where all the bugs are, but now with constraints and factors that are harder to reason about than the usual storage layer.<p>One might say, hey, SQL has all of these problems too, except no. You can bump into transaction limits, but the limits are vastly higher than fdb and the transaction time sluggishness will identify it long before you run into the &quot;your transaction is rejected, spin retrying something that will _never_ recover&quot; sort of issue that your average developer will eventually encounter in fdb.<p>That said, I love fdb as a software achievement. I just wish they had finished it. For my current project, I have designed it out. I might be able to avoid all of the sharp edges above at this point, but since we are not a java shop, I also can&#x27;t rely on all the engineers to even know they exist.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39360657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39360657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#39358337">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39358476">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39359985">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39358448">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39360657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39360657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It depends how you define &quot;good&quot;.

It&#x27;s staggering that 49 years later, people are still discovering that having a larger engineering team does not make your work more productive (or better). So what does make work more productive?<p>Productivity requires efficiency. Efficiency is expensive, complicated, nuanced, curt. You can&#x27;t just start out from day 1 with an efficient team or company. It has to be grown, intentionally, continuously, like a garden of fragile flowers in a harsh environment.<p>Is the soil&#x27;s pH right? Good. Is it getting enough sun? Good. Wait, is that leaf a little yellow? Might need to shade it. Hmm, are we watering it too much? Let&#x27;s change some things and see. Ok, doing better now. Ah, it&#x27;s growing fast now. Let&#x27;s trim some of those lower leaves. Hmm, it&#x27;s looking a little tall, is it growing too fast? Maybe it does need more sun after all.<p>If you really pay attention, and continue to make changes towards the goal of efficiency, you&#x27;ll get there. No need for a 10x developer or 3 billion dollars. You just have to listen, look, change, measure, repeat. Eventually you&#x27;ll feel the magic of zooming along productively.

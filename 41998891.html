Entering property for regular maintenance. Any time a landlord or his agent enters a piece of property, there is implicit surveillance. Some places are more formal about this than others, but anyone who has rented, owned rental property, or managed rental property knows that any time maintenance occurs there&#x27;s an implicit examination of the premises also happening...<p>But here is a more pertinent example: the regular comings and goings of people or property can be  and often are observed from outside of a property. These can contribute to probable cause for a search of those premises even without direct observation. (E.g., large numbers of disheveled children moving through an apartment, or an exterior camera shot of a known fugitive entering the property.)<p>Here the police could obtain a warrant on the basis of landlord&#x27;s testimony without the landlord actually seeing the inside of the unit.

The specificity of the search cuts in exactly the opposite direction than you suggest; specificity makes the search far less invasive -- BUT, at the same time, the &quot;everywhere and always&quot; nature of the search makes it more invasive.

If the executive branch starts compelling companies to help them discover political enemies on basis of non-criminal activity, then the court&#x27;s opinions will have exactly as much force as the army that court proves capable of raising, because such an executive would likely have no respect for the rule of law in any case...<p>It is reasonable for legislators to draft laws on a certain assumption of good faith, and for courts to interpret law on a certain assumption of good faith, because without that good faith the law is nothing more than a sequence of forceless ink blotches on paper anyways.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42001992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42001992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41999255">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42000232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42000705">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42001992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42001992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think that changes anything.  I think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for Party A to be actively watching the rented property to see if crimes are being committed, either by the renter (Party B) or by someone else.<p>The difference I <i>do</i> see, however, is that many places do have laws that restrict this sort of surveillance.  If we&#x27;re talking about an apartment building, a landlord can put cameras in common areas of the building, but cannot put cameras inside individual units.  And with the exception of emergencies, many places require that a landlord give tenants some amount of notice before entering their unit.<p>So if Google is checking user images against known CSAM image hashes, are those user images sitting out in the common areas, or are they in an individual tenant&#x27;s unit?  I think it should be obvious that it&#x27;s the latter, not the former.<p>Maybe this is more like a company that rents out storage units.  Do storage companies generally have the right to enter their customers&#x27; storage units whenever they want, without notice or notification?  Many storage companies allow customers to put their own locks on their units, so even if they have the right to enter whenever they want, regularly, in practice they certainly do not.<p>But like all analogies, this one is going to have flaws.  Even if we can&#x27;t match it up with a real-world example, maybe there&#x27;s still no inconsistency or problem here.  Google&#x27;s ToS says they can and will do this sort of scanning, users agree to it, and there&#x27;s no law saying Google can&#x27;t do that sort of thing.  Google itself has no obligation to preserve users&#x27; 4th Amendment rights; they passed along evidence to the police.  I do think the police should be required to obtain a warrant before gaining access to the underlying data; the judge agrees on this, but the police get away with it in the original case due to the bullshit &quot;good faith exception&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41999990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41999990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kulahan</span><span>|</span><a href="#41999255">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999558">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42000232">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999331">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41999990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41999990">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is an excellent example, I think I get it now and I&#x27;m fully on-board.

If they had visually confirmed it was the image they suspected it was based on the hash then no warrant would have been required, but the judge reads that the image hash match is not equivalent to a visual confirmation of the image.  Maybe there&#x27;s some slight doubt in whether or not the image could be a hash collision, which depends on the hash method.  It may be incredibly unlikely (near impossible?) for any hash collision depending on the specific hash strategy.<p>I think it would obviously be less than ideal for Google to require an employee visually inspect child pornography identified by image hash before informing a legal authority like the police.  So it seems more likely that the remedy to this situation would be for the police to obtain a warrant after getting the tip but before requesting the raw data from Google.<p>Would the image hash match qualify as probable cause enough for a warrant?  On page 4 the judge stops short of setting precedence on whether it would have or not.

Also, it is not clear that matters of fact decided by the Supreme Court are binding to lower courts. Additionally, facts and even meanings of words themselves can change, which makes previous findings of fact no longer applicable. That&#x27;s actually true in this case as well. &quot;Hash&quot; as used in the context of images generally meant something like an MD5 hash (which itself is now more prone to collisions than before). The &quot;hash&quot; in the Google case appears to be a perceptual hash, which I don&#x27;t think was as commonly used until recently (I could be wrong here). So whatever findings of fact were made by the Supereme Court about how reliable a hash is is not necessarily relevant to begin with. Looking at this specific case, here is the full quote from United States v. Ackerman:<p>&gt;How does AOL&#x27;s screening system work? It relies on hash value matching. A hash value is (usually) a short string of characters generated from a much larger string of data (say, an electronic image) using an algorithm—and calculated in a way that makes it highly unlikely another set of data will produce the same value. Some consider a hash value as a sort of digital fingerprint. See Richard P. Salgado, Fourth Amendment Search and the Power of the Hash, 119 Harv. L. Rev. F. 38, 38-40 (2005). AOL&#x27;s automated filter works by identifying the hash values of images attached to emails sent through its mail servers.[0]<p>I don&#x27;t have access to this issue of Harvard Law Review but looking at the first page, it says:<p>&gt;Hash algorithms are used to confirm that when a copy of data is made, the original is unaltered and the copy is identical, bit-for-bit.[1]<p>This is clearly referring to a cryptographic hash like MD5, not a perceptual hash&#x2F;neural hash as in Google. So the actual source here is not necessarily dealing with the same matters of fact as the source of the quote here (although there could be valid comparisons between them).<p>All this said, judges feel more confident in citing a Supreme Court case than a textbook because 1. it is easier to understand for them 2. the matter of fact is then already tied to a legal matter, instead of the judge having to make that leap himself and also 3. judges are more likely to read relevant case law to begin with since they will read it to find precedent in matters of law – which are binding to lower courts. This is why a &quot;CS for Judges&quot; could be a useful reference book.<p>Lastly, I should have looked a bit more closely at the quoted case. This is actually not a supreme court case at all. Gorsuch was nominated in 2017 and this case is from 2016.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;united-states-v-ackerman-12" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casetext.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;united-states-v-ackerman-12</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heinonline.org&#x2F;HOL&#x2F;LandingPage?handle=hein.journals&#x2F;forharoc119&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heinonline.org&#x2F;HOL&#x2F;LandingPage?handle=hein.journals&#x2F;...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41999168" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41999168" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vlovich123</span><span>|</span><a href="#42001310">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999153">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41999168">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41999168">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As the district court correctly ruled in the alternative, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule supports denial of Maher’s suppression motion because, at the time authorities opened his uploaded file, they had a good faith basis to believe that no warrant was required<p>So this means this conviction is upheld but future convictions may be overturned if they similarly don&#x27;t acquire a warrant?</div><br/><div id="41999366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41999366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nordsieck</span><span>|</span><a href="#41999168">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41999366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41999366">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule supports denial of Maher’s suppression motion because, at the time authorities opened his uploaded file, they had a good faith basis to believe that no warrant was required<p>This &quot;good faith exception&quot; is so absurd I struggle to believe that it&#x27;s real.<p>Ordinary citizens are expected to understand and scrupulously abide by all of the law, but it&#x27;s enough for law enforcement to believe that what they&#x27;re doing is legal even if it isn&#x27;t?<p>What that is is a punch line from a Chapelle bit[1], not a reasonable part of the justice system.<p>---<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0WlmScgbdws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0WlmScgbdws</a></div><br/><div id="41999722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41999722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#41999168">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42000004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41999722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41999722">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The courts accept good faith arguments at times.

The first argument is a practical one, that AI-generated images would be indistinguishable from the &quot;real thing&quot;, but that the real thing still being out there would complicate their efforts to investigate and prosecute. While everyone might agree that this is pragmatic, it&#x27;s not necessarily constitutionally valid. We shouldn&#x27;t prohibit activities based on whether these activities make it more difficult for authorities to investigate crimes. Besides, this one&#x27;s technically moot... those producing the images could do so in such a way (from a technical standpoint) that they were instantly, automatically, and indisputably provable as being AI-generated.<p>All images could be mandated to require embedded metadata which describes the model, seed, and so forth necessary to regenerate it. Anyone who needs to do so could push a button, the computer would attempt to regenerate the image from that seed, and the computer could even indicate that the two images matched (the person wouldn&#x27;t even need to personally view the image for that to be the case). If the application indicated they did not match, then authorities could investigate it more thoroughly.<p>The second argument is an economic one. That is, if a person &quot;consumes&quot; such material, they increase economic demand for it to be created. Even in a post-AI world, some &quot;creation&quot; would be criminal. Thus, the consumer of such imagery does cause (indirectly) more child abuse, and the government is justified in prohibiting AI-generated material. This is a weak argument on the best of days... one of the things that law enforcement efforts excel at is just this. When there are two varieties of a behavior, one objectionable and the other not, but both similar enough that they might at a glance be mistaken for one another, is that it can greatly disincentivize one without infringing the other. Being an economic argument, one of the things that might be said is that economic actors seek to reduce their risk of doing business, and so would gravitate to creating the legal variety of material.<p>While their arguments are dumb, this filth&#x27;s as reprehensible as anything. The only question worth asking or answering is, were (AI-generated) it legal, would it result in fewer children being harmed or not? It&#x27;s commonly claimed that the easy availability of mainstream pornography has reduced the rate of rape since the mid-20th century.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41999881" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41999881" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p0w3n3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#41999153">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41999881">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41999881">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem with the internet nowadays is that a few big players are making up their own law.

  - gmail correctly detects and flags it based on hash value
  - Google sends message to NCMEC based on hash value
  - NCMEC sends it to police based on hash value
</code></pre>
Now police are facing the obvious question, is this actually CP? They open the image, determine it is, then get a warrant to search his gmail account, and (later) another warrant to search his home.<p>The court here is saying they should have got a warrant to even look at the image in the first place. But warrants only issue on probable cause. What&#x27;s the PC here? The hash value. What&#x27;s the probability of hash collisions? Non-zero but very low.<p>The practical upshot of this is that all reports from NCMEC will now go through an extra step of the police submitting a copy of the report with the hash value and some boilerplate document saying &#x27;based on my law enforcement experience, hash values are pretty reliable indicators of fundamental similarity&#x27;, and the warrant application will then be rubber stamped by a judge.<p>An analogous situation would be where I send a sealed envelope with some documents to the police, writing on the outside &#x27;I believe the contents of this envelope are proof that John Doe committed [specific crime]&#x27;, and the police have to get a warrant to open the envelope. It&#x27;s arguably more legally consistent, but in practice it just creates an extra stage of legal bureaucracy&#x2F;delay with no appreciable impact on the eventual outcome.<p>Recall that the standard for issuance of a warrant is &#x27;probable cause&#x27;, not &#x27;mathematically proven cause&#x27;. Hash collisions are a possibility, but a sufficiently unlikely one that <i>it doesn&#x27;t matter</i>. Probable cause means &#x27;a fair probability&#x27; based on independent evidence of some kind - testimony, observation, forensic results or so. Even a shitty hash function that&#x27;s only 90% reliable is going to meet that threshold. In the 10% of cases where the opened file turns out to be a random image with no pornographic content it&#x27;s a &#x27;no harm no foul&#x27; situation.<p>For reference, a primer on hash collision probabilities: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preshing.com&#x2F;20110504&#x2F;hash-collision-probabilities&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preshing.com&#x2F;20110504&#x2F;hash-collision-probabilities&#x2F;</a><p>and a more detailed examination of common perceptual hashing algorithms (skip to table 3 for the collision probabilities): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceur-ws.org&#x2F;Vol-2904&#x2F;81.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ceur-ws.org&#x2F;Vol-2904&#x2F;81.pdf</a><p>I think what a lot of people are implicitly arguing here is that the detection system needs to be <i>perfect</i> before anyone can do anything. Nobody wants the job of examining images to check if they&#x27;re CP or not, so we&#x27;ve outsourced it to machines that do so with good-but-not-perfect accuracy and then pass the hot potato around until someone has to pollute their visual cortex with it.<p>Obviously we don&#x27;t want to arrest or convict people based on computer output alone, but how good does it have to be (in % or odds terms) in order to begin an investigation - not of the alleged criminal, but of the evidence itself? Should companies like Google have to submit an estimate of the probability of hash collisions using their algorithm and based on the number of image hashes that exist on their servers at any given moment?

Hash collisions are a possibility, but a sufficiently unlikely one that it doesn&#x27;t matter. Probable cause means &#x27;a fair probability&#x27; based on independent evidence of some kind - testimony, observation, forensic results or so. Even a shitty hash function that&#x27;s only 90% reliable is going to meet that threshold. In the 10% of cases where the opened file turns out to be a random image with no pornographic content it&#x27;s a &#x27;no harm no foul&#x27; situation.<p>But do we actually know that? Do we know what the thresholds of &quot;similarity&quot; are in use by google and others, and how many false positives they trigger? Billions of photos are processed daily by googles services (google photo, chat programs, gmail, drive, etc.), and very few people actually send such stuff via gmail, so what if the reality is, that 99.9% of the matches are actually false positives?

And how would running it through a judge first improve that process?<p><i>What about intentional matches, like someone intentionally creating some random SFW meme image [...]</i><p>OK, but what is the probability of that happening? And if such images are being mailed in bulk, what would be the purpose other than to provide cover for CSAM traders? The tactic would only be viable for as long as it takes a platform operator to change up their hashing algorithm. And again, how would the extra legal step of consulting a judge alleviate this?<p><i>should police really be checking all those emails, photos, etc., without warrants?</i><p>But that&#x27;s not happening. As I pointed out, police examined the submitted image evidence to determine of it was CP (it was). Then <i>they got a warrant</i> to search the gmail account, and following that <i>another warrant</i> to search his home. The didn&#x27;t investigate the criminal first, the investigated an image file submitted to them to determine whether it was evidence of a crime.<p>And yet again, how would bouncing this off a judge improve the process? The judge will just look at the report submitted to the police and a standard police letter saying &#x27;reports of this kind are reliable in our experience&#x27; and then tell the police yes, go ahead and look.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42000193" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42000193" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nwhnwh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42000984">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42000349">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42000193">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42000193">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is the context of this?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42000349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42000349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">austin-cheney</span><span>|</span><a href="#42000193">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999084">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42000349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42000349">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Status quo, there is no change here.<p>The old example is the email server administrator.  If the email administrator has to view the contents of user messages as a part of regular maintenance and that email administrator notices lawful violations in those user messages they can report it to law enforcement.  In that case law enforcement can receive the material without a warrant only if law enforcement never asked for it before it was gifted to them.  There are no fourth amendment protections provided to offenders in this scenario of third party accidental discovery.  Typically, in these cases the email administrator does not have an affirmed requirement to report lawful violations to law enforcement unless specific laws claim otherwise.<p>If on the other hand law enforcement approaches that email administrator to fish for illegal user content then that email administrator has become an extension of law enforcement and any evidence discovered cannot be used in a criminal proceeding.  Likewise, if the email administrator was intentionally looking through email messages for violations of law even not at the request of law enforcement they are still acting as agents of the law.  In that case discovery was intentional and not an unintentional product of system maintenance.<p>There is a third scenario: obscenity. Obscenity is illegal intellectual property, whether digital or physical, as defined by criminal code.  Possession of obscene materials is a violation of criminal law for all persons, businesses, and systems in possession.  In that case an email administrator that accidentally discovers obscene material does have a required obligation to report their discoveries, typically through their employer&#x27;s corporate legal process, to law enforcement.  Failures to disclose such discoveries potentially aligns the system provider to the illegal conduct of the violating user.<p>Google&#x27;s discovery, though, was not accidental as a result of system maintenance.  It was due to an intentional discovery mechanism based on stored hashes, which puts Google&#x27;s conduct in line with law enforcement even if they specified their conduct in their terms of service.  That is why the appeals court claims the district court erred by denying the defendant&#x27;s right to suppression on fourth amendment grounds.<p>The saving grace for the district court was a good faith exception, such as inevitable discovery.  The authenticity and integrity of the hash algorithm was never in question by any party so no search for violating material was necessary, which established probably cause thus allowing law enforcement reasonable grounds to proceed to trial.  No warrant was required because the evidence was likely sufficient at trial even if law enforcement did not directly view image in question, but they did verify the image.  None of that was challenged by either party.  What was challenged was just Google&#x27;s conduct.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41999084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41999084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">henryfjordan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42000349">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41999583">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41999084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41999084">[40 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The judge doesn&#x27;t really understand a hash well.

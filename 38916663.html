 My sony android smart TV looks amazing but the UI is so slow as to be unusable.<p>An unstable UI that is always changing also violates most of these principles. Smart TVs seem to be exceptionally bad in this area too, with the home screen layout and app icons frequently changing positions for no apparent reason.<p>While I&#x27;m complaining, my other pet peeve, which unfortunately is only getting worse is: unlabeled icons (often without even tooltips).

However, Snapchat’s user experience is not bad. It’s actually an incredibly smart design. Their challenging user experience is what keeps them relevant to their primary target audience: teenagers and millennials.<p>&gt; It keeps the adults out..Snapchat is a safe place for teens. They intentionally made the user interface challenging to grasp in order to make it difficult for adults to use. Most adults would not bother putting up the effort to learn how to use the app, leading to its abandonment. All content is ephemeral with strict limitations on editing. Most content is sent privately, and no content can be publicly rated or compared. Adults would not bother putting up the effort to learn how to use the app, leading to its abandonment.

Chasing the specifics makes horrible software. Some people equate less diversity in their UI to more consistency.<p>It’s about letting someone become an expert in your software.<p>Microsoft office was always his example. People pride themselves on “knowing” Microsoft office. They jump between all of the apps because they have a feel for the inertia of “office”. I have the exact same feeling in Vim. I just know how things are expected to be, and new (well made) plugins tend to respect those patterns.<p>Office and (Neo)Vim aren’t exceptional examples of UI, but they are uniquely stable.</div><br/><div id="38920151" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38920151" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xp84</span><span>|</span><a href="#38919072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38919109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38920151">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38920151">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a non-&quot;Designer&quot; something I never shut up about is how powerful it is to bootstrap that expertness by leveraging the UI elements and concepts your users already know from elsewhere, for instance, literal native UI widgets, and more broadly, highly-recognizable simple fundamental widget types. When you have the opportunity to present 4 options, you could use your brand&#x27;s themed version of [Insert UI Library]&#x27;s searchable combobox with checkable items, or you could show 4 normal labeled radio buttons or checkboxes. The latter beats the former in every way:<p>1. User knows whether they can pick one vs many based on the circles vs squares.<p>2. User can see all four options, even if the widget ends up unfortunately placed in the viewport (I&#x27;ve had to scroll inside these and only be able to see like 2 options at once, <i>so many times</i>).<p>3. No issues with mobile keyboard wanting to open to let you &quot;search&quot;, further obstructing the tiny viewport.<p>4. Accessibility will always be 100%.<p>Yet this option &quot;fails&quot; in the category of &quot;looks cute with our Design System&quot; so usually designers choose the first choice, and worse, &quot;standardize&quot; on doing that, so that using normal widgets is a &quot;bug.&quot;<p>Ultimately too many &quot;UX designers&quot; are hacks, who worship and pursue aesthetics and branding at the expense of everything else. A UI widget isn&#x27;t the time or place to assert your brand or creativity, any more than you should design your own font that forces all letters to be shapes from your logo. Your customers don&#x27;t care about your brand more than being able to complete their tasks.</div><br/><div id="38923463" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38923463" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hutzlibu</span><span>|</span><a href="#38919072">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38920151">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38920913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38923463">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38923463">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;you could use your brand&#x27;s themed version of [Insert UI Library]&#x27;s searchable combobox with checkable items, or you could show 4 normal labeled radio buttons or checkboxes. &quot;<p>Ahhh ... that&#x27;s likely a Stilbruch (break of style) my design professor would have exclaimed. Designers hate those and I came to understand why and try to avoid it wherever possible. It is something that can be irritating and bringing in confusion, if suddenly there is a element out of place.<p>But you can have &quot;highly-recognizable simple fundamental widget types&quot; without breaking the style. It is just harder and of course, a functional ugly design is in my opinion still way better than a good looking broken design.

Don&#x27;t forget that pilots are people too with emotional needs.<p>Don Hopkins:<p>Beauty should take a back seat when it comes to safety, usability, and accessibility, not only in airline cockpits, but in most other interfaces, too. Your statement that &quot;there is just no reason an interface should be anything but beautiful&quot; is extreme and dangerous.<p>Michael Darius:<p>An interface is a habitat for a persons soul to dwell. Some habitats are better than others and there some awfully designed habitats out there.<p>Don Hopkins:<p>There are many reasons why, and many things more important than beauty. A spreadsheet is more beautiful if it hides the ugly truth about the formulas, relationships, numbers, dependencies, and complexities. Its purpose isn&#x27;t to be easy on the eyes, it&#x27;s to be correct.<p>Are your earpods supposed to be beautiful, at the expense of being comfortable and actually fitting in your ears and not itching and poking and flaking paint and decorations into the holes on your head?

Airplanes and spreadsheets need ugly affordances.<p>Michael Darius:<p>You can tell when something has been thought through on the inside, just as much as it has on the outside and most of the people who disagree with me in practice have simply never had the opportunity to work with engineers who care more about what is under the hood than what can be seen by the naked eye.<p>I see no difference between beauty and the reduction in the margin for human error.<p>[Photo of two children piloting an airplane.]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;darius&#x2F;status&#x2F;1741195625767772529" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;darius&#x2F;status&#x2F;1741195625767772529</a><p>Don Hopkins:<p>You just have an extreme personal opinion about beauty if you think removing scrollbars and buttons and even cluttered features from iPad interfaces, and making airplane cockpits look like playschool toys, always equals beauty.

And that it can be measured. It can&#x27;t. Address that, please.<p>Michael Darius:<p>When effort has been put into an interface to simplify a function, the function itself becomes more beautiful. We see this when writing code. If I can perform an operation by writing 3 lines of code instead of 10, the margin for error decreases.<p>[An image with an example of &quot;Ugly vs Beautiful&quot; code claiming that a one-liner is more beautiful than 6 lines of equivalent code.]<p>Don Hopkins:<p>Again, you&#x27;re pretending that beauty is not subjective, and that you know the one universal definition of beauty, and I would have expected better from you, and even more from a first year art student. Would the Mona Lisa be more beautiful with less paint?<p>Would the Sistine Chapel be more beautiful with stick figures like an XKCD comic? Get off your high horse of thinking you can define beauty.

I ask you again: define and defend the words you first chose and wrote yourself.<p>Your original statement is indefensible, so go back and try defending it instead of trying to move the goalposts and pretend you have a monopoly on the definition of beauty.<p>Your original statement didn&#x27;t say anything about necessity or usefulness, as I said before. In fact it PRECLUDED them by claiming interfaces should ONLY be beautiful: &quot;There is just NO REASON why an interface should be ANYTHING BUT beautiful.&quot; Stop deflecting.

How about you two actually go to FAA or some shit and consult with them if it&#x27;s possible to make a cockpit more beautiful but retain its practicality. I feel like the argument wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without trying to do something for real.<p>Don Hopkins:<p>You suggest us just walking in the front door of FAA headquarters, waltzing through security, and insisting on a meeting with the heads of the FAA to redesign their interfaces? Should Darius and I drop all we&#x27;re doing and volunteer our time to do that for free?<p>Michael Darius:<p>The images themself do a better job of communicating what I mean by &quot;beauty standards for excellence&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve never met a designer who didn&#x27;t feel that their responsibility was to defend beauty standards for excellence and I&#x27;m not different.<p>The mechanics of a jail door might be functional and usable by a door guard but there is nothing beautiful about building more prisons.<p>Habitats for humanity cares more deeply about the ACTUAL lived experiences people are ACTUALLY having.<p>[...

Other commenters compared them to WinAmp, but I don&#x27;t believe WinAmp&#x27;s infinite and easy skinnability is nearly as maliciously terrible or professionally irresponsible as the QuickTime 4 player (I expected SO MUCH MORE from a company like Apple that published Tog&#x27;s original UI guidelines), or VLC (which is an open source project without any money or professional UI designers).<p>HN discussion:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18212478">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18212478</a><p>One of my comments (among several), which includes a thread about VLC:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18219757">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18219757</a><p>You can see that I actually give a shit enough about VLC to have spend quite a bit of time analyzing the problem and writing up bug reports, but the culture of the project is so insular and &quot;NIH&quot; that they don&#x27;t give a shit about user interface design. So I have little hope that VLC will ever improve. But at least Apple finally improved their QuickTime 4 Player in response to acceoss-the-board criticism.<p>A counter example to the rule of thumb that open source user interfaces are terrible is Blender. Especially when you compare it to GIMP (which is like shooting fish in a barrel, but still is an instructive comparison of cultures).<p>Blender was infamous for its complex non-standard confusing user interface design, but they LISTENED TO THEIR USERS and vastly improved it!<p>But of course there is no way of getting around the fact that it&#x27;s an extremely complex tool that&#x27;s used differently by a wide range of people, so a lot of that complexity is necessary, and you can&#x27;t just simplify it away and dumb it down without destroying its usefulness.<p>One thing Blender does have excellent support for is pie menus! And there are some great pie menu editors, which are important because every different Blender user has their own workflow and set of common commands. So Blender users need to customize and define their own pie menus. Just like HyperCard enabled normal users to construct their own task oriented user interfaces.<p>(Of course Steve Jobs hated pie menus, which is a story I can tell you about later, or maybe you can tell me the Apple side of that story: Why didn&#x27;t Apple ever adopt pie menus for MacOS or iOS?)<p>Pie menus have the potential of being both beautiful, efficient, reliable (low error rates), and easy to use, but it takes a lot more design and programming to pull off than a traditional linear menu.<p>Simon Schneegans is a brilliant user interface designer as well as an accomplished programmer, and he has developed not only beautiful pie menus (for example the Coral and Trace menu he did for his Master&#x27;s thesis years ago, and he more recent work on Gnome-Pie, Fly-Pie, and the cross platform Kandu pie menus for desktop app launching, window management, text selection, and many other tasks).<p>The Trace-Menu

I just sent him my old Mac laptop so he can support the Mac desktop well. The way it works is by using Electron with a full screen transparent overlay window, so it can draw the pie menus with html&#x2F;css&#x2F;svg&#x2F;canvas or any other standards based web technologies.<p>Kando becomes useful for the first time!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7vVdJ9LORAM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7vVdJ9LORAM</a><p>&gt;With Kando, I am creating an open-source pie menu which runs on Windows, Linux and (eventually) macOS.

But in that case what makes it not beautiful is not that the interface elements aren’t beautiful. What makes it not beautiful is that what is under the hood isn’t beautiful and what is under the hood is more often than not not thought through the way it should be.<p>My definition of ‘beauty’ is inseparable from my definition of functional design:<p>An interface should go beyond usable, it should delight, create enjoyment, provide a sense of safety and control over one’s environment, it should be beautifully engineered inside and out and when any one of those pieces go missing beauty itself goes missing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38919109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38919109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Angostura</span><span>|</span><a href="#38919072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38920151">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38920618">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38919109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38919109">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s possibly one of the reasons why so many people were bent out of shape when MS introduced the adaptive ribbon shenanigans that tried to &#x27;help&#x27; by only showing the most likely options.

The way a novice uses them is actually rehearsal for how a more experienced and experts use them.<p>Unlike invisible gestures, they can pop up and show users the available items. They also support reselection and browsing, which gestures don&#x27;t. They also utilize 100% of possible &quot;gesture space&quot; as meaningful predictable actions, as opposed to gesture recognition which squanders most possible gestures as syntax errors.<p>Gesture Space:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.medium.com&#x2F;gesture-space-842e3cdc7102" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.medium.com&#x2F;gesture-space-842e3cdc7102</a><p>Unlike pull-down menus that have keyboard shortcuts, pie menu &quot;shortcuts&quot; are exactly the same action a novice takes to use them in the first place, only quicker, so using them in the slow way trains you to use them in the fast way. While selecting from a linear menu with the mouse is a totally different action than selecting a menu shortcut with the keyboard.<p>Ben Shneiderman introduces Don Hopkins&#x27; work on pie menus in Spring 1989 on a Sun Workstation, running the NeWS window system:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8Fne3j7cWzg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8Fne3j7cWzg</a><p>After an 1991 intro by Ben Shneiderman we see the older 1989 demo by Don Hopkins showing many examples of pie menus on a Sun Workstation, running the NEWS operating system.<p>This is work done at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland.<p>A pie menu is a menu technique where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distance from the center. Several examples are demonstrated on a Sun running NeWS window system, including the use of pie menus and gestures for window management, the simultaneous entry of 2 arguments (by using angle and distance from the center), scrollable pie menus, precision pie menus, etc.  We can see that gestures were possible (with what Don call &quot;mouse ahead&quot; ) so you could make menu selections without even displaying the menu. Don uses an artifact he calls &quot;mousee&quot; so we can see what he is doing but that extra display was only used for the video, i.e. as a user you could make selections with gestures without the menu ever appearing, but the description of those more advanced features was never published.<p>Pretty advance for 1989... i.e. life before the Web, when mice were just starting to spread, and you could graduate from the CS department without ever even using one.<p>This video was published in the 1991 HCIL video but the demo itself - and recording of the video - dates back  to 1989 at least, as pictures appear in the handout of the May 1989 HCIL annual Open House.<p>The original Pie Menu paper is Callahan, J., Hopkins, D., Weiser, M., Shneiderman, B., An empirical comparison of pie vs. linear menus;

Animation should never delay interaction, and it should never interfere with gestures and mouse-ahead (or whatever the input device is).<p>The user should never have to wait for animation to finish before they&#x27;re able to do something, and the interface should never be disabled during animation, or ever ignore the user&#x27;s input under any circumstances.<p>User input should always pre-empt and interrupt feedback and animation.<p>The interface should always support quick gestures (mousing ahead, touching ahead, or whatever), without ever requiring the user to pause and wait, or focus their attention on the screen to watch the animation play out before they know it&#x27;s safe to make the next move.<p>I developed a gestural pie menu tabbed window manager for the NeWS window system in 1990, which supported mousing ahead, suppressing the pie menu display and pop-up animation until you stopped moving, showing light weight feedback on the overlay plane, and executing commands instantly without any animation or even popping up the menu, when you make a smooth quick gesture without hesitating.<p>NeWS Tab Window Demo:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tMcmQk-q0k4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tMcmQk-q0k4</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;movies&#x2F;TabWindowDemo.mov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;movies&#x2F;TabWindowDemo.mov</a><p>Transcript of the relevant part of the demo:<p>Now you can press the right button to pop up a pie menu on the tab or on the frame itself. And that has commonly used commands like front and back in mnemonic directions. Back is down, and front is up.<p>When you make a menu selection by mousing ahead, it doesn&#x27;t display the menu.<p>As long as you&#x27;re moving, it suppresses the menu display.<p>And it gives you feedback on the overlay plane of the slice that you&#x27;re in, and the label of that slice, so you can actually see what you&#x27;re going to get before you choose it without even seeing the menu itself.<p>And when you wait, it pops up the menu once you stop moving.<p>So if you waste some time by just waiting around, it will waste a bit more time by giving you some stupid animation.<p>And this is meant to be negative reinforcement, to encourage you to mouse ahead.<p>The sub-menu pops up. This is &quot;move to&quot; which is unconstrained move.<p>You can always get that from the tab by mousing left and right.<p>That&#x27;s an easy gesture. Just quickly...<p>Or mouse there and wait. There it is. It pops up the one you&#x27;re at first.<p>This is constrained horizontal move.<p>And this is constrained vertical move.<p>So constrained horizontal... We&#x27;ll wait.<p>Constrained vertical...<p>So, I mean, once you&#x27;re there, and you know what you want, why wait?<p>This is &quot;beam me up&quot;: put it in the next layout position. To tidy the windows.<p>So, if you&#x27;ve clicked the menu up and haven&#x27;t moved, it will just spin it, because it&#x27;s confused, and doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to do.<p>----<p>In other words: As it pops up and scales up the round menu, it also tilts it along the axis perpendicular to the direction of movement to reinforce the selected direction, or spins around the center if you haven&#x27;t moved to show no direction is selected.<p>And you only ever see any animation if you actually stop moving -- once you make a selection, the command always executes or the submenu always activates immediately.<p>You can mouse ahead smoothly through multiple levels of sub-menus, without popping any of them up or seeing any animation, as long as you never hesitate.<p>By &quot;lead, follow, or get out of the way&quot;, I mean that pie menus can lead novice users by giving them feedback and animation when they pause, follow intermediate users who move in the right direction then pause for the feedback to make sure they got it right, and get out of the way of expert users who know the right direction and can quickly articulate gestures without pausing or waiting for feedback.<p>----<p>Here&#x27;s another demo showing pie menus, mouse ahead gestures, and display pre-emption in SimCity:<p>X11 SimCity Demo:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Jvi98wVUmQA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Jvi98wVUmQA</a><p>----<p>And here&#x27;s a really old demo from June 1986 of the &quot;uwm&quot; window manager for the X10 window system, that I hacked to support pie menus with mouse-ahead and display pre-emption.<p>X10 Pie Menu Window Manager:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IJhvB6kwmog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IJhvB6kwmog</a><p>---<p>More info here:<p>The Design and Implementation of Pie Menus -- Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal, Dec. 1991:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.medium.com&#x2F;the-design-and-implementation-of-pie-menus-80db1e1b5293" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donhopkins.medium.com&#x2F;the-design-and-implementation-...</a></div><br/><div id="38921182" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38921182" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joeblubaugh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38919072">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38920618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38921848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38921182">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38921182">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you know of any work about how to combine pie menus and keyboard usage?

My computing colleagues were intrigued by my early attempts to use empirical techniques to study programmers as they wrote, modified, or debugged programs. These crossover ideas caught the attention of Azriel Rosenfeld (1931–2004), a world leader in computer vision, who was forming an interdisciplinary Center for Automation Research (CfAR). He led the Computer Vision Lab and invited me to form a Human-Computer Interaction Lab when he launched CfAR in 1983. In a campus reorganization, HCIL became a unit in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and eventually became jointly managed with the iSchool.<p>&gt;Rosenfeld&#x27;s invitation advanced my efforts by at least five years, giving credibility to the &quot;marriage of computer science and psychology,&quot; which I described in my 1980 book, Software Psychology. Gaining credibility was important, as this was still a time when many computer scientists were unsure about the value of psychological studies of programmers and database systems&#x27; users, and even the growing field of interactive computer systems. The term human-computer interaction (HCI) was still novel, but I insisted on putting the human first, as opposed to the ACM&#x27;s choice of computer-human interaction to make a more pronounceable name, &quot;CHI.&quot;<p>Ken Perlin:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ken_Perlin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ken_Perlin</a><p>Ken Perlin&#x27;s Blog:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kenperlin.com&#x2F;?p=237" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kenperlin.com&#x2F;?p=237</a><p>&gt;Human first (May 29th, 2008)<p>&gt;I spent the day today at the annual end-of-year symposium of the Human Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) at the University of Maryland. All three of the Lab’s successive directors – Ben Shneiderman, Ben Bederson and Allison Druin – were there, and they are all good friends of mine. Ben Shneiderman founded the lab in 1983. He is one of the fathers of the field of HCI research, and is a font of wisdom on many subjects. Ben Bederson, with whom I’ve been friends since he was in grad school, took over the lab directorship in 2000. Allison, who is married to Ben Bederson, became the lab’s director in 2006. I actually know Allison the longest of the three. I have had lots of time to talk with all three of them in the last twenty four hours, which has been great fun.<p>&gt;The wonderful thing about the HCIL, as Allison pointed out today, is that it puts the “human” first. Much of computer science research seems to forget that there are such things as humans. Instead it seems to be a quest for a kind of abstract algorithmic purity, as though computer science were merely a branch of mathematics. The HCIL people have been way ahead of the curve in recognizing that the real power of computers comes when we find ways to interweave that power with the complementary power of the human mind. Computation is indeed enormously powerful, but computation that augments human thought is downright transformative. And to achieve that, you’ve got to understand human thought.<p>&gt;This is rather tricky for many academics, because it requires bridging the large gap in scientific subcultures between computer science on the one hand, and psychology on the other. It’s very hard to get academic recognition when any given reviewer of your manuscript is not going to understand half of what you are saying. To me the people at HCIL are visionary because they recognized, a full quarter of a century ago – long before it was fashionable – the need to reconcile these two parts of the problem.<p>&gt;And they are still at it. Only now the world is starting to catch up.<p>&gt;Ben Shneiderman says on June 3, 2008 at 8:12 pm:<p>&gt;Thanks Ken… for your kind words and thoughtful contribution to the 25th Anniversary events…. it’s great to see that our message was heard and received in a warm human way.

Here is some information about why hyperlinks are blue, from Ben Shneiderman’s answer to a question I asked him about the origin of the term “hyperlink”. I think your belief that HyperTIES was not the first instance of blue hyperlinks because it used cyan links is splitting hairs, and a “No Blue Scotsman” argument, especially since Tim Berners-Lee told Ben Sheniderman at the time that he was influenced by Ben’s design as he saw it in the HyperTIES-based “Hypertext on Hypertext” that ACM distributed with the articles from the July 1987 Hypertext conference at the University of North Carolina. Ben describes the color as “light blue”, which he chose from the limited palette available on PCs at the time, based on controlled experiments he and his students performed comparing user comprehension and recollection.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28317104">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28317104</a><p>HI Don (and Jack Gilmore),<p>Thanks for including me in this conversation.<p>I do not have a claim for the term “hyperlinks” and don’t know when it came into use. My claim is for the visual interface for showing highlighted selectable links embedded in paragraphs. This is what we called embedded menu items in that I think is an influential paper on the topic, which was peer-reviewed and published in the CACM in April 1986.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;5684.5687" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;5684.5687</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;~ben&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Koved1986Embedded.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;~ben&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Koved1986Embedded.pdf</a><p>While Engelbart had shown a list that could be selected by pointing and clicking in 1968, I claim the idea of embedded highlighted selectable text in paragraphs. This was implemented by grad student Daniel Ostroff and described in:<p>Ewing J, Mehrabanzad S, Sheck S, Ostroff D and Shneiderman B (1986), &quot;An experimental comparison of a mouse and arrow-jump keys for an interactive encyclopedia&quot;, International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, Jan., 1986, Vol 24, pp. 29-45.<p>[Abstract] [BibTeX] [DOI]<p>Ostroff D and Shneiderman B (1988), &quot;Selection devices for users of an electronic encyclopedia: an empirical comparison of four possibilities&quot;, Information Processing and Management, Nov., 1988, Vol 24(6), pp. 665-680.<p>[Abstract] [BibTeX] [DOI]<p>I think the 1988 paper was the earlier study, but the publication took a while.<p>My students conducted more than a dozen experiments (unpublished) on different ways of highlighting and selection using current screens, e.g. green screens only permitted, bold, underscore, blinking, and I think italic(???). When we had a color screen we tried different color highlighted links. While red made the links easier to spot, user comprehension and recollection of the content declined. We chose the light blue, which Tim adopted.<p>His systems with embedded menus (or hot spots), where a significant user interface improvement over early systems such as Gopher. But Tim told me at the time that he was influenced by our design as he saw it in the Hypertext on Hypertext project that we used Hyperties to build for the July 1988 CACM that held the articles from the July 1987 Hypertext conference at the University of North Carolina. The ACM sold 4000 copies of our Hypertext on Hypertext disks.<p>Our history is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;hyperties&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;hcil&#x2F;hyperties&#x2F;</a><p>and the video is very helpful in showing the design we used, which is what I think Tim built on for his WWW prototypes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=29b4O2xxeqg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=29b4O2xxeqg</a><p>So in summary, I don’t know who coined hypertext, but I do think our work visual and interaction design was influential.<p>Our Hyperties system was picked up by Cognetics Corporation (around 1987) who made a modestly successful commercial run with it, doing dozens of corporate projects, most notably the Hewlett-Packard user manual for their Laserjet 4 was distributed as a Hyperties disk.<p>Hyperties was the name we shifted to after we got a stop and desist order from a lawyer because our TIES (The Interactive Encyclopedia System) conflicted with an existing product.

For example, mosaic plots (also known as Marimekko diagrams) use rectangular tilings to show joint distributions (i.e., most commonly they are essentially stacked column plots where the columns are of different widths). The main distinguishing feature of a treemap, however, is the recursive construction that allows it to be extended to hierarchical data with any number of levels. This idea was invented by professor Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human – Computer Interaction Lab in the early 1990s. [21][22] Shneiderman and his collaborators then deepened the idea by introducing a variety of interactive techniques for filtering and adjusting treemaps.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;~ben&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Johnson1991Tree.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.umd.edu&#x2F;~ben&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Johnson1991Tree.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treemapart.wordpress.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;treemapart.wordpress.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="38921692" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38921692" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bluGill</span><span>|</span><a href="#38920233">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38921116">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38920558">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38921692">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38921692">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To someone in Minnesota umd means university of Minnesota Duluth campus.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

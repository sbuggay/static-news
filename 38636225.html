Second, it&#x27;s not actually possible to replace the <i>entire</i> ring singularity with a non-singular object.<p>However, there is a different type of &quot;no singularity&quot; model in the literature, called a &quot;Bardeen black hole&quot; (among other things), in which there is not only no singularity, but no event horizon. What <i>appears</i> to us as an event horizon is actually just an apparent horizon--a surface where, locally, light cannot escape, but which will not <i>stay</i> that way forever; eventually it will evaporate away (by a process similar to Hawking radiation), and everything that was trapped inside will come back out (though in hugely scrambled form).

Such as placing a large mass on the fabric helps draw all other masses towards it. But it is also important to remember that this is an analogy and loses a lot of (important) nuance because it&#x27;s meant as a simplification to laymen.<p>There are many complexities that this type of model will not account for and it&#x27;s worth noting that higher dimensional geometries don&#x27;t &quot;play nice&quot;, in that your visual intuitions will mislead you. Such as the stretchy fabric model is a 2D spacetime fabric stretching into a 3rd dimension that is otherwise not accessible by those flatlanders who experience a pulling force but do not see where that fabric is stretching into. Similarly we can not think of a black hole (or any mass) as a 3 dimensional version of a hold because it is &quot;stretching&quot; into higher dimensions, but the result of this distortion is the gravitational force we feel. Even this is a great oversimplification. If it helps you can think instead think of gravity as an inter-dimensional spaghetti monster that invisibly grabs everything and the closer you are to it the harder it is able to pull (just like you!). That might help remind you that the analogy is incomplete and unrealistic at some level.<p>I&#x27;d generalize the abstracted phenomena here and make sure that when anyone is listening to a scientific explanation they understand that it is incomplete (compared to the level of current understanding or prevailing hypotheses&#x2F;theories). Truth has a lower limit in complexity and often the complexity is rather high. Physicists __love__ simple theories (they call it &quot;elegant&quot;) and the whole goal is to make things as simple as possible. But obviously that threshold is rather high considering the level of math physicists do. So keep that in mind when hearing explanations because if it can be explained to your grandma, you&#x27;re losing a lot of information. Even if as distilled as possible. (Also, Einstein never said if you understand something you can explain it to a layman. Not sure where that came from but it is a silly notion without addendums akin to what has been said here)<p>So take analogies for what they are, but do not rely on them as complete or even &quot;good enough&quot; models. They&#x27;re explanatory aids, not explanations. Maybe scientists can do better on this, but it&#x27;s a tough job already and requiring being a scientific communicator (to the masses) is too high of an expectation. Scientists are still people too and our brains are small and time is limited.

Apologies if my question &quot;isn&#x27;t even wrong&quot;.<p>I have always had trouble reconciling the &quot;tidal stresses rip everything apart&quot; with the idea that &quot;everything hits the center in finite time, thus infinite density and singularity&quot;.<p>I mean, how can both be true?<p>My understanding is that tidal forces are due to the gravity gradient being more and more severe as you near the center. That is, objects just a little bit closer to the center than you will be pulled more, and hence will accelerate towards the center faster than you are being accelerated (at that moment). Relatively speaking, they are moving away from you. Eventually the gradient is so severe even your atoms even get ripped apart. Everything accelerates at faster and faster speeds.<p>This would imply that the &quot;space&quot; between matter increases indefinitely as you approach the center, right?<p>Also, does this also apply to photons in say a light ray? Do the photons nearer the center pull away from the photons further out? If not, why not? And if so, then how can this be possible if all photons travel at same speed C? Is it that space is expanding inside the event horizon, faster than the speed of light?<p>So anyhow, tidal forces seem to imply everything getting further and further apart from each other as you near the center.<p>But the idea of a singularity is that &quot;everything is in a single point of infinite density&quot;.<p>So how can matter be getting ripped apart at the same time it&#x27;s getting squooshed together?<p>Also, wouldn&#x27;t this apply to the original star that&#x27;s collapsing? Meaning the particles inside the star are getting ripped apart as the black hole forms and they&#x27;re drawn toward the center at faster and faster speeds. Is it possible that the particles in the star are also ripped apart by tidal forces, never reaching each other?<p>I guess my question is, what forces the particles back together again?

Is it possible that the particles in the star are also ripped apart by tidal forces, never reaching each other?<p>In that model, yes. If you take GR literally (and personally I wouldn&#x27;t), space itself is distorted and matter falling in falls infinitely far. (There is an argument that this itself prevents a true singularity from ever forming: there is an eternally collapsing pseudosingularity that is getting smaller and smaller and denser and denser, but the denser it is the more time-dilation it undergoes and so the collapse can never finish in finite time, at least for an outside observer).<p>&gt; Also, does this also apply to photons in say a light ray? Do the photons nearer the center pull away from the photons further out? If not, why not? And if so, then how can this be possible if all photons travel at same speed C? Is it that space is expanding inside the event horizon, faster than the speed of light?<p>You can&#x27;t really talk about photons in the context of GR, but yes, from the perspective of an infalling observer, light from an entity behind you gets increasingly redshifted and eventually the two of you are accelerating away from each other faster than light can reach, like a &quot;big rip&quot; in minature.<p>&gt; But the idea of a singularity is that &quot;everything is in a single point of infinite density&quot;.<p>&gt; So how can matter be getting ripped apart at the same time it&#x27;s getting squooshed together?<p>From the outside it&#x27;s a point. But from the inside it&#x27;s an infinitely large volume of space.

So we just see a big red shifted  
&quot;frozen in time&quot; black hole event horizon. Evaporates maybe in the future, but point is we never actually get a singularity on our side of the horizon.<p>&gt; From the inside, it&#x27;s an infinitely large volume.<p>This makes sense to me, more than a singularity existing. On the inside everything is ripped apart as space infinitely expands.<p>So doesn&#x27;t this imply there is no singularity on either side of the event horizon then?<p>It&#x27;s as if the &quot;wanting&quot; to be a singularity on our side of the horizon is countered&#x2F;balanced by frozen time. And on the other side of the horizon, from the particles point of view you can&#x27;t freeze time. So instead the singularity is countered by infinitely expanding space to prevent just this sort of thing from happening. Is this some sort of relativistic time&#x2F;space conservation law?<p>It&#x27;s like the extreme gravity trying to create a particle singularity just ends up expanding the space between the particles instead.  Hmmm. We know that at relativistic speeds, trying to accelerate a particle to C leads to time slowing down. In this case too much gravity trying to create a singularity leads to space expansion instead?<p>Are these just two sides to the same coin.

Two astronauts, a watcher and a faller, have two very different experiences.<p>Right, that&#x27;s sort of my point. If the experiences differ outside the event horizon, they must differ even more inside the horizon. Imagine Astronaut &quot;A&quot; who is closer to the horizon gets pulled in first, and is accelerating faster than Astronaut &quot;B&quot; outside the horizon.<p>Once A is inside the horizon, B can never interact with A again. I would assume this is true even after B crosses the horizon later on -- they both accelerate but tidal forces keep them moving further and further apart. Even though both are inside the horizon and heading in the same direction (center), at no point do they ever slow down or &quot;catch up&quot; to each other. B still can&#x27;t interact with A, as A was infinitely redshifted already. Would seem they&#x27;re always cutoff from each other.<p>&gt; I believe their wavelengths increase toward infinity. They don&#x27;t move more quickly away from one another but, rather, become red shifted.<p>Red shifted from the point of an observer looking towards the center of the black hole (anyone looking away from the center sees the outside universe blue shifted).<p>Red shifted light from far away stars implies an expanding universe. Wouldn&#x27;t red shifted light looking at the center of a black hole imply that the space between the observer and the center of the hole be increasing as well??<p>So increasing wavelength = increasing curvature = space expansion?<p>I guess my naïve interpretation is that, while you can never get out of the black hole (you can&#x27;t outrun the pull towards the center), at the same time you can never hit the center as things closer to it get further and further away from you. Would seem to me that there is expansion of space inside a black hole, maybe it&#x27;s this that prevents a true singularity from forming?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38638706" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38638706" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fallingfrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#38637365">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38636269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38638706">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38638706">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What confuses me about black holes is that they appear to break time symmetry.

    It is true that there are ”proofs” that the curvature of a non-rotating one is infinite at its central point.

    These all assume that matter is classical and that it satisfies whatever nineteenth century equation of state the proponents require to prove whatever it is that they wish to prove.

    Equations of state assume that all variables, such as pressure and volume, occur in the simplest algebraic fashion.

    This may be true for the low density laboratory or engineering experiments but perhaps not at black hole densities.

    The author has no doubt, and never did, that when Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are melded it will be shown that there are no singularities anywhere.

    When theory predicts singularities, the theory is wrong!

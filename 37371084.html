We&#x27;ve used an &quot;associate&quot; model for all that time - a posh way of saying &quot;a network of trusted freelancers&quot;.<p>We&#x27;ve deliberately chosen not to take on staff. We could have grown at many points along the way but haven&#x27;t wanted to. Instead we&#x27;ve stayed small, focused and profitable.<p>The benefits to growing would have been being able to take on bigger gigs, but we have always aimed for family first. The business has always been a means to a sustainable, balanced and loving family - and not an end.<p>I have friends who have taken the growth route. Some are doing ok. Others are desperately stressed. One has split from his wife in part because of the financial burden of maintaining a 5-10 person team.<p>We&#x27;ve never regretted taking the route we have. We have been here for our kids and we&#x27;ve been able to be flexible with our time in large part because we&#x27;re able to scale our own work up and down in response to changing times without having to worry about paying salaries.</div><br/><div id="37374346" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37374346" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gochi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37373632">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37373835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37374346">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37374346">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whatever the choice, it has to be deliberate. So many are people pleasers in disguise. They grow not because they actively choose, but because they can&#x27;t say no. It causes that desperately stressed life when you&#x27;re not active about these choices and boundaries. They&#x27;re always in survival mode, chasing more more more, without ever being deliberate and reflective about their actions.<p>It winds up being the end of a lot of businesses, whether or not they actually did grow. They took on a contract that was just too big for them, despite their intuition telling them not to. Or they hired too many people despite not wanting to but was talked into it by a friend.<p>So good on you for knowing what you want and being deliberate about it!

My primary complaint with solo-turned-agency people is how grifty they get.<p>As a solo, the job is to add value and make the customer happy so you build your reputation. There are definitely solo contractor grifters out there but they usually struggle with the reputation issue.<p>Agencies develop a grifty dynamic where they realize that their job is to sell themselves and as many headcount and hours as they can squeeze into a contract. Now instead of hiring that solo dev, they’re forcing you to pay 20 hours&#x2F;week to the project manager and to have two devs minimum on it, one or more of whom are complete juniors who will spend incredible amounts of hours solving simple problems, but that’s okay because that’s what they want.<p>Agencies rely on their status and size to impress clients, which short circuits the reputation issue and opens the door to these shenanigans. They also target bigger companies where wasting time and moving slowly might be the norm, or at least something they can gloss over by sending the sales people out to schmooze the execs over dinner again.<p>I knew some excellent devs and infosec people who turned into  agency operators who just tried to milk companies for contracts and run a revolving door of junior hires who they can squeeze hours from until they quit. It’s sad to see.<p>To be fair, I know a few good agencies as well. They tend to be in such high demand from reputation that they’re always booked without even trying.

If you’re paying someone 50th percentile compensation and demanding a 90th percentile work pace and output from them, you’re just going to have endless turnover as you burn people out.<p>Conversely, if you’re paying 90th percentile compensation and you have an employee moving at half the speed of their peers, eventually you’ll get fed up and replace them with someone better matched to the position.<p>But this all breaks down when you get into the weirder ends of the market. Self-pacing works great for you because you can put in the work to deliver $500K&#x2F;year of value and companies appreciate it. It doesn’t work for many people whose idea of a workday is to put in 1-2 hours of focus and then browse the internet all day, which is a larger portion of the developer population than I would have guessed before becoming a manager. Other people can’t help but wander through tasks, get distracted by rewrites or new frameworks, needlessly refactor working code, or otherwise do a lot of activity without producing a lot of work. Both of these fault modes benefit greatly from the pacing and structure of management.<p>There’s no one size fits all approach.

I feel the same way of more stamina doing my projects then what I do at work, but I feel like the blame, at least for me, can&#x27;t be attributed to school. Here is the reality, at least for me. I got into software engineering because I like to build really cool shit. The problem is, when people hire me, it usually isn&#x27;t for really cool shit. Its a business application, often with insane requirements because the client has no clue what they want or even why they really need it. When it does get figured out, its often just some boring business application with nothing really challenging to it or interesting. I&#x27;ll code it out, but there is nothing interesting about. But when I go home, I just do whatever I want. Want to build my own internet protocol built at a lower layer than TCP? Sure, sounds fun! But no one wants to pay me to do that, or the jobs that would pay me to do that are so far and few between.<p>If anything, school set me up with higher expectations. Here I am in college, doing interesting math problems and programming projects and such. I get out to the real world and boss man is just like, &quot;client just needs an application&#x2F;feature to do X,&quot; and the solution is just fetching the data, putting it in a list, and doing a for loop over it.

They turn to agencies because they don&#x27;t have the time or skills to do it themselves, and agencies are cheaper than hiring people and they are more dependable than freelancers.

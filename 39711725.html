Still 100% talking about hardware at the bottom and end user applications at the other end. But there is no discussion of the platform which to me is actually the highest value proposition Apple is bringing here.<p>In short: Apple has made a fully realized spatial operating system, while Meta has made an app launcher for immersive Unity&#x2F;Unreal apps for vanilla Android. You can get away with an app launcher when all you want to support is fully immersive apps that don&#x27;t talk to each other. But that fails completely if you are trying to build a true operating system.<p>Think about what has to exist, to say, intelligently copy and paste parts of a 3D object made by one application into a 3D object made by another, the same way you would copy a flat image from photoshop into a Word document. The operating system has to truly understand 3D concepts internally. Meta <i>is</i> building these features but it is stuck in a really weird space trying to wedge them in between Android underneath and Unity&#x2F;Unreal at the application layer. Apple has had the advantage of green field engineering it exactly how they want it to be from the ground up.</div><br/><div id="39724226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39724226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atoav</span><span>|</span><a href="#39721299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39721417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39724226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39724226">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And as an educator who thought an VR-development course at university for a few times since 2018 setting up and maintaining 15 Oculus Quest Mk I glasses was an absolute pain, with accounts that I have to setup, etc. Sure it worked somewhat like a android phone, but there was no real fast pass for users like me, a lot of the features and the UI changed over the time and it ultimately felt like the platform took itself too seriously and therefore had no problem wasting my time.<p>When designing a concept the core difference is always whether your design respects the user or whether it does not and tries to make them do things, spend more time on the platform, spend more money on the platform, etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39721417" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39721417" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdprgm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39721299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39724226">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39722929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39721417">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39721417">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This has been my main complaint with Oculus all the way since the Rift days.

The headset&#x27;s UI is basically a 2D desktop with taskbar and app launcher covering a small fraction of the field of view, including some buttons that are so small it&#x27;s tricky to aim at them with the controllers. The Oculus desktop client fails to recognize it via USB and the official remote desktop app is still in Beta while Steam lets me play games or use the desktop remotely with two button presses. To this day I have not managed to just copy files directly onto the device, no USB connection (other than to Steam) works. Only some semi-reliable wifi transfer from a third-party application worked but that required enabling developer mode.<p>On top of that they decided to ship it with a head strap that never fits well and gets painful within 30 minutes, and then made it unnecessarily complicated to swap. Yes, of course people aren&#x27;t going to do more on that thing than play a few rounds of Beat Saber, because many simply don&#x27;t want to jump through hoops like that.

But they also know that every aspect of the hardware will improve over the next decade, and as it does they will have ironed out many of the problems with how we use AR&#x2F;VR and will be ready for it, based on the real life experiences of actual owners, rather than years of in-house testing.<p>The screen will get bigger (I hear FoV is pretty poor at the moment), the CPU&#x2F;power&#x2F;thermal performance will improve, battery density goes up, cameras and sensors get better and cheaper and many parts will get smaller&#x2F;lighter. And in that time they will learn by doing, making it better&#x2F;cheaper&#x2F;lighter and working on the software and interaction model.<p>Hopefully at the same time it will really spur on the rest of the industry and we will see more competition and experimentation.<p>I can&#x27;t see myself buying something like this for the next 10 years at least.

It took a little experimenting to avoid hard pressure points, and then make it comfortable.<p>It is now very comfortable with the following benefits:<p>1. The field of view is noticeably wider. Yay! The immersion improvement feels cognitively significant.<p>2. I realized that greater peripheral vision downward is more important than upward. Being more aware of down makes us feel safer and is also where are our hands and keyboards live.<p>So I arranged the padding to wear the head set slightly lower, allocating all the increased vertical FOV downward.<p>3. The combination of being 1&#x2F;4 inch or so closer to the face, and firmer padding, reduced the feeling of weight on the front of my head.<p>Warning - literally. I get an occasional popup warning that my eyes are too close to the lenses. The danger being if I were to fall I could potentially hit my eyes. I stay seated most the time, but occasionally walk through rooms, so it is worth being careful.<p>I use my Vision Pro for 10 hours a day on many days, comfortably. I had to switch to the two-strap support to do this. But I have ordered an adapter that allows the original behind the heat cushion strap to be used with a second cushion strap over the head. I anticipate that working even better, given how much surface area weight will be distributed across. (Also turning a knob is easier for adjustments than messing with velcro.)<p>Also, got some thicker (in width) lighter foam, to add some more light seal around the edges.<p>This feels like a real upgrade, a year or so before Apple will release a bump.</div><br/><div id="39720190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39720190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cyberpunk</span><span>|</span><a href="#39715993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39719840">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39720304">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39720190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39720190">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Genuine question, what are you doing for 10 hours a day in there?<p>Can you comfortable code all day in that?

I have a 98&quot; monitor with two 55&quot; monitors in portrait angled towards me on either side (heights all match), all wall mounted. Truly wonderful! But this has replaced that for me.<p>I have even considered beheading a MacBook Pro.<p>I love the following:<p>• Never needing to put on or take off reading glasses to see far, or within inches.<p>• I can have my main Mac &quot;screen&quot; whatever size I want, typically large. Also that I can lean into it when focusing on a patch of code, and it always looks perfect.<p>• Having multiple Vision safari screens, or utilities, surrounding me. With the look and pinch interface being very nice for navigating.<p>• Being able to tune out 180 degrees of my space with a natural scene so I am completely undistracted. Wish I could go 360 degrees, and still leave keyboard visible. (Either by having an unobstructed low circle, or having the keyboard &quot;punch through&quot; like hands do.<p>• Flexible screen position lets me sit with great posture all the time.  I tend to pull right up to my desk, push my keyboard far out and lean forward on my elbows a bit. Have the screen large but close enough that I can lean in to focus on something.<p>• Two environments in one! I will put project organization and context notes on huge screens behind me on a wall. Personal mission control. In thoughtful moments I get out of my chair, walk around the room and see the large screens from anywhere, walk right up to it, make small edits with pinch and zoom.<p>• The incredible ergonomics of being able to code comfortably in bed, on a couch, recliner, etc. with good ergonomics, due to the screens being flexibly placed. Being able to code in many places keeps my brain fresh.<p>• I use a holster for the battery. Geeky, but after dropping it as I walked away from my desk 100 times I realized I need that. That elminated inhibitions about moving, and feelings of being chained down.<p>• I haven&#x27;t been in flow so consistently for so many hours for a long time. For me the Mac interface expansion&#x2F;isolation chamber IS what Vision is for.<p>Issues:<p>• As noted, wish the keyboard and my drinks would &quot;punch through&quot; 360 degree scenes, or there was an optional lower circle of punch rough.<p>• Keyboard and trackpad pointer are fussy when switching between Mac and Vision screens.<p>• Wish I could have more Mac screens, and drag Mac windows out to their own screens. Also pull in iPad and iPhone screens. And push windows&#x2F;app-states back out to those machines too. Or two other people&#x27;s devices.<p>• Wish the Mac screen operated with look and pinch. I do this a few times every day when in flow.<p>• Wish I could disconnect&#x2F;reconnect my MacBook Pro screen. The headless MacBook Pro for Vision would be absolutely great. But having the option to use it as a laptop too would be great. Maybe remove my MacBook screen, but set it up so I can clip my iPad Pro to it too?<p>• Need a Vision Spaces interface for setting up work then moving to a different context, but being able to come back to those screens. Being able to set up a space that is location sensitive, so always available in that room, seat, whatever.</div><br/><div id="39723104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39723104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mindentropy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39715993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39721972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39722476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39723104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39723104">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I have a 98&quot; monitor with two 55&quot; monitors in portrait angled towards me on either side (heights all match), all wall mounted.<p>What are these 98&quot; monitors?

I guess what I want to understand is why is Apple kind of all alone on that plot, where the rest of the industry are clustered together far away from them? What are the business processes that lead to their position? Can a company follow  a playbook and change their culture and have similar results? Are there other examples?<p>A lot of our industry are so extremely risk averse, have tunnel vision trying to copy each others’ feature checkboxes, rush things to market to try to make money before they are fully baked, and then give up when they aren’t instant successes.

Before my first MBP, I had a Dell Inspiron which has good specs, but it was heavy, the plastic was flimsy and the screen was not good. The trackpad was abysimal. In my last work position, I got a Dell XPS and it was the same, so in the span of 8 years, nothing changes to show that they care for me as a user.<p>Most people don’t want to think about how to do something or care about optimizing it when they can get it done and not think further about it. But companies seems to want to put a lot of barriers into what I want to get done, like popups, complicated screens, ugly interfaces. For the majority of user workflows, Apple offers a simple, unobstrusive way to do them. Starlink routers are almost the same in that regard (the mobile app could use some work, and perhaps add a desktop interface)<p>My advice (as a user) is for to simplify the usual workflow to the point you only ask the few (0,1-3) indispensable questions, and then get out of the way. Further options can be buried inside Preferences and Settings. And then you perfect the apperance, ease of use, and general enjoyment of using the application&#x2F;device.</div><br/><div id="39720247" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39720247" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WWLink</span><span>|</span><a href="#39715993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39719052">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39723222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39720247">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39720247">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Apple makes devices for the users.

Reality is actually quite simple: they spot technology advances, and integrate them into a neat, well-designed package that people actually want to buy.<p>The first iPod was a fancy shell around an IBM 1.8&#x27;&#x27; hard drive. There were MP3 players before but they were very bulky, or could store only a handful of files. They saw the hard drive coming, did the math, and went all in.<p>Same thing with the iPhone: there were smart phones before, but they spotted the capacitive digitizer that was orders of magnitude more accurate than the competition, and boom, multitouch.<p>Same thing with the AirPods: the killer feature being their fancy Bluetooth chip, which made the experience much better than the competition that was established for a decade at that point.<p>It is quite interesting that they do it over and over, going as far as saying what they do in interviews, and some people really don&#x27;t see it for what it is.<p>&gt; Are they the only ones who can create products?<p>They are not. They just have a vision of what they want to do, and once they start they put the effort needed (sometimes killing advanced designs before release). Then, they iterate relentlessly generation after generation. They play the long game, and often introduce their first generations at higher price points and keep improving and driving their price points down even if it is not an initial resounding success. Any company can do it, if they take design seriously and optimise for long term strategic goals rather than short-term economics.<p>&gt; Competitors work for ages and ages fighting each other, refining v1, v2, v2.1, v2.2, v2.25, and then suddenly Apple comes out with something v8-ish and the whole industry scrambles.<p>If you look closely, when Apple comes in, it&#x27;s because they have found a differentiating factor that they think will make the difference. They always have a compelling message about why you should choose their product above the competition.

No they are not.<p>This is <i>your</i> personal opinion. My personal opinion, is very much the opposite.<p>&gt; The reason they are regarded as a more premium option in the market is not because they make less product with more profit margin, its because they have had an incredibly clever marketing department for the last 20 years meticulously curating their brand presence and public perception into being the most premium tech company which produces the best products.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this same boring claim now for about 20 years. It was wrong as a broad statement twenty years ago, and such a statement I would hazard is still wrong now.<p>I&#x27;ve had a twenty year career in IT. Starting with PC repair and working for a PC OEM, however the vast majority of my career has been spent in fields involving Linux. (Linux Administrator&#x2F;Systems Engineering&#x2F;DevOPS through to executive leadership). I know how computers work, I know how the hardware works, I know the relative value of parts that go into things, yes I can, always have, and still will build machines including using on a regular basis all major operating systems in place today and despite all of this, I still remain an Apple customer and its not because im some dumbo non technical individual tricked by apples fancy marketing voodoo.<p>It&#x27;s because for those twenty years Apple has consistently conducted themselves in a way with <i>me</i> personally that for the vast majority of cases, has served <i>me</i> best as a user and as their customer. As opposed to some third party who is paying them to exploit me through their operating system or some mass of adware shipped with their operating system, not just this years profit margins, not just for as long as im in the store and to which afterwards im left alone once ive paid them with a &quot;fuck you, got mine.&quot;<p>Just a few of the events of the past twenty years that have kept me as an apple customer:<p>* 2006ish era macbook. HDD dies at random just outside of warranty. No local apple stores at the time. Local authorised repairer spends two weeks dicking me around on a fix, nothing. I push it to Apple who was not even local at the time. A week later I have a <i>BRAND NEW</i> macbook, not just a drive, outside of warranty, complete with brand new warranty, an additional year tacked on top and an apology for the service I had received. (We now have apple stores so this would not occur again I imagine.)<p>* 2014ish iPhone. Much like the macbook I start having issues outside of warranty, it is unable to be debugged in store. Dude wanders away, comes back. &quot;Have you got a backup?&quot;, &quot;Yes?&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ll just give you a refurb, newer model, with warranty, are you happy with that?&quot; &quot;lol, yes I am.&quot;<p>* 2012 15&quot; MacBook pro retina battery replacement - Battery dies outside of warranty in around 2017 and im informed no stock currently exists in the country, and that i&#x27;ll be waiting months if I wanted a replacement. I am immediately informed that if I do not want to wait, I can instead have a significantly more powerful, and higher specced refurb model, complete with brand new warranty in place of waiting the month for a replacement. I took the replacement. Again, this machine was OUTSIDE of the warranty window. That one retina MBP purchase due to this replacement saw my laptop needs covered for a decade.<p>This is only touching on a tiny amount of the circumstances that have led to me remaining to continue investigating the purchase of products from Apple. Not everyone will have had these interactions, or come away from Apple positively, and perhaps one day, I also will not and my opinions will change. But at this point, from the day I became a customer through now, I have received a better long term support experience as a customer from Apple, then I have from any other organisation on the planet.</div><br/><div id="39722649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39722649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnfong</span><span>|</span><a href="#39715993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39721854">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39724131">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39722649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39722649">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &gt; Are their products more reliable, more fully featured, and objectivley better than their competitiors?

The google engineer nerds couldn&#x27;t understand why no one liked their product: it had all these options for uploading video with the best quality and all these formats, while youtube had worse quality and few options. They missed the point and didn&#x27;t understand the users, and were caught up in the tech rather than what was actually valuable to the users (basically: dead simple to &#x27;just upload a video&#x27; - quality doesn&#x27;t matter as much as that).<p>Kinda like how Mark Z. has been talking about how the Oculus has similar resolution. It&#x27;s not the tech specs that make the product - those are necessary but not sufficient. If the product is supposed to be AR: then it needs to actually be AR. And that means. e.g., that details like virtual shadows on real surfaces MUST be included, and must actually work properly. If it&#x27;s not, then it&#x27;s only kinda-AR.

They get all of the iOS media and peripheral handling capability &quot;for free&quot;. Both projects can focus on TV or speaker features since the base OS is largely a solved problem for them. If they need some special consideration from somewhere in SWE they just file a Radar. They don&#x27;t just get binary blob dumps of firmware from outside vendors and have to beg for bug fixes and hope their contract is big enough to get some consideration.<p>The Vision Pro leverages their ARM SoCs, base OS, and all the motion coprocessors that have been in their phones and watches for a decade. Novel improvements from the Vision Pro&#x27;s development will just feed back to those components and make it into the next phone, watch, or whatever.<p>Most other companies don&#x27;t actually own their whole product stack. Even Microsoft is at the mercy of their suppliers with the Surface line. They get what Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD have to offer. Smartphone manufacturers are grabbing Qualcomm and Samsung SoCs which are collections of Cortex cores then slap Android on top hoping that Google&#x27;s latest version is better than the previous version.<p>It&#x27;s hard to really make leapfrog products when you&#x27;re shipping the same shit as your competitors and trying to compete on price.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39717576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39717576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lotsofpulp</span><span>|</span><a href="#39715993">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39716690">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39723453">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39718940">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39717576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39717576">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Is it just the vast amount of money?<p>No, it is the vast amount of risk they are willing to take.

All the innovations in Google Maps are kind of tied up in backend technologies that aren&#x27;t specific to the phone at all, indeed predated it.<p>Once they figured out touchscreen keyboard and accelerated web browsing sort of everything else fell into place.

Time will tell. Beatsaber is an innovative game but it leaned on the basic premise of people doing something illegal, uploading non licensed maps and tracks.<p>Hacker News commenters don&#x27;t know much about making games - even when they work for huge game studios! - and they don&#x27;t know much about VR - even when they work at companies making VR headsets!<p>Hugo must certainly be aware of the Varjo XR3, which is actually the most comparable device to the AVP and even more expensive, but there were developers at Apple on the AVP team who never heard of it, and many more Oculus developers.<p>At the end of the day this is a love letter to halo product positioning coupled with relentless vendor lock-in applied to helpless consumers.

Technology isnt a zero sum game, but I genuinely believe the impact will be bigger than AI. AI changes the way you work, Apple Vision will change the way you live, which will change the things you consume, which will impact the work that needs to be done to serve you. Empires will rise and fall. Travel to beaches will go up, travel to tier 3 towns and cities with minor attractions could get obliterated. Most TVs will disappear. My grand children will be able to experience memories with me long after I&#x27;m dead. After this, looking at my smartphone seems so analog. Anyway, I could go on for hours<p>Lastly, on the topic of pricing, there is a great book titled Positioning by Al Reiss that highlights the rational behind Apple&#x27;s strategy on pricing. They are a second mover in this space, they needed to come out of the gate as the absolute gold standard of this technology and position it as the best money can buy. They delivered on both the tech and pricing. Long after the price comes down, they&#x27;ll still own that position of being the best money can buy. When you own the position, it takes a lot to lose it. It will be almost impossible for Meta to take that from them now.

You can make something in a category but until it passes that threshold it doesn’t really change the world.

It makes you want to rip your headset off and just use your laptop&#x2F;tablet (and I&#x27;m aware they can act as companions, but at that point...why do you need the headset?). I just don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s going to change anytime soon. There also -are- physical limitations, for one, it&#x27;s exhausting to wear for extended periods. You have absolutely no peripheral vision, and how is that going to be solved? Even if you made it light, unless it&#x27;s as light as a pair of glasses, it&#x27;s not going to be something I want to put on for several -hours- a day. You can&#x27;t walk away from it; you have to physically remove it.<p>The best move imo, for VR&#x2F;AR is as a &quot;background&quot; tech, it can physically remove us from our devices and shouldn&#x27;t be a new fully fledged computer I&#x27;m putting on my face. You also have to understand that generations after Millennials are steadily enjoying -less- &quot;in your face&quot; things, and I think that&#x27;s the right. I think the future is going to look a lot more like &quot;Her&quot; and a lot less like &quot;Ready Player One,&quot; at least on the mass market.<p>This can change in 30-50 years, but right now?

It&#x27;d be like trying to use a PS5 for work. I kind of get why they did it but I hate it.

I actually try to use my Rift-S with my desktop for certain activities almost daily. I press the right controller&#x27;s system button, close the home tab, close the library tab, close the store tab, open the desktop. Then I interact with the a few desktop apps. I copy or move files and I run certain apps that I&#x27;ve written that work reasonably well with point and click controls<p>But, I tried accessing my desktop on a Quest via the various link (wired and wireless) and it crashed 1 of 3 times.

The more productivity I can do on a Quest the more useful it is it me any many others. There are more phones than game consoles.

Watching TV&#x2F;movies in virtual reality seemed like such an incredibly compelling idea that we (the Oculus team at Meta&#x2F;Facebook) built an entire product around that idea — Oculus Go. Launched in 2018, Oculus Go was the biggest product failure I’ve ever been associated with for the simple reason that it had extremely low retention despite strong partnerships with Netflix and YouTube. Most users who bought Oculus Go completely abandoned the headset after a few weeks.<p>You can&#x27;t possibly extrapolate the movie watching retention rate from Oculus Go to Apple Vision Pro. That&#x27;s like saying most people won&#x27;t use ipod based on the data we collected from our walkman.</div><br/><div id="39716531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39716531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taeric</span><span>|</span><a href="#39716055">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39721161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39716531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39716531">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know.

Understanding now that they really tried and it failed hard at Oculus previously adds a lot of insight to that.<p>I do have to say, for me it does add up to one huge missing element for Vision Pro: why Apple didn&#x27;t ship some kind of co-presence features on day 1 is totally baffling to me. I think it likely stems from the fact they clearly missed their mark with Personas and presumably they didn&#x27;t want to then introduce cartoon style avatars like Meta did. They&#x27;ve decided to die on the hill of realistic avatars and they are actually dying there. It means people hate Personas, they don&#x27;t have co-presence which is damaging the media viewing and preventing a lot of the AR and professional use cases from developing where co-presence is also a must, sometimes the primary feature.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to me because Apple pitched so hard at their headset not being socially isolating, but they ultimately created the most socially isolating headset of all.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39716179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39716179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mliker</span><span>|</span><a href="#39716055">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39721161">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39716184">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39716179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39716179">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed, I&#x27;ve had my Vision Pro for a month, and I still use it to watch shows&#x2F;movies and as my portable external display.

You can&#x27;t just blindly walk around in your room without falling over things, so movement is highly unnatural in VR unless you&#x27;re in a cockpit.

It forces change if I adopt it, which I don&#x27;t appreciate, and worse I might be compelled to change if it becomes a normal part of life - if it&#x27;s necessary competitively or to sufficiently fit into society (e.g., smartphones).<p>So it&#x27;s the old story: First I laugh at it (we seem past that for VR); second I say it conflicts with the orthodoxy (my established life, in this case); and third, someday, I&#x27;ll say I knew it all along. :)<p>I&#x27;m kinda in the second stage, and maybe you are too? As a technologist - that is, as someone whose job is to evaluate and adapt new technologies - I can&#x27;t afford to indulge that 3-step cycle or I will be giving people advice based on those instincts (1. &#x27;that&#x27;s ridiculous&#x2F;vaporware&#x2F;useless, don&#x27;t worry about it&#x27;, 2. &#x27;it&#x27;s not compatible&#x2F;applicable for your business&#x27;, 3. &#x27;it&#x27;s what everyone is doing!&#x27;) and fail to be ahead of the curve. Plus, those instincts limit me as a person. So I&#x27;ve needed to learn to recognize that cycle and not act on it, but to evaluate new tech on its own merits.<p>That turns out to be hard even after lots of practice - it&#x27;s hard to ignore all the instinct and the constant signals from everyone else, and think for yourself. We&#x27;re social animals. So it&#x27;s hard to imagine the killer, high value apps until they are out there, until everyone else signals their value. But some that stand out as possibilities to me:<p>- AR: Data and metadata on things in the world around me. It seems especially good for work with physical objects: Showing me their specs, diagrams of how they should look, alternate perspectives. Imagine working on your car with AR.<p>- 3-D VR work rooms: A room with all of your electronic documents, videos, applications, etc. for a project. Also you can have virtual objects - the live control panel from the router, copies of the physical object you are designing, etc.  The room can be as large as you want. It seems especially great for teams, where people can bring in documents and objects to share and work on together with everyone else. This seems so much better than current collaboration.<p>- Presence at things like sporting events: Seats right on the sideline or even views from the field itself: Watch Messi&#x27;s dribbling and goal form the goalie&#x27;s perspective. Watch the pitch from the batter&#x27;s perspective (or the referee&#x27;s, for those controversial calls). Also for theater, etc.<p>- 3-D, immersive films and games, of course. Art seems to have great potential, but will need some time to develop, as artists learn the nuances of the medium (and as only games get funding).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39721455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39721455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempestn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39715901">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39718000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39721455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39721455">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Less so in a scene like this intimate music concert or sports game, but probably a lot more so in dramatic storytelling and <i>other types of more realistic films</i>.<p>Presumably he has a specific type of film in mind here.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39718000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39718000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nottorp</span><span>|</span><a href="#39721455">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39720830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39718000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39718000">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What we got wrong at Oculus that Apple got right<p>Hmm so basically they say Apple massively overengineered it and doesn&#x27;t expect to sell it to more than 3 people at that price, which is right.<p>But Occulus has been owned by Facebook for a long time now, what stopped them?<p>They could at least have an aspirational &quot;research&quot; device that they sold for 5000, in addition to the semi-affordable (minus privacy concerns) stuff.</div><br/><div id="39718109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39718109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kjkjadksj</span><span>|</span><a href="#39718000">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39720830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39718109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39718109">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What stopped oculus was the realities of a headset.

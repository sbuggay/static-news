In the wake of the &#x27;08 financial crisis, I&#x27;d lost my job abruptly and decided to go travelling.<p>I&#x27;d accumulated a balance that was fairly substantial for me at the time (on the order of $10-15k, IIRC) and had been struggling to make the payments. I&#x27;d probably been 2-3 months behind on multiple occasions over the course of a year or so when a letter appeared that essentially said &quot;we don&#x27;t like you and we&#x27;re going to close your account and pass your debt to a collection agency. However, if you pay off a portion of your balance in 4 monthly payments, and don&#x27;t miss any of those payment dates, we&#x27;ll wipe the rest.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t recall exactly what the discount was, but it was very substantial. In total I only had to pay something like 30-40% of the balance that I owed, so it was a very good deal. I&#x27;m not normally one to skip out on my debts but this was a huge relief to have a chance to be free of that debt: I pulled a lot of strings to make those payments on time!<p>True to their word, they wiped my entire balance and closed my account, and I never heard from them again (nor any collection agencies).</div><br/><div id="37493369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37493369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worldwidelies</span><span>|</span><a href="#37492958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37493577">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37493369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37493369">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">same experience, except it wasn&#x27;t that simple.

This is one for the history books of borked equilibriums. We devoted substantial efforts to pro-consumer legislation to address abuse of (mostly) poor people. We gated redress behind labor that is abundantly available in the professional managerial class and scarce outside of it, like writing letters and counting to 30 days. (People telling me they were incapable of doing these two things is why I started ghostwriting letters for debtors.) We now have literal computer programs exempting heuristically identified professional managerial class members from debt collection, inclusive of their legitimate debts, so that debt collectors can more profitably conserve their time to do abusive and frequently illegal shakedowns of the people the legislation was meant to benefit.<p>That is such a common pattern.  Growing up, I saw the same happen with the German welfare system: there&#x27;s enough of a social safety net in that country that no one would have to be homeless.  But, to access the social safety net, you have to navigate some minimal amount of bureaucracy and paperwork.<p>That bar isn&#x27;t very high, but if you have at least that minimal skill with paperwork literacy, you are also much more likely to have a job and much less likely to need the welfare.<p>So all in all, Germany still has homeless people, despite welfare programs generous enough in principle that no one needs to be homeless.<p>Addendum: Singapore has an ingenious system to ration the amount of subsidies you get on hospital bills without any bureaucracy.  The basic idea is that when you go for a hospital stay, you get to pick how much etxra creature comforts you are getting, like your own private room vs an open word with many beds.  The copay for the fancier options rises &#x27;progressively&#x27; enough, that the absolute amount of government subsidy goes down.  People tend to self-sort voluntarily.<p>The medical care you receive is the same for any of the options.<p>I can imagine an argument that this is somehow against the dignity of poor people to put them into comparatively crowded wards, and that everyone should get the same treatment (like eg the British NHS does, modulo the option to go to a private hospital for enough money).  But I suspect many of the poorer people are happier to put up with that &#x27;indignity&#x27; than with paperwork and privacy-invading bureaucratic means testing.<p>In total, adding up private and public expenditures, Singapore spends about half as much on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than the UK does, which spends about half as much as the US.  Medical outcomes are no worse in the cheaper systems.</div><br/><div id="37492157" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492157" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">repiret</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491519">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491774">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492157">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492157">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A little over a decade ago I knew a young adult in the US that had a pretty rough life and I was trying to help her get back on her feet.<p>When you’re homeless, it’s hard to get mail, and hard to keep your stuff; going from nothing to your standard documents is tricky.<p>To get your birth certificate, you need to write a check to the state at some address where you’ll be able to receive mail in 2-4 weeks.<p>Once you have that, you can go into the social security office and request a replacement social security card. Which they’ll mail to you in 2-4 weeks. There’s also a lifetime limit to how many times you can replace your card, which is surprisingly small.<p>State ID cards also get mailed to you. Moreover, you need to provide proof of your address, and the address gets printed on the card.  We used my address, but no good deed goes unpunished - the address on your ID card gets published in the paper when you’re arrested.  Then my nosy neighbor asks if everyone is alright because someone living at my house got arrested for possession of meth.<p>On top of each of those steps costing money and being hard to do when you’re homeless, there’s a dependency chain. You got to do them one at a time.<p>Navigating the public bureaucracy is an annoyance for someone in what patio11 calls the professional&#x2F;managerial class.

I scheduled a colonoscopy with a hospital.  They charged me $300 for the procedure, which I paid up front. Everything went smoothly and there were no delays, complications, or followups.  A week later they sent me a bill for over $1k.  They had not applied my $300 payment towards the total.  They had not waited for insurance to reimburse them.  They simply decided they could arbitrarily charge me more, and they did.  Fortunately, my wife is somewhat familiar with medical billing and we did not pay.  Insurance reimbursed them, then we called them and told them to apply the $300 we had already paid, at which point we owed nothing.  If we had paid the $1k+ bill, I am sure we would not have been reimbursed.<p>2. I went to a clinic for a minor sports injury.  They charged me a $60 consultation fee which I paid up front; I then spoke to the doctor for 15 minutes and got a prescription.  A week later, I got a bill demanding an additional $180, and in that bill they claimed they had already been paid by my insurance.  I checked with my insurance provider and found they had not even filed the claim yet.  I ignored the bill, insurance reimbursed them, and they have not contacted me since.<p>Your characterization is ignorant of how scummy medical billing actually is.</div><br/><div id="37492606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OrvalWintermute</span><span>|</span><a href="#37490662">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491671">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Your characterization is ignorant of how scummy medical billing actually is.<p>Concur completely.

Developers simply like writing code more than they like writing documentation, and they like writing documentation more than they like maintaining old codebases. Meanwhile, software vendors of all kinds have universally decided that they shouldn&#x27;t be spending any money on any form of technical support that comes with a heartbeat.<p>Down in the home and small-business markets, there are a <i>lot</i> of people that get absolutely screwed by this. New software comes out, something tries to auto-update (or the user is forced to update), something goes sideways, and ... that&#x27;s it. Stuck. Nobody to call. Some really sharp Google skills once upon a time could sometimes find an answer, but even that&#x27;s thoroughly rotted out now.<p>So if your small business has your entire customer database in an old version of Quickbooks running on the office PC with Windows 7 configured by the last tech to stop complaining about updates, and then one day Quickbooks refuses to launch and displays instead an obtuse error message ... what do you do? For a while, you could call me, and for several years, I mostly enjoyed building a business out of fixing these sorts of things (and helping people navigate the sometimes very tricky update process so that this wouldn&#x27;t be a recurring problem).<p>Unfortunately, software kept getting worse, documentation kept getting harder to come by, Google kept getting worse, everything kept getting converted into subscription SaaS (which meant that most of my answers started becoming, &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s just how it works now, I can&#x27;t do anything about it, yeah, it sucks, yeah, lots of other people are complaining too, no, there&#x27;s nobody you can call, sorry&quot;), and I never felt good charging a lot of money for getting people out of bad spots.<p>I eventually noped out of this in favor of relaxing for a while in a slightly less hopeless part of the industry, but there&#x27;s still a huge, under-served market of people who are getting hosed by sociopathic technology and would pay someone just to make it work again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37491709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37491709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aperocky</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492949">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491318">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37491709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37491709">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Microservices</div><br/></div></div><div id="37491318" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37491318" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">verve_rat</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491709">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37491318">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37491318">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Burnt out developers?<p>Start ups that could have been viable small&#x2F;medium business but were scaled to death?</div><br/><div id="37491379" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37491379" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NineStarPoint</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491283">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37491379">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37491379">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also businesses that could have been profitable, but failed due to being out competed by businesses that secured 10X the venture capital and sold things at unsustainable prices for years.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37492156" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492156" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">expertentipp</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491318">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37491353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492156">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492156">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Angular and corporate Java codebases with &gt;95% test coverage.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37491353" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37491353" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kibwen</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491283">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492156">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492153">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37491353">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37491353">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s the thing, the software industry <i>is</i> the waste processor of open-source software development.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37492153" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492153" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adev_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37491283">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37490492">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492153">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492153">[58 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It might be a very European view to the problem but: Why does the American government does even tolerate this credit card garbage business in the first place ?<p>We are in the 21th century.

So that might actually be a better fix than enshrining yet more &#x27;customer rights&#x27; in law, that only the literate classes who know how to navigate bureaucracy can actually enjoy.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37492302" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492302" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">logN_2</span><span>|</span><a href="#37492153">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492277">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492302">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492302">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why have the money taken out of my bank account for a purchase made today when I can pay it without penalty 60 days later and let the money grow in my brokerage account.<p>Along with the usual answers like cash bank&#x2F;points&#x2F;consumer protection, it also decouples spending from &quot;pay day&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37492282" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492282" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">uoaei</span><span>|</span><a href="#37492153">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492302">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492282">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492282">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Three letters: GDP<p>The economy functions &quot;better&quot; (for a very specific definition of the word) when people can spend money they don&#x27;t have.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37492191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37492191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sixothree</span><span>|</span><a href="#37492153">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492282">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37492172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37492191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37492191">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t know the answer to your questions.

I was studying sign language and she is deaf. She told us growing up in the old days they didn&#x27;t had specialized schools for deaf people (since they could read?!) so she attended regular school and was not doing ok. She struggled a lot until she finally got the attention that she needed from a teacher who was able to instruct her in sign language (which believe you or not is Brazil&#x27;s second official language). Before that she told us she was not able to have complex thoughts. She didn&#x27;t know her father had a name, for instance. She thought his &quot;name&quot; was daddy. She is a brilliant woman and I&#x27;m glad I attended her class and also, that she was able to find someone who helped her, growing up.</div><br/><div id="40479812" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40479812" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kqr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479185">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40479812">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40479812">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">James Gleick in <i>The Information</i> also describes cases of the effect of traditional literacy on complexity&#x2F;abstraction of thought.<p>He claims that literacy is nearly a prerequisite for things like zeroth-order logical reasoning and understanding of abstract shapes. Two examples he gives:<p>- Some illiterate people are told that all bears in the north are white, that Greenland is a country in the north, then they are asked what colours bears in Greenland have. They answer, &quot;Different regions have differently coloured bears. I haven&#x27;t been to Greenland. But I have seen a brown bear.&quot;<p>I would have said, &quot;Based on the information you gave me, I would guess white.&quot;<p>- When shown a rectangle and asked what shape it is some illiterate answer things like &quot;a door&quot; or &quot;a playing card&quot; but struggle to find things doors and playing cards have in common.<p>I go to the abstract shapes immediately when I&#x27;m shown drawings by my son. It&#x27;s almost at a point where it feels like my logical&#x2F;abstract reasoning stands in the way of creativity.<p>----<p>But I don&#x27;t know how much this is personality (I happen to have a knack for logical&#x2F;abstract reasoning and I happened to learn to read when I was very young) and how much is an effect of reading. After all, anthropologists are great at the concrete rather than abstract, but maybe they get lots of training in it. I&#x27;ve also heard the Japanese are better at it.<p>TFA clearly postulates it has more to do with the kind of vocabulary, or maybe it&#x27;s on an increasing scale with more language.</div><br/><div id="40480319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40480319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abdullahkhalids</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479185">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40480120">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40480319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40480319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I checked the reference.

I.e. cultures with a high degree of literacy train their children in logic and abstraction; primarily oral cultures do not.<p>The hen and the egg problem is obvious here, of course. Does writing lead to logic, or does an emphasis on logic necessitate learning writing?

Based on what we know about the stages of infant brain development, they clearly possess the ability to create abstractions so my intuition would be that they can form abstractions, they may just not be culturally useful (i.e. idiosyncratic and thus not helpful in communication).<p>Children are literally taught &quot;this is a triangle, here is an object shaped like a triangle, can you see anything else in this room&#x2F;picture that&#x27;s shaped like a triangle&quot; (along with squares, circles, etc) and it will initially take them a while to recognize objects having that shape, even when it seems &quot;obvious&quot; to adults. This makes sense given that &quot;things shaped like a triangle&quot; is not a useful category during childhood development otherwise and instead mostly useful as a cultural aid (i.e. something you can reference in communication with others and establishing a basis for discussion of more complex shapes like pyramids).<p>Just like &quot;basic&quot; shapes, &quot;logic&quot; is something that&#x27;s mostly useful on a cultural level even if most people are likely not explicitly taught the basics of formal logic at an early age.<p>To go back to the example: if you tell me all bears in the north are white and Greenland is in the north but I&#x27;ve never been to Greenland and all bears I&#x27;ve seen are brown, it&#x27;s still a good heuristic to assume that bears in Greenland are brown because I don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re saying is true on a literal level. Maybe Greenland is not as far up north as the place where bears are white or maybe you just saw a white bear (or another white animal you mistook for a bear) in the north and therefore incorrectly assume that must be true for all of them, or you&#x27;re simply an untrustful and unreliable foreigner who might be lying to me. Real-life conversations don&#x27;t occur in a cultural vacuum, they&#x27;re exchanges between individuals with personal histories and relationships.<p>In other words, while abstract logic is culturally useful (i.e. it is a tool), real-life communication between individuals is not a game of abstract logic. Analysing language purely by its literal content (or &quot;text&quot;) ignores subtext, context and meta text, all of which are crucially important. Expecting someone to engage with you on a purely logical plane and to ignore all of that, when they&#x27;re not accustomed to doing so, seems extraordinarily silly. Given that the bears annecdote according to a sibling comment is nearly a hundred years old, I doubt the outside &quot;researcher&quot; took any of this into consideration.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40480274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40480274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">3abiton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479185">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40480379">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40480436">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40480274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40480274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s why IQ is a metric that can be improved.

With a little ingenious reasoning one may see in the material world simply a mirror, an image of permanent mental sensations. In either sphere self-knowledge is the condition and the limit of our consciousness. That is why, perhaps, many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of experience. They look within themselves—and find nothing! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside themselves, either.<p>&gt;However that may be, I came later to look for an image of my emotions and sensations in others. I had to learn the outward signs of inward feelings. The start of fear, the suppressed, controlled tensity of pain, the beat of happy muscles in others, had to be perceived and compared with my own experiences before I could trace them back to the intangible soul of another. Groping, uncertain, I at last found my identity, and after seeing my thoughts and feelings repeated in others, I gradually constructed my world of men and of God.

In &quot;normal life&quot; Consciousness is bound to the above three aspects of &quot;mind&quot; and hence &quot;suffers bondage&quot;. Patanjali Raja Yoga follows on Samkhya by giving a eight-part framework&#x2F;discipline (aka Ashtanga Yoga) to literally &quot;stop all mental&#x2F;thought stuff&quot;. Then Consciousness is no longer bound to externalities (including its own &quot;mind&quot;) but becomes settled within itself which is called Liberation (aka Moksha).<p>The Samkhya is Atheistic and Dualistic Realism and quite compatible with Modern Science where the former gives a &quot;inside out&quot; experiential and subjective model while the latter details a &quot;outside in&quot; material model.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40480081" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40480081" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jaggederest</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479388">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40480047">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40480378">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479354">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40480081">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40480081">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The eye is the lens that sees itself.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40479354" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40479354" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jukea</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479388">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40479354">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40479354">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I could never wrap my head around the fact that someone who couldn’t see or hear developed a mind able to think and write with such depth and clarity.</div><br/><div id="40479611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40479611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sh-run</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479354">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479702">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40479611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40479611">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right?

How come my brain holds a million different facts, records of! historical interactions with others, and a pretty decent track of time (like, I know the time, day, month and year and what I did-or-didn&#x27;t do yesterday), but my dreams are total gibberish? Like I was in a hotel lobby last night with a bunch of people I don&#x27;t know, realised I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t wearing any pants, then paniced because my phone was in my pants, how would I call my wife?

In other words, is language giving people a better sense of direction? Or is it that people who use their sense of direction a lot develop specialised language for that? This sort of concept is called linguistic relativism, and there&#x27;s some evidence for it, but it&#x27;s difficult to quantify or generalise too much.<p>What there is no evidence for is linguistic determinism, the idea that your language determined how you think and what you are able to think of. For example, your case of the empty bush: yes the people in question may not specifically use the word zero, but they understand what an empty bush is. In research, experiments with people who have no words for numbers showed that they could understand precise numerical quantities, albeit only to a limited extent because they hadn&#x27;t learned the skill of maths.

What would your abstraction of the experiences be?  How would you condense that into an understanding that could fit back into a single person&#x27;s experience?<p>To some extent, this is already the experience of the internet, and of language and culture in general.  We already operate at levels of empathy and understanding of possibilities at scales people even 50 years ago didn&#x27;t come close to.  We build many abstraction tools to try and distill these experiences down to wikipedias, reviews, analyses, podcasts.  We distill even those too - with a constant meta-cultural debate on what&#x27;s important, what&#x27;s cool, what&#x27;s political, what fits our personal identities, and what our interests and purposes are within the space of potential understanding.<p>We live in the space of the abstract.  We build virtual worlds, games, movies, economies in the abstract.  We anticipate a future where the abstract becomes even more tangible, yet also more diverse and ephemeral.  We are a flowering seed on the stalk of human consciousness up to this point - just how every generation has been to the ones before it - changing each time.<p>While this can still all reduce to &quot;language&quot; - the tool used between each generation, and which Keller used to awaken to the living culture of her moment in time - it&#x27;s not just language anymore.  There are more mediums now.  A complex story can be told with merely tacit interactions, exploring a virtual physical space with no dialogue.  Practical abstractions of these spaces make operating systems.  Language and abstract consciousness are embedded into new environments both virtual and real, instilling new tones of consciousness in everyone who interacts with them - just look at your phone use behavior for proof.  We are learning how to shape our minds by shaping our spaces.  We are learning to control the entire breadth of our experienced reality at once, so we can control ourselves (and each other).<p>Our limited bandwidths enforce that experiencing these perpetually crafted realities, stories, recorded experiences, journeys - be done one at a time, lest we lose parts of the whole in the abstracted summary.  And so we practice witnessing a mix of short abstractions and deep dives, making the most of a variety of experiences, all while balancing a real life and profession.  We maintain that bridge between the grounded experience of the now and the abstraction of the digested analyzed fiction of everything else.  The limits of the human perception seem to prohibit us from anything else.<p>But are those limits permanent?  Are we forever to experience time in such limited balanced uniform slices?  Will we never manage to connect our brains to these machines which experience time so much faster, and less linearly?  What would we be if we could experience all these worlds, not through merely abstracted stories and reviews, but through a direct walk - as if we were the eyes of every other person out there, in every second of experience?<p>Before we get to answer those questions for ourselves - and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re forever insurmountable technological challenges - it seems likely a new species of intelligence, raised from the start to think exactly like that, is being spawned in AIs.  We will see how it communicates the experience back to our lower dimensional slices of experience.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40479425" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40479425" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Salgat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479028">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479108">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479154">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40479425">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40479425">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve always seen this as simply convincing hallucinations rather than reality (the brain is able to believe some rather outlandish things after all).

I think there are many ways we can elevate our consciousness.<p>A profound change for me is seeing all communication and behavior of others as primarily a gradual revelation of other’s perspectives, and the logics (how they understand things) behind those perspectives - putting any judgements on their behaviors, or any ability to persuade, in a very back seat.<p>The actionable mirror of this perceptive stance is to avoid and distrust the efficacy of bridging differences with persuasion.<p>And also, to accumulate (instead of dismissing) all the alternative perspectives I can. Unanticipated combinations of others perspectives have changed my mind, long after acquiring them.<p>Instead of persuasion, take the half step of explaining the logic behind your perspectives, and understanding theirs. Without expecting adoption, or “belief” changes for either side.<p><i>Trusting others to change their own minds, in time or not at all, and visibly leaving the door open for one’s own evolution, is a very respectful stance.</i><p>In my experience, people feel a slow attraction to accepting and believing what they understand, in the absence of any coercive context.<p>But even when they don’t, they are more tolerant and less fearful of alternate perspectives when they can see the logic behind them. And feel like their own perspective’s logic is acknowledged.<p>Often common values behind seemingly antithetical perspectives are revealed that way. And greater willingness to collaborate toward values while appreciating continued bifurcated perspectives.<p>We all tend to judge behavior we don’t understand very harshly. Morally and intellectually. We judge the people who behave inexplicably harshly.<p>But persuasion tries too much. Two steps instead of one. It often creates tension and triggers rejections that explanations without proscription do not.<p>I don’t know how well this comes across, but it’s helped me as a teacher (not one by career) and to deal with difficult and ideological people much more effectively.<p>It is the lens I now see all social movement, in the small and large.<p>It is a dramatic change. I have made friends whose values I have completely challenged, and continue to do, who appreciate I understand their perspectives too.<p>And that our back and forth is an enjoyable and enlightening collaborative conversation, for both of us, not a fight. Each moment I understand them better, is a win for both of us. And for constructive engagement.<p>Probably not communicating this well. But if not parsing reality - and how all our brains actually choose what to believe, what choices to make - isn’t a higher level of consciousness, I don’t know what is.<p>Seperate perspective logic from beliefs, and process people’s values and actions with less judgement and more nuanced clarity of how they (we all) really operate.<p>TLDR; You don’t have to change your mind, or change other people’s minds to help them understand a different perspective, and to understand other’s perspectives. This is a lower bar, but stronger foundation for seeing and working with others than persuasion, an act that involves pitting ideas against ideas prematurely.<p>Permeating one’s view of the world as an ecosystem of perceptions, and the logics behind each of them, not beliefs, opens up profoundly better insights and results.<p>No [perspective] is right. [Many] are useful.<p>Understanding any perspective that anyone has is useful for updating one’s own model of the actual world, and one’s model of the human world.<p>It makes you multilingual, and a more effective and welcome “warrior priest” for peace and progress, in our untamed world of cultures, tribes, ideologies, and beliefs.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40479589" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40479589" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vjerancrnjak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479028">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40478710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40479589">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40479589">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s quite interesting how these descriptions align with Buddhist or Zen teachings.<p>I wonder if she was influenced by it or if this is a rediscovery.<p>The fact that she associates a sensation of contraction in the forehead as thinking is very interesting.<p>Also the fact of there being no time or no will.<p>Although she goes further to conclude that she acquired will, instead of illusion of will or choice due to previously experiencing no will or choice.</div><br/><div id="40480075" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40480075" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krackers</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479589">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479689">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40480075">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40480075">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How does Keller&#x27;s state pre-language differ from &quot;ego death&quot; and what UG Krishmaurti described as the &quot;natural state&quot; (where there is no continuous thought as part of the control loop)?

Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten — a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me.

Empathy in children is often more direct and unfiltered but this is also not unique to children. The pain and hurt and fear happened to you, it just wasn&#x27;t yours directly. You didn&#x27;t physically fall down those stairs but you experienced the event itself.

The sort of thoughts and sensations without consciousness she describes experiencing before language gave her consciousness - maybe this is the spark that LLMs do not have and humans do. It would be astounding if it turned out LLMs do have consciousness (as in, awareness of themselves) as it&#x27;s a byproduct of language, but they don&#x27;t have those embodied thoughts and feelings that Helen describes having before she had language. An entity like that has never existed before. We have conscious humans with language, and humans like Helen Keller pre-language who felt impulses, sensations, aping but not consciousness, but I don&#x27;t think there has ever been a human with consciousness but without any impulse.<p>I wonder what we could do to marry that language ability to think about the self and others and abstract concepts and the big social web, with the sort of embodied spark &amp; impulses that Helen describes. Would it be as simple as building a model physically embodied in a robot? Training a model on robotic sensory data from a body that it inhabits, then overwriting that training with language?

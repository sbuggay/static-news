Further income could be made with a lower surcharge for cargo and charters (let&#x27;s say 50 dollars), and a very small one (let&#x27;s say 10 dollars) for GA - assuming the above roughly 1&#x2F;3rd split, you&#x27;d have an additional 800 million dollars from charters and cargo, and 160 million from GA, leading to a total of about 2.6 billion dollars.<p>Increase the fees to 200 dollars for commercial flights and you&#x27;d get 4.2 billion dollars - an about 20% increase of the FAA&#x27;s current 19.8 billion dollars. That&#x27;s a lot of money that even the most price-sensitive, high frequency fliers will not really feel. Assuming some rich executive flying twice a day for 250 working days a year, he&#x27;d pay 1000$ more in travel costs, a tiiiiny fraction of his expenses. A hobbyist pilot with his PPL needs a minimum of 24 hours and a checkride every two years, so ~12 flights per year, so their FAA surcharge cost would be around ~120 dollars a year - not very much compared to the cost of getting and maintaining a PPL.<p>In the end, the whining is pointless (especially as I&#x27;ve shown the actual impact is negligible). Either the government subsidizes air traffic of all kinds (similar as it does for road and to a lesser extent rail traffic) and distributes the cost across all members of society, or it makes for a self-sufficient system, or a mix of both - but the status quo of keeping it on life support is no longer sustainable.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer a self-funding mechanism, alone because governments (not just in the US, it&#x27;s just most pronounced there) seem to be completely incapable of actually governing, and preferring to cut costs even where it&#x27;s actually life-critical.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;air_traffic&#x2F;by_the_numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;air_traffic&#x2F;by_the_numbers</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sos.noaa.gov&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;air-traffic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sos.noaa.gov&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;air-traffic&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transportation.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dot.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;2023-03&#x2F;FAA_FY_2024_President_Budget_508.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transportation.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dot.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;2023-03&#x2F;F...</a></div><br/><div id="40105856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40105856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sokoloff</span><span>|</span><a href="#40103906">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40104990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40105433">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40105856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40105856">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A hobbyist pilot with his PPL needs a minimum of 24 hours and a checkride every two years<p>Citation needed on the first part.

Go ahead and try, it will take you a while.<p>Every day, more than 2.5 million Americans fly in or out of US airports, along with, of course, many billions of dollars of cargo. At any one time, there are about 5,000 aircraft above the United States.<p>On 9&#x2F;11, for example, air traffic controllers guided every one of them to a safe landing in a little over an hour. Go ahead and try that.<p>It’s the kind of job where even a small mistake could lead instantly to the deaths of hundreds of people. Not surprisingly, the hiring standards for air traffic controllers were long among the most selective of all federal jobs.<p>Applicants typically needed to complete military service or pass the FAA’s Collegiate Training Initiative Program. After that, they sat for a specially-designed exam that tested for relevant job skills, skills like math ability and complex problem-solving.<p>Only those with the highest scores made the cut. The system was designed to choose the best. And for decades, it worked.<p>Then, during the Obama administration, activist bureaucrats decided that the pool of air traffic controllers wasn’t diverse enough. They never explained why diversity ought to matter in air traffic control or why it was more important than traditional goals like competence and public safety.<p>The FAA, without a vote, just scrapped the old hiring system and replaced it with a diversity-friendly version. Most people have no idea this happened.<p>The FAA now requires many of its applicants to fill out what they call a biographical questionnaire before any other screening. Those who answer the questions in a way that diversity monitors don’t like cannot be considered for hiring, not matter how much experience they have or how well they may do on the other portions of the testing.<p>The biographical questionnaire is all important. So, what is in this biographical questionnaire? Well, we can answer that question because we’ve got a copy of it and we also got information about how it is scored. And it’s shocking!<p>For example, one question asked test-takers to name their worst grade in high school. The preferred answer for that is science. In other words, if you can’t do science, the FAA is especially eager to hire you as an air traffic controller. You get 10 points for being bad at science, according to the scoring sheet.<p>Another question asked about work history. According to the FAA, the best answer to that question is you haven’t worked at all in the past three years. You get 10 points for not working.<p>Apparently, unemployed people make the best air traffic controllers. This is demented, by the way, but it’s real. So do applicants who played a lot of sports in high school. They’re rewarded too.<p>By contrast, applicants who say they know a great deal about air traffic control get only five points. Trained pilots get two points.<p>Once again, applicants who haven’t worked at all, who have been unemployed for the past three years, get 10 points. Pilots, 2 points. This is insane. And it’s dangerous. It’s also indefensible.<p>We asked the FAA’s top spokesman why applicants for an air traffic control job would get more points for playing high school sports than for flying planes or knowing a lot about air traffic control.<p>His response, “I’m trying to find that out as well.” Well, not actually trying very hard, it turns out. We still haven’t heard back with a real explanation and, of course, we won’t because there isn’t one, other than shut up, diversity.<p>But we won’t shut up. This is too important.

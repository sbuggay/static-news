Most people, when they first reach for a non-tree graph, choose to weaken the definition of the edge even beyond what is implied by tree edges, which usually means &quot;owns&quot; or &quot;contains&quot; or the like. By default, an edge in a non-tree graph simply means &quot;relates to, somehow&quot;. And a beginning user faced with a bunch of nodes are just going to draw a bunch of lines between topics that seem to tangentially relate to other nodes, until they get the big hairball.<p>If, however, you get stricter about the definition of the edge in a graph, they&#x27;re superior to trees in many contexts. An edge might mean &quot;predates&quot;, or another edge might mean &quot;implies&quot;. Those are the two main definitions I use, because when needing a graph I&#x27;m usually either thinking of planning (prerequisites, when some things need to be done &quot;before&quot; another), or I&#x27;m thinking of arguing&#x2F;concluding (where some things when combined &quot;imply&quot; a conclusion). It doesn&#x27;t really work to conflate the two.<p>You can also combine multiple edge definitions into one graph, and maybe it&#x27;d look like a hairball if you&#x27;re displaying all of them at once, but if you filter it gets more useful.<p>Two more things... graphs almost always, in my experience, are more visually useful when they are directed, whether acyclic or not. Radial just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much added benefit. And, a pet peeve is mine is when people use radial UX to display a tree and then call it a &quot;graph&quot;. I know, it&#x27;s a picture of bubbles and arrows, so it&#x27;s a &quot;graph&quot; in that sense, but most bubble graph software doesn&#x27;t even support graph data structures. If you grab one bubble and apply gravity, it just shakes out into a tree.</div><br/><div id="38836501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38836501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Lichtso</span><span>|</span><a href="#38836346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38837057">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38836501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38836501">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh yes, edges of different types and their direction are definitely what the author of the post was missing.<p>This is precisely where triple (hyper) graphs and the idea of semantic networks comes in.

My thoughts.<p>Hierarchical views arenât easy because they are common, they are easy because it matches how humans think on a basic level. We take a concept, draw a line down the middle, and get two refined concepts. That cleaving is a natural process that produces hierarchical trees. If you can display your data in a tree, you have the optimal view most of the time.<p>The trick isnât finding a better graph. The trick is making your data look like a tree.<p>Donât confuse your schema and your view. Your schema will almost always be a cyclic graph. But if you define an arbitrary root node and choose a subset of relationships, you can easily create a hierarchy view of a subset of the graph.<p>All generic nontree views suck beyond a certain complexity. Unless you have a specific kind of cyclic data and specific rendering, it will look bad. The issue is that there is one type of shape for acyclic hierarchical data, the tree, but infinite for cyclic data. If you are displaying cyclic data well, the graph has been tuned for the use case. Drawing cyclic graphs is an NP hard problem, and you need to choose heuristics to layout the nodes.<p>The best graphs views are a lot more than lines and boxes. They facilitate specific jobs, and surface key information and actions. When nodes have heterogeneous types they may need their own renderings beyond simple styling. Just drawing words with connecting lines provides shocking little value, especially for those who arenât spatial thinkers.<p>To add to that, some people really like graphs and some donât. No graph will be good enough to get a graph hater to like it. So any time you display a graph you need an alternate view, like a list. And that brings us back to hierarchical trees.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38839222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zubairq</span><span>|</span><a href="#38839309">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Always tough to traverse content when it is a graph, I see this a lot in low code tools which give an impossible to traverse graph</div><br/></div></div><div id="38838020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LASR</span><span>|</span><a href="#38839222">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38836393">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838020">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the context of LLMs, graphs or their simpler cousins - trees are surprisingly good as both inputs and outputs.<p>My team builds LLM-based features as part of our b2b SaaS product.<p>The primary challenge is how to get fuzzy, incomplete, heterogeneous business knowledge into LLMs and do something useful with it.

Everything else is typically less helpful than it could be. I don&#x27;t find network graphs like those usually produced by &quot;second brain&quot; tools that useful at all. Even  Niklas Luhmann, who largely inspired this networked hypertext approach with his analog zettelkasten imposed enough structure through meta notes and special linkages such that browsing at a particular node could be more hierarchical latticeesque and directed. Browsing pure undirected networks is usually not super useful when it comes to fashioning structured understanding precisely because such an object almost completely lacks structure. Perhaps a set (sans any linkages) is perhaps the only other object with less structure than the undirected network.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38835847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38835847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thih9</span><span>|</span><a href="#38836305">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38835974">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38835847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38835847">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess weâre used to dealing with non-hierarchical data in real life.

We think about this a lot as we work on problems like how to make it easy to explore 100,000X+ more relationships on screen than they&#x27;re showing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphistry&#x2F;pygraphistry">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphistry&#x2F;pygraphistry</a> .<p>First, what do graph visualizations do?<p>- They let us see the relationships in data. The article discusses hierarchy. But there is also progression, root cause, scope, and basically any correlation&#x2F;causation relationship ML&#x2F;AI figures out. There are many interesting relationship questions that pop out as soon as you logs, tables, events, etc!<p>- They let us directly manipulate the nodes &amp; edges, such as for drilling down, navigating, reclustering, etc.<p>- A useful &#x27;aha&#x27; is thinking of modern information visualization as trying to optimize some sort of time-to-insight through a sequence of visual interactions. So each view must be information dense for visually revealing certain insights, and make it easy to get to the next set of visual Q&amp;A.<p>- Ex: When the entities are the interesting thing wrt questions, being able to drill down into individual nodes&#x2F;edges into great dedicated views becomes important, so graphs should often be multimodal. And if the relationship aspect is unimportant... then using graph view hurts more than it helps.<p>- From optimization perspective, it now makes sense to specialize for specific domains. Maybe what is needed is more of a small diagram, and not actually investigating a lot of relationships. Or a graph of subway stops, which has additional visual considerations. For a website, a sitemap navigation vs clickstream product analytics view would likewise need<p>A good analogy is a map. Sometimes exploring Google Maps is great, and you drill into a business inspector sidebar or down to a street view. But other times, it&#x27;s better to have the map embedded into Yelp.com restaurant entry when you just need a quick view of mapping information as part of some broader context. Or you don&#x27;t care about that map at all and can skip it.<p>Given all that.. it&#x27;s interesting to revisit asking... what is the &#x27;content&#x27; job to be solved? What kinds of content lean towards graph, and which don&#x27;t?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I have been living the “mess” of internet email for over 20 years.<p>Here’s the thing: despite the internet’s email system being complex and confusing and riddled with problems, it is universally adopted and interoperable. No other open communication tool can boast of email’s massive interoperability.<p>Any new system will face the impossible burden of winning hearts and minds while the old system continues to chug along with billions of annual R&amp;D spending and dozens of conferences full of smart people working on solving problems.<p>Even if “MX2” can peacefully coexist in the DNS, why would anyone spend the millions of dollars in engineering effort to move while their teams are busy building the latest layer that’s been invented to patch over the current system?<p>By all means if you want to propose a new email system, show up at IETF or M3AAWG and make a bold proposal. Someone will buy you a beer while they explain why you are much better off getting into the mud pit with the rest of us and working on the next pragmatic fix to keep things rolling along.</div><br/><div id="40394569" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40394569" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kilburn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40394319">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40395104">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40394569">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40394569">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, they would school them on actual-world problems in the process:<p>- You can&#x27;t wait until you receive the entire body to be able to compute a signature to then validate the sender as your first line of defense. It is just too expensive and opens you to DDOS attacks. People use IP reputation as a first line of defense because it is cheap, not because it is good.<p>- You cannot enforce people&#x27;s behavior through RFCs. I can assure you that random guy next desk will not care about your &quot;this is a top-posting-thread&quot; header and bottom post there. Even if she has to manually copy&#x2F;paste things around.<p>- Likewise, auto-generated plain-text versions of HTML (or other rich-text formats) are no better than what screen readers can achieve. Most poeple won&#x27;t bother writing that alternate version, meaning the obligatory alt text is now less useful than when it was optional and only people who cared inculded it.<p>- Your largest client may not update their e-mail infrastructure to comply with the latest standards. If that happens, you don&#x27;t tell them to update or otherwise you won&#x27;t be answering them because their e-mails go to spam. You do whatever is necessary to ensure that their e-mails <i>don&#x27;t</i> go to spam.

(And of course, if the content exceeds the declaration, termination and immediate IP temporary ban, safe to do as this is an obvious violation of a new spec?)<p>2. The goal is to make it easier for the email client which by itself will encourage good behavior. There’s also no requirement for the messages to all be in one massive blob.<p>3. The goal is that it would be automatically created by the client. For personal emails, this is easy. For enhanced HTML emails, that is where the requirement comes in. Email providers can come up with their own ways of enforcement from there (I.e. “if it’s only one sentence, you obviously didn’t do it”), though I get your point and that would become messy unofficial spec again.<p>4. Could a future emails system have versioning, allowing the server to clearly communicate (“Hello, I implement MX2 v3.1.”)?

(This already occurs on recipient receive for some SMTP servers [just before BDATA&#x2F;DATA] via the email address).<p>What would one bad email to an email guid do? Would it force rotation of the guid[s] throughout the entire forest? If so, how would that be communicated externally? How would you communicate it for just the one address, if you just changed the one guid?<p>Would you, instead, have to keep a guid history to check against -- or lose all of the email between possible compromise and the sender&#x27;s database update? Would you just keep it in the Transport Queue, until manual intervention could check out email between the possible compromise of the guid and new mail would be received for the new guid? That wouldn&#x27;t scale for large enterprises.<p>Keep in mind that nothing has to be sent for recipient validation to occur. The SMTP Server[s] just respond[s] to the recipient block with the next step -- but the caller doesn&#x27;t have to complete the SMTP negotiation from this point, they already have validation if the addresses (even these proposed guids) are valid.<p>Tarpitting is somewhat of a viable option, here, but it isn&#x27;t foolproof.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Directory_Harvest_Attack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Directory_Harvest_Attack</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40394519" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40394519" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deskr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40394319">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40395104">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40394364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40394519">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40394519">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; universally adopted and interoperable<p>No. Big email server all over the place might drop your emails for whatever reason is and they won&#x27;t tell you.</div><br/><div id="40395643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40395643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ttul</span><span>|</span><a href="#40394319">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40394519">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40395383">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40395643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40395643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Protocols aren’t going to change that.

Not from some intermediary recipient, e.g., an &quot;email provider&quot;.  What if the the recipient had to identify acceptable senders before they could &quot;send&quot; mail to the recipient.  Arguably this already happens every time an email recpient gives out their email address to some email sender.  What if the sender did not &quot;send&quot; mail but instead uploaded it to host run by the sender and accessible by the recipient.  Then the recipient retrieves the mail from the sender.<p>In the past, one large email provider had an RSS feed for a user&#x27;s inbox.  What if the RSS feed is not provided by some third party &quot;email provider&quot; but by _senders_.  What if the feed indicates whether there is new mail waiting to be retrieved by the recipient.  Arguably, something like this already happens, albeit using third party intermediaries, for example as millions of people use non-public webpages on third party websites to communicate with each other, instead of using email.  Recipients check these pages for comments or messages from &quot;senders&quot;.<p>A simpler idea that requires no changes to any email protocol, which I have tested successfully on home network, is for sender and recipient to be on a peer-to-peer overlay and run their own SMTP servers, like the original internet.  The sender SMTP server communicates directly with the receiver&#x27;s SMTP server, not a third party SMTP server run by an &quot;email provider&quot;.  Obviously, sender and receiver should not invite anyone onto this network who they do not know and from which they do not want to receive email.<p>The fundamental problem with email is that personal, non-commercial email is mixed with commercial email, mail that is selling something.  That&#x27;s beneficial to marketers, but not email users.  Any change to email that threatens to exclude the unsolicited, commercial email will be opposed fervently.</div><br/><div id="40396891" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40396891" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zimpenfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#40394319">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40395383">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40397421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40396891">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40396891">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What if email were &quot;pickup only&quot; _from the sender_.<p>Congrats, you&#x27;ve invented DJB&#x27;s Internet Mail 2000[1].

Reject at the SMTP level for invalid sender identification.
Gradually tighten up on invalid sender identification. In general, reject and pass back errors to the sender rather than sending to a &quot;junk&quot; folder. This is useful for making the big services clean up their act. If Google&#x27;s gmail sender gets a hard reject at the SMTP level for a lot of mails from a sender, they will probably do something to the sender.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trog.qgl.org&#x2F;20081217&#x2F;the-why-your-anti-spam-idea-wont-work-checklist&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trog.qgl.org&#x2F;20081217&#x2F;the-why-your-anti-spam-idea-wo...</a></div><br/><div id="40396595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40396595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">newscracker</span><span>|</span><a href="#40393890">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40393101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40396595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40396595">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Same for spam filtering.

[1] It checks for a few different things and rejects the mail if the spam criteria are met. In my limited experience, many mail server admins of large organizations don’t even look at these email rejections to take any action. The result is that the mails keep getting rejected and the receiver doesn’t even know the context or content (by design).<p>* Posteo now has the option of accepting mail and putting it in the Spam folder too, if one desires this mode of operation.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posteo.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;help&#x2F;how-does-the-posteo-spam-filter-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posteo.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;help&#x2F;how-does-the-posteo-spam-filter-wo...</a></div><br/><div id="40396750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40396750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#40393890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40396595">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40396925">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40396750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40396750">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nice. That, plus the first item I mentioned, real-time forwarding, would mean that fails would show up immediately in your sending program, rather than a possible bounce message from a forwarder. Anything that can reject mail should work that way. The recipient&#x27;s final IMAP server, which may have spam filtering, should also pass back rejections as SMTP statuses. So, if you get the &quot;send completed&quot; from your sending SMTP client, that should mean it&#x27;s in the recipient&#x27;s mailbox waiting to be read. This would improve the user experience for person-to-person email.<p>This is completely backwards compatible, so it&#x27;s quite do-able as an enhancement. Most email forwarders today are old and from the store-and-forward era, and from systems where opening large numbers of TCP connections was a problem.<p>There&#x27;s a sub-status for rejected spam:<p><pre><code>    550 5.7.1 Delivery not authorized, message refused
</code></pre>
That subcode list hasn&#x27;t been changed since 2003. A few new codes would be useful. I&#x27;d suggest:<p><pre><code>    550 5.7.8 Message refused - spam
    550 5.7.9 Message refused - not compliant with laws in recipient&#x27;s region. (CAN-SPAM, etc.)
    550 5.7.10 Message refused - phishing attempt &#x2F; hostile code
    550 5.7.11 Message refused - previous messages from same sender also refused
</code></pre>
Let the spam filters talk back that way to the delivery services.
It would be useful if mail delivery services noted such statuses and gave the sender a spam strike.
They don&#x27;t have to pay attention to that info, but the better ones would.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40396925" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40396925" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zimpenfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#40393890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40396595">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40396750">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40393101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40396925">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40396925">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; many mail server admins of large organizations don’t even look at these email rejections to take any action<p>Because, sadly, it&#x27;s trivial to forge the return address and generate (many!) rejections to places that didn&#x27;t send the email in the first place.<p>(I&#x27;ve only got a tiny email server and I largely stopped caring about bounce messages a decade ago for this very reason.

I&#x27;d love to see mail be rebooted.<p>A few thoughts:<p>1. I don&#x27;t know if HTTPS is the best analogy, since it took 20 years for it to really become widely used (vs. non-secure HTTP). I think a better analogy might be the transition from HTTP&#x2F;1.1 to HTTP&#x2F;2 (or HTTP&#x2F;3?).<p>2. I don&#x27;t think we can rely on large providers (e.g. GMail) to quickly adopt a new system and even issue switchover ultimatums. A simpler mail system may not be in their best interest. Aiming for slower, organic growth could be more realistic. Even if a next-generation mail system never becomes dominant, it could still provide value. (Maybe Mastodon&#x2F;ActivityPub is the analogy here?)<p>3. In any sort of reboot, I think a modern encryption system (something like Signal protocol?) would be a must.<p>4. Can we have a system where senders need to hold tokens to authorize them to send a message to a recipient? The whole &quot;anyone on earth should be able to send you an unsolicited message&quot; idea is ultimately the source of the spam problem.

I don&#x27;t know if HTTPS is the best analogy...<p>IMO, the lynchpin to HTTPS accessibility was that we made cutting certificates easy, and most importantly, free. By eschewing the baseline requirement for cutting a certificate to being able to validate that the site on the domain is trusted by virtue of a relationship between the hostname and the certificate requester, and providing an API to automate the renewal process, opting into HTTPS went from &quot;administrative burden that needed a sysadmin to manage&quot; to &quot;service any hosting provider could leverage&quot;. LetsEncrypt and the ACME protocol, and Cloudflare before them, did much to radically change the landscape for making HTTPS accessible to everyone. [1] That makes the analogy pretty apt to me, IMO.<p>2. You make a very valid point here. By virtue of letting SMTP languish so long, bandaiding it as we went, instead of opting for a major refactor of how email works, we made an environment that was rife for consolidation. As a result, it makes sense that we might have to boil the frog to make a change.<p>3. I&#x27;d love to see it, but I&#x27;d be interested in learning how key exchange&#x2F;trust works. I&#x27;d be interested to see how you&#x27;d envision enabling new senders to send you mail.<p>4. This feeds back into my comments on 3. With established contacts, this is great, but in a world where, say, you were giving a talk, and wanted to offer folks that listened to your talk a way to contact you afterwards, how would you distribute the token? If someone abuses the permissions, how do you invalidate it? I can&#x27;t foresee this being an all-or-nothing system, and don&#x27;t really see a system where creating some sort of one-way or two-way trust between individual senders and recipients is at all feasible.<p>[1] Let&#x27;s Encrypt stats: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;stats&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;stats&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40394572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40394572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rakoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40393470">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40395414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40394572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40394572">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">2nd-gen email exists in the form of xmpp. Reuse HTML constructs if you dare (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xmpp.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;xep-0071.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xmpp.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;xep-0071.html</a>) or use simpler, safer markup (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xmpp.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;xep-0393.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xmpp.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;xep-0393.html</a>).

You can put mails in your own outbox via IMAP, where the mail server can pick them up and send them. Why don&#x27;t browsers load HTML via FTP? ActivityPub is basically SMTP if it was JSON (it&#x27;s so much SMTP that it has a field for &#x27;envelope sender&#x27; which was previously thought to be a specific quirk of SMTP), so why don&#x27;t we use it for email? Or why don&#x27;t we use SMTP for chatting? Actually, wait, Delta Chat literally does that. Or why don&#x27;t we use XMPP for email? Or, I don&#x27;t know, Apache Kafka or Redis. A Kafka server allows you to publish arbitrary messages and stores them until they&#x27;re retrieved, which is also what a mail server or a chat server does. The only real difference is how authorization works. If you run IRC over Kafka, or IRC over NNTP, you won&#x27;t lose messages when you disconnect - sounds pretty sensible.

Probably nothing, but it adds a lot more complication. You may think it&#x27;s well-understood if you only know the happy path (requests.get(&quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blah&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blah&#x2F;</a>&quot;) and magically get a response). Do you know about HTTP Request Smuggling, for example? Nobody knew about that for 20+ years. HTTP brings a lot of dark corners which are not well-understood.<p>The workflow with hypothetical Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (wait, that name is already taken... damn it): 1. Connect to recipient&#x27;s server; 2. Send the mail as a sequence of bytes; 3. Receive response code; 4. Disconnect.<p>And the workflow with hypothetical HTTP Mail Transfer Protocol: 1. Connect to recipient&#x27;s server. 2. Send the magic text string &quot;POST &#x2F;inbox 1.1\r\nHost: yourserver.com\r\nContent-Type: message&#x2F;rfc822\r\n\r\n&quot;. 3. Send the mail as a sequence of bytes. 4. Receive the magic string &quot;HTTP&#x2F;1.1 &quot;. 5. Receive response code. 6. Receive some more bytes you don&#x27;t care about. 7. Disconnect.<p>I&#x27;m just not clear on what benefit is added by steps 2, 4 and 6. It&#x27;s not the host header, since emails include their full destination address. It&#x27;s not the content-type, since you already knew it was an email message.<p>---<p>The same, but to a lesser extent, with JSON. I don&#x27;t think JSON has many vulnerabilities in dark corners, but it does have inconsistent implementations. Trailing commas? Comments?<p>If you&#x27;re using JSON to just send the email then it&#x27;s the same question as HTTP: what is added by the extra steps? If you&#x27;re also converting the email itself to a JSON-based format (as opposed to MIME which is currently used) that might not be worse or better (MIME is pretty annoying) but it&#x27;s also incompatible for no real reason. It will be a separate protocol, not an &quot;upgrade&quot; to email - may as well use Matrix instead.<p>It brings its own problems, some of which MIME also has. Because you can write things in any order in JSON, you could send the whole 800-megabyte attachment before you tell the server who the email is going to, and the server might have to buffer that in RAM or in a temporary file. In MIME, the headers always come before the body. JSON can have deep nesting, and a naive parsing of 9999999 open brackets followed by 9999999 close brackets will lead to a stack overflow. If you reject those brackets, now you&#x27;re rejecting valid emails just because you happen to not like them. This problem also exists in MIME, but at least MIME nesting more than a few levels is extremely rare since only entire messages and files get nested (e.g. attachments, and plaintext versions of HTML emails), not metadata, while JSON also has nesting for metadata. Additionally, servers don&#x27;t actually have to process MIME nesting in many cases, but can treat the whole message as one big byte stream. It&#x27;s mainly only clients who have to parse them. Servers would have to parse the whole JSON message in case there&#x27;s important metadata after it.<p>Also since the order can be anything, servers couldn&#x27;t look at the recipient first, open a file in their mailbox, then write the mail to the file as it arrives, since they might not know who the recipient is until after the whole message has arrived.<p>Finally, JSON handles binary attachments even worse than MIME does.<p>---<p>You mention &quot;get a domain, run a web-app, set a few records and you are done&quot;. Why do you believe that is something exclusive to HTTP? Get a domain, run a mail-app, set a few records and you are done, too.<p>The difficulty with setting up your own mail is with outgoing mail. Incoming mail is generally unrestricted. But when you want to <i>send</i> mail, the recipient&#x27;s mail server has to be convinced it isn&#x27;t spam, and that&#x27;s really hard no matter what the protocol is. Whatever you can do, spammers can do it too. The Fediverse works a bit like you describe, with JSON-based mails going over HTTP, and just hasn&#x27;t gotten flooded with spam yet because it hasn&#x27;t. Also spam is a little bit out of fashion thanks to the good filters at places like Gmail. It used to be that literally 99% of email&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s inbox would be spam - only 1 out of every 100 a real email - but that&#x27;s no longer the case. I imagine that setting up a new spam ring isn&#x27;t really worth it, but some spammers who set them up long ago just keep operating them since it costs little. It will happen to the Fediverse too; it has almost no spam defences.<p>A lot of hosting providers block you from sending emails (connecting to other people&#x27;s port 25). That&#x27;s because hacked servers that send spam are much more common than servers that want to send legitimate mail. <i>Most</i> of them will unblock it if you ask nicely. This mechanism doesn&#x27;t exist for HTTP, but I&#x27;m not sure if this mechanism is required to stop spam these days anyway.<p>---<p>Onion routers means Tor. It has its own address space. The point is, it&#x27;s a network that&#x27;s not the internet. It&#x27;s an overlay network, so you need an internet connection and specific software to use it. If there&#x27;s ever a serious .onion mail infrastructure, you might get mail at your internet address from a .onion address via some kind of gateway server. I&#x27;m on foo.onion, my server (being set up as a special .onion mail server) knows internet mail can go to bar.onion, which is also bar.com on the internet, and it will be passed on to the right internet server at yourdomain.com. The fact that this is even allowed <i>at all</i> is something I find elegant about email (and Usenet) and it would be a shame to get rid of it for... basically no reason. It would still be possible to do this if it was all HTTP-based; foo.onion would connect to bar.onion using HTTP instead of SMTP and that wouldn&#x27;t really make any difference. Scenarios like this one only become problematic if the new design requires two-way communication between the sender and the receiver, like a key exchange. They don&#x27;t become problematic just because you added steps 2, 4 and 6 to the protocol.<p>A related scenario is networks with limited connectivity. There are proposals for wireless ad-hoc store-and-forward networks, with very high latency, where two nodes would exchange messages whenever they happen to be within range of each other - imagine people with cellphones walking around a city, and only a small percentage of people have the app. Whenever two people with the app sit in the same café, they automatically swap messages to get the messages closer to their destinations on average. The one-way latency could up to days, if the messages arrive at all. If they often don&#x27;t arrive, then the network is broken, non-viable, so let&#x27;s assume they usually arrive after some hours to days. Email can work on these networks because it&#x27;s one-way. You put a message into the network, and it somehow (according to the network design) spreads around until eventually the recipient has a copy and can read it. The recipient can&#x27;t send a message back to negotiate a secret key, because that would take more hours or days, and then more hours or days while the key negotiation result comes back, and so on.<p>Most protocols can&#x27;t work in this kind of network. Email (and Usenet) can. It would be a shame to ever delete this ability just because of... not much reason at all. Protocols in the Internet age are designed for systems to be able to &quot;directly&quot; communicate with each other with up to a few seconds of delay. I put &quot;directly&quot; in quotes because there are actually many IP routers in between them. Email actually pre-dates the Internet, so it doesn&#x27;t rely on the Internet existing. Actually, the environment which email (as well as other systems like Fidonet and Usenet) were designed for wasn&#x27;t too different from the wireless mesh scenario, although with a more predictable schedule. (Actually, I think Usenet was designed for more expensive permanent connections, but it still has the same design)<p>Of course, corporations won&#x27;t be sending you invoices over any weird networks. Nor do any major mail servers know how to find a gateway for an overlay network. In fact 99.99% of the internet won&#x27;t be able to send you mail in these weird situations. So feel free to delete it from the protocol if you like.. .nobody will notice. I think it&#x27;s a pretty cool ability though. When Earth and Mars establish communication and there&#x27;s a 2-to-6-hour light-speed delay, people will definitely notice if the email protocol takes extra round-trips.<p>---<p>Several months ago I signed up for a Usenet account just to see how it works. The most interesting thing I noticed, other than the one-way store-and-forward synchronize-once-a-day-if-you-want design, is that it has all the exact same problems as modern systems, and the exact same solutions, and even the exact same caveats to those solutions, 30 to 40 years earlier than our modern systems. We have been reinventing the wheel all this time and haven&#x27;t gotten anywhere. Well, I lied - the problems and solutions are a little bit different, but really not all that different.<p>I also noticed that ActivityPub is basically just email if you change SMTP to HTTP and change MIME to JSON. It might be exactly the protocol you&#x27;re looking for, and the fact it&#x27;s associated with federated Twitter clones is accidental - just like the fact SMTP is associated with email, since SMTP can send any blocks of text data, and ActivityPub can send any blocks of JSON data. You might be interested in experimenting with it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40395077" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40395077" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amanda99</span><span>|</span><a href="#40394870">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40394887">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40394903">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40393068">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40395077">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40395077">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure if this is sarcasm or not.</div><br/><div id="40395131" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40395131" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sangupta</span><span>|</span><a href="#40394870">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40395077">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40393068">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40395131">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40395131">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nopes.

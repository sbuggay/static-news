The hardware isn&#x27;t as svelte as Apple&#x27;s, but mine has traveled all over the world and has yet to have any major issues. The one hardware failure I had was that the USB-C half of the charging cable on my 13&quot; eventually broke after a few years of abuse, but that used to happen to me with Apple charging cables, too.<p>Framework has an active initiative to do outreach to different Linux distro communities and give them free hardware to help shore up compatibility.

It&#x27;s equipped with 32GB ram and a 1TB drive.<p>It has good intentions but falls short. I would say overall it is a mediocre laptop in terms of quality.<p>Will it last longer than any other laptop? I would think so, it has a strong story of available parts and upgrades. Similarly I believe it would last longer than any other laptop, since you can essentially do a Ship of Theseus with it.<p>Pain points:<p><pre><code>  - display hinge problem, picking up the laptop would make the screen lie flat 180 degrees, which is really annoying - this has been fixed in newer versions of framework, but to get a new hinge kit costs $39 AUD plus $30 AUD in shipping, so I&#x27;m not willing to make that purchase due to the ridiculous shipping price.

  - the modular ports are nice, but I&#x27;d rather just have fixed ports and more of them, of course that&#x27;d obstruct the repair&#x2F;modularity story.

  - sometimes the modular ports do not work after resuming from a hibernate, I have to eject and reseat it.

  - the display is okay, I notice mine has a small granular line of off coloured pixels - i don&#x27;t think this is due to any physical damage but rather a defect in the screen as I&#x27;ve never had this kind of issue with any other laptop and I&#x27;ve handled the framework fairly carefully; but this line of off coloured pixels is very faint and virtually unnoticeable at bright colours, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal as I make it out to be.

  - the keyboard works great, but I was hoping for an upgrade to something along the lines of an apple style layout with half height inverted-t arrow keys and fn&#x2F;ctrl swapped; the idea of a marketplace for custom parts doesn&#x27;t seem to really exist.

  - Battery life of about 3-4 hours of very average usage.

  - Speakers are trash.

My takeaways:<p>- I would rather buy a MacBook now, the whole ecosystem is nicer. This is not Frameworkâs fault, Appleâs ecosystem just works and at some point you just want stuff that works. I absolutely love the AirPods and thereâs always some minor annoyances when pairing with the laptop.<p>- The removable port adapters are nice but not that useful in reality. I occasionally change the charging port to the other side to make charging easier in different spaces. The HDMI adapter sometimes needs to be removed and reinserted which sucks.<p>- The build quality is good enough. I wouldnât expect any less from any laptop at that price point.<p>- I believe the main selling point was that you could switch parts easily. However, I donât see myself performing any major upgrade like changing the mobo&#x2F;cpu. Those upgrades are fairly expensive. Also, I donât see myself building stuff with a spare mobo&#x2F;cpu.<p>- Given the previous point, I wouldnât say this laptop is going to last me longer than any other high quality laptop. I have a Sony VAIO that is still working after more than a decade. I expect the same of this laptop and I expect the same of any high end laptop.<p>- speakers suck.<p>Overall I think the concept is really nice and I am glad that I supported the company. However, I think that making conventional laptops more repairable is good enough. Full modularity is a cool concept but it does seem to have a lot of drawbacks. Give me the ability to easily change the hard drive, the RAM, the battery, the keyboard&#x2F;trackpad and that is sufficient for me. Maybe the screen.<p>If you are really environmentally conscious I would say you can achieve something similar by buying a high end device, using it 5-8 years, and then sell it&#x2F;gift it when you need to upgrade.<p>Thereâs also the argument that a perfectly good laptop can end in a trash bin because of a faulty port or something minor. But honestly, I have never had that happen. Either Iâm just lucky or electronics at this price point are generally well built. Given that you did a bit of research before buying.</div><br/><div id="42564648" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42564648" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vladvasiliu</span><span>|</span><a href="#42564517">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42564356">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42564648">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42564648">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Overall I think the concept is really nice and I am glad that I supported the company.

Maybe the screen.<p>I doubt that changing the mobo &#x2F; cpu is something done very frequently, so I could accept it to be a bit more involved (as in require multiple screws instead of just pulling it out or similar).<p>For that, something like an HP EliteBook would be good enough. The laptops are fairly OK if you don&#x27;t insist on good quality screens. They&#x27;re easily serviceable for the most common parts (the battery is held in place with screws, the ssd and ram are removable, the screen hinges are screwed in, but are metal and quite robust).<p>I don&#x27;t know how easy it is to find spare parts for these actual laptops, but my point is that this could maybe be a better compromise than the full-modular framework. Of course, HP has to change the models every year to look new, but a dedicated manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t have to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42564356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42564356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lytedev</span><span>|</span><a href="#42564517">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42564669">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42564356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42564356">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I ordered my AMD one late in 2023 and love it.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect as battery life compared to the Apple Silicon MacBooks is simply not a competition, but everywhere else it&#x27;s close enough for me.<p>Being able to upgrade the screen already was a huge &quot;yes, thank you&quot; as instead of needing to buy an entirely new machines for a particular upgrade I was able to quite simply swap in the new part, which is what I&#x27;m used to on the desktop hardware side of things.

Also the bios I have is now a year old, and there only has been one non-beta bios upgrade in the whole lifetime of this model (~2.5 years). So the software side of things is just miserable...

Also, there is such a thing as a bad product which is bad even for zero dollars because humans are the end of the day have a finite lifespan and at some point it isn&#x27;t worth wasting my time with an Intel 14th gen processor because I don&#x27;t want to gamble with the possibility of an RMA.

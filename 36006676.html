For all the talk of Agile processes and breaking creative work down into bite-sized chunks and prioritising collaboration and team productivity over individual contributions, ultimately our work is about <i>thinking</i> and fundamentally it requires that each individual doing the work understands what needs to be done. Not investing enough time in gaining that understanding early on means wasting far more time later.<p>IME, a huge amount of rework in modern software development results from diving into the implementation before the requirements were properly understood, a reasonable design was created and both were recorded in some useful form and reviewed by the relevant people to make sure everyone was on the same page.<p>We seem to have gone from one extreme to another with our processes. We realised that waterfalls that start with months of requirements capture followed by months of BDUF aren’t a great idea. But now we often seem to have one-paragraph tickets, maybe spend a few minutes thinking of some class names that look about right for each one, and then dive into coding. And then a week later we find that two developers working on three tickets have implemented the same concept four different ways and each of them was a different 75% of what the customer actually needed.</div><br/><div id="36009498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36009498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">turtledragonfly</span><span>|</span><a href="#36008222">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36009498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36009498">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; slow is smooth and smooth is fast<p>Another phrase with similar meaning (and interesting history) is &quot;festina lente&quot; (&quot;make haste slowly,&quot; in Latin).

At least not as intended.  Occasionally it happens, but only by pure chance.<p>It seems the &#x27;agile way&#x27; is to attempt to manage a project by taking a sizable but coherent and cohesive concept&#x2F;feature&#x2F;requirement&#x2F;design&#x2F;plan, shatter it into a thousand incohesive random fragments of varying sizes (all estimated to be bite-sized, but true size unknown until they&#x27;re actually done).<p>Then everybody grabs a few fragments and works on them, placing them somewhere more-or-less where they&#x27;re hopefully supposed to be, hoping that in the end everything will come together somewhat similar to the picture on the box.  Then everybody has to try to duct-tape and glue them all back together again on a herky-jerky schedule, like doing a puzzle with constant interruptions and distractions for the agile rituals.<p>The results aren&#x27;t necessarily worse than waterfall&#x2F;BDUF, but not necessarily better either.  There is in truth a lot more potential to course-correct along the way.  But since everyone&#x27;s spastically going different distances in different directions at different speeds on as-yet-unconnected fragments of varying sizes, and no one can see the big picture, that theoretical course correction en-route is not nearly as powerful as it sounds.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some debates about shorter vs. longer sprints.  The die-hard agile people tend to push for the shortest sprints possible or even shorter, leaving no time whatsoever to clarify requirements, work out integrations, or do any QA&#x2F;testing.  No time for thought at all, just spit out some code, any code, as fast as possible and then it&#x27;s review&#x2F;demo&#x2F;retro time.  The veterans push for longer sprints, with time to understand and coordinate, experiment and test.  But that gets a lot of pushback for not being agile enough, so we usually end up somewhere in the middle.  And a lot of things don&#x27;t fit neatly into that timeframe.<p>Which in my opinion is not the worst thing, but also nowhere near as efficient or as effective as it could be if things were not broken into bite-sized chunks with arbitrary deadlines, but instead developed as parts of a cohesive whole.  Whether from the foundation up (risky) or by building vertical segments and linking them together.<p>&quot;Move fast and break things&quot; indeed.  That&#x27;s the state of the art - breaking things as fast as possible.

Newport calls it the &quot;Hive Mind&quot; in one of his books. The number of total tasks, from very small to very large, each individual has to accomplish in a week ends up far far greater than expected on the surface. And adding to that, they come in in an unpredictable way.<p>All this adds up to burnout, not just the number of hours.

Now, I&#x27;m at a startup--very much inspired by Cal Newport, and using AI and context awareness to make teams operate together more effectively (see bio)--and I&#x27;m working far more hours per week than before, but with less interruptions and less distraction, I&#x27;m able to focus and feel far less burnout despite the increased hours.<p>All this to say, we really need to rethink how we work, not just how much.</div><br/><div id="36008971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36008971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nostrademons</span><span>|</span><a href="#36008157">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009838">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36008971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36008971">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s both.

What&#x27;s the point in controlling the &quot;means of production&quot; when almost nobody can afford what you produce because they are not generating value within that economy?  This is something that the industrial era capitalists (who were generally terrible people, don&#x27;t read this as me trying to make heroes of them) understood enough to deal with in some proactive ways but which for whatever reason we seem to be mostly blind to currently as we rush toward another inflection point for modern capitalism.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s the reality that when a significant percentage of the population is becoming unhoused and starving there will be revolt and those owning the means of production will be violently eliminated by any means necessary (absent some sort of collective agreement to keep the majority comfortable). Large masses of people wanting for basic necessities for themselves and their families don&#x27;t just disappear through the cracks like they do on a smaller scale when a relatively small number of have-nots (relative to the whole of the economy) are easy for society to marginalize and ignore.<p>So it is really in everyone&#x27;s interest (even the interest of the increasingly consolidated group with the &#x27;means of production&#x27;) that we figure this stuff out moving forward and sooner rather than later. I&#x27;m not confident we will do so before widescale bad outcomes for everyone begin to occur, but when the system begins to become unbalanced enough to start shearing itself apart nobody will be unscathed, so it&#x27;s rather silly that we aren&#x27;t already working on real solutions.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36008036" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36008036" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">golergka</span><span>|</span><a href="#36007568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36007845">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009268">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36007727">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36008036">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36008036">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; whoever owns the means of production<p>This 19th rhetoric century doesn&#x27;t work in modern world, especially when you&#x27;re talking about creating software.

Someone had to work to produce that readily available food, I would think.<p>If he grew&#x2F;harvested his own food, then he’d be lucky if he never experienced a stressful or even deadly event of pestilence, drought, or even injury to himself rendering him incapable of doing the quite hard work of growing and harvesting it.<p>Producing food is hard work and modern technological capitalism can be seen as a process of creating more and more layers of abstraction between food producers and the mouths that need to be fed, and doing it more efficiently at that to generate more spare time for other activities like leisure or philosophizing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36008217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36008217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">capitalsigma</span><span>|</span><a href="#36007723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36007888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36007948">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36008016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36008217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36008217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would you prefer subsistence farming?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36008016" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36008016" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">toomuchtodo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36007723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36007842">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36009311">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36008016">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36008016">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Picking up traction.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.4dayweek.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.4dayweek.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;countries-that-are-embracing-or-experimenting-with-a-4-day-workweek.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;countries-that-are-embracing...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=4+day+week+pilot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=4+day+week+pilot</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=pastYear&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=4%20day%20week&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=pastYear&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=fal...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36009311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36009311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TensorPoint</span><span>|</span><a href="#36007723">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36007614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36009311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36009311">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure that reducing from 40 to 32 hours would have a big impact on salaried workers unless it became standard to take an additional day off during the weekend like Friday.<p>It would actually be a 10% minimum pay increase for hourly workers that work at least 40 hours per week.

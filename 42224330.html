Early systems could have evolved from markings on trees, like we still use on the Appalachian Trail, and other trails. Warnings for bears or tigers, symbols for different tribes on different paths. If you&#x27;ve hiked much then you&#x27;re aware that even experienced woodsmen can get lost as the season changes and a valley changes, or after a hard storm washes away evidence of a trail. Children, in particular, would have been at risk, but would have almost certainly needed to do work over distances, in particular fetching water, which is something that even today children as young as 5 are asked to do. Notches on trees would have been a likely starting point for a system of symbols to communicate.<p>When I was much younger I used to work as a hike leader for a summer camp in Virginia. We would take a small group of teenagers out for 7 day hikes, during which we could cover something between 70 to 90 miles (112 to 145 kilometers). At one time I knew that stretch of trail so well I thought I could walk it blindfolded. And yet, I only knew it in the summer. One year I went in the fall and I was astonished how different it was.

There are probably all sorts of things that were passed don&#x27;t orally that we can&#x27;t even imagine.</div><br/><div id="42226399" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42226399" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philipswood</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225411">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42226409">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42226399">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42226399">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A book that gives a nice view of these some of these memory technologies is The Memory Code by Lynne Kelly<p>I can&#x27;t get myself to link to the marketing blurb inspired summaries, but I love the book.

Nearly every consonant has a different sound between initial and final position, although many of these are inaudible to English ears. On the other hand, having been a consciously designed writing system, it does have a rationality that most traditional writing systems lack, such as the fact that all vowels are based on either ㅡ or ㅣ with additional strokes added as appropriate to modify the base vowel (the fact that a double stroke, e.g., ㅑ or ㅛ represents the single stroke vowel with a y- sound prefixed seems just brilliant to me).</div><br/><div id="42226772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42226772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unscaled</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225256">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225809">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42226772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42226772">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Consonants changing their sound based on position is not such an abnormality — that&#x27;s just basic phonology. This phenomenon (allophony [1]) is found in virtually every language, but it remains a bit obscure to laymen, since it is mostly undetectable to the language&#x27;s own speaker.<p>For instance, the phoneme &#x2F;t&#x2F; is always rendered by the English letter &#x2F;t&#x2F;, but that phoneme can be rendered in so many different ways.
In an initial position it would be rendered as an aspirated voiceless alveolar plosive [tʰ], equivalent to the Korean Jamo ㅌ in initial or intervocalic positions. An English &#x2F;t&#x2F; in other positions is generally not aspirated, but besides that the rendition is highly dependent on the speaker&#x27;s accent. MRP (&quot;BBC English&quot;) speakers render a &quot;final&quot; &#x2F;t&#x2F; (i.e. after a vowel or consonant, but not before another vowel) as as [ʔt] ([t] sound preceded by a glottal stopped) or even just as a pure glottal stop [ʔ]. In intervocalic position RP speakers would keep &#x2F;t&#x2F; as a simple [t] sound, but most Americans would change this sound into a voiced alveolar flap [ɾ]. Cockney speakers famously change an intervocalic &#x2F;t&#x2F; into a glottal stop (so you&#x27;d get something that sounds like &quot;woh-ah&quot; for &quot;water&quot;) and I didn&#x27;t even get into how &#x2F;t&#x2F; behaves when it follows other consonants such as the elided &#x2F;t&#x2F; in &quot;listen&quot; or the way some American speakers pronounce &quot;winter&quot;.<p>In all honesty, this is probably just as messy as what happens in Korean, it&#x27;s just that the Korean allophones are more foreign to us. Besides ᄋ, all the variations are regular allophones. As far as I understand ᄋ was indeed just reused for two different purposes (there is no &#x2F;ŋ&#x2F; phoneme that transforms to an empty sound in initial position).<p>I&#x27;d say that one thing that still makes Hangul hard, is that a lot of consonant clusters sounds sound the same when they come in final position. It makes pronunciation regular, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to know how to transcribe many words. The vowels ㅐ and ㅔ are also pronounced the same in most (perhaps all?) modern Korean dialects, but that&#x27;s a small irregularity compared to the redundancies of many other alphabetic writing systems.<p>In short, Hangul is much more regular than most alphabets. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is the most regular though — it&#x27;s hard to beat new writing systems designed by professional linguists for small language that didn&#x27;t have an alphabet before. Hangul is still an relatively older system that had to go through writing reforms, but still retrains some spelling complexities. And if you compare Korean to Polynesian languages like Hawaiian, with their extremely simple phonology and phonotactics (they have very few vowels and consonants and generally don&#x27;t allow consonant clusters and final consonants at all) - then
the writing system of these languages is much simpler — and almost all of them use the Latin alphabet with a highly regular orthography.<p>I think there is a more impressive trait of Hangul, that is highly underappreciated. It&#x27;s an alphabetic writing system that blends very well with traditional Chinese characters. Chinese characters are all monosyllabic (i.e. they represent a single syllable) and while that property is not maintained in Japanese (due to its vastly different phonology), it has been maintained in Korean and Vietnamese. Hangul lets you write each syllable with a single graphic block (even if that block contains multiple &quot;Jamo&quot; letters). All other alphabet systems that have been developed in languages that used Chinese characters (Such as Pinyin, Zhuyin or the Vietnamese alphabet) do not share this property. This means that when you try to add some alphabet letters into a document written Chinese characters, the result is extremely unpleasant typographically. It is not only harder to typeset nicely, but it&#x27;s also quite painful to read.<p>Although Modern Korean doesn&#x27;t blend Hangul and Hanja (Chinese characters) very often, I think this property made Hangul quite a lot more palatable as a replacement for Chinese characters in Korea compared to Pinyin or Zhuyin. Koreans didn&#x27;t have to throw your entire typographic and calligraphic tradition in order to adopt Hangul: A block is fixed-size (not proportional), the writing is easier to read both vertically and horizontally and you can keep writing it with brush strokes using traditional Chinese calligraphic methods and practices. It can even be mixed nicely with Chinese characters like Japanese Kana (and it would be more compact than Japanese Kana). Eventually Korean language reformers have chosen to mostly drop Hanja altogether, but when you still do need to mix Hanja in a Korean text, you can do it seamlessly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42225571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42225571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teleforce</span><span>|</span><a href="#42225256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225707">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225323">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42225571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42225571">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Alphabet writing is probably the most important invention perhaps even more so than the invention of wheel.

You bring up Turkish. It&#x27;s a good example. I&#x27;m sure most here know that prior to 1929 or so Turkish used the Arabic writing system. This is also an alphabet but a more complicated one (eg vowels aren&#x27;t typically written) and didn&#x27;t necessarily fit the Turkish language.<p>So they designed a Latin writing system that is entirely phonetic it was was profoundly successful at increasing literacy rates. A completely illiterate person could be taught to read and write Turksih in a matter of months.<p>I compare this to Taiwan that has high school competitions to see who can find a word the fastest in a dictionary because knowledge is required of the roots and symbols.

For the two claimants to the oldest alphabets — the Indus script [1], and the Proto-Sinaitic script [2] — there is ample evidence of broad usage and influence from existing cultures: the Proto-Sinaitic script developed as simplified hieroglyphics used to communicate with Canaanite slaves [3] in Egypt and was the origin of (probably) all modern alphabetic systems, and the Indus script developed from earlier potter&#x27;s marks over hundreds of years and has nearly a thousand years of archeological evidence, although there is some debate as whether it qualifies as an alphabet. This appears unrelated to any existing writing system in the region, and — if it <i>was</i> an alphabet — appears to have had no subsequent influence on any other writing system ever made. If archeologists are suspicious of even the Indus script, how on earth do these qualify?<p>We have plenty of examples of pottery with markings on it that aren&#x27;t alphabets. Cuneiform obviously, but also simply tradesman marks like the predecessors to the Indus script. What makes this &quot;seem like alphabetic writing&quot; as opposed to any of the other kinds of clay markings we&#x27;ve seen at the time? There are only four objects bearing the markings, with nothing else to compare against, in a supposedly &quot;unknown&quot; language!<p>If this really is an alphabet: what did it develop from?

The main scholar (Glenn Schwartz) who co-oversaw the &#x27;94-&#x27;10 excavation isn&#x27;t an expert in writing. He put it out there around 2010 and said &quot;maybe it&#x27;s alphabetic, idk&quot; and there was not much followup from the community. So he consulted with some writing experts who helped him with the 2021 paper where he goes over the evidence for different possibilities and suggests that the strongest argument is for alphabetic. The dating seems to be on firmer ground but the error bands on this and Wadi el-Hol can probably knock a century or two off the &quot;500 years&quot;.<p>A decent summary is the blog post below from another researcher who briefly was part of the same dig and a former student of Schwartz (so not entirely independent):<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollstonepigraphy.com&#x2F;?p=921" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollstonepigraphy.com&#x2F;?p=921</a><p><i>It is worth noting that in the past Schwartz has been reluctant to affirm that the four inscribed clay cylinders from Tomb 4 of Umm el-Marra are alphabetic (Schwartz 2010). Thus, he certainly did not rush to this conclusion.  Moreover, his most recent article about these is also very cautious (Schwartz 2021), as he moves through various possibilities (as discussed above).  But it is clear that he is now willing to state that this is the most reasonable position (i.e., it is Early Alphabetic).  And I concur.  That is, the most reasonable conclusion is that the Umm el-Marra clay cylinders are inscribed with signs that are most readily understood as Early Alphabetic letters (graphemes).  Moreover, since the Early Alphabetic alphabet was used to write Semitic, it is logical to conclude that this is the language of the Umm el-Marra inscriptions (the fact that they were found in Syria would also augment this conclusion, of course).</i><p>The full blog post is worth reading and summarizes the case for various non-alphabetic possibilities.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42224679" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42224679" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">w10-1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42224543">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42225188">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42224679">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42224679">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right.  4 clay cylinders inch-long, perforated, with geometric symbols on the outside, are not jewelry (otherwise found in the same tomb) but ... labels with a new form of writing because... they were found next to the pottery?<p>The article is brilliantly written to lead with the significance of such a find before providing evidence.</div><br/><div id="42224769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42224769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thaumasiotes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42224543">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42224742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42224769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42224769">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article is well cited.

Also Egyptian writing goes back perhaps 5000 years. That is a Semitic language so it stands to reason that it too would likely fall in the same category. Anyway I do love these kinds of archeological finds nonetheless. Interesting to see if Gobekli Tepe yields even older instances of written script? (If they ever get around to a proper excavation, that is!

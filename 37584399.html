The case had very thin plastic.<p>The mouse was a ball mouse, and it worked by shining an LED into a sensor on each of the X and Y axes. On sunny days the sun would completely overpower the sensor due to the plastic case being very thin and on overcast days it would not.

This was called Automatic Line Insulation Testing in the Bell System. The ALIT system ran in the hours before dawn. It would connect to each idle line, and apply, for tens of milliseconds, about 400 volts limited to very low current between the two wires, and between each wire and ground, measuring the leakage current. This would detect moisture in the cable. This was dealt with by hooking up a tank of dry nitrogen to the cable to dry it out.<p>Here&#x27;s a 1960s vintage Automatic Electric line insulation test system at work in a step-by-step central ofice. [1] Here&#x27;s the manual for automatic line insulation testing in a 5ESS switch.[2] 5ESS is still the major AT&amp;T switch for copper analog phone lines. After that, it&#x27;s all packet switching.<p>For fiber, of course, moisture doesn&#x27;t affect the signal.<p>This led to an urban legend: &quot;bell tap&quot;. While Western Electric phones were designed to not react to the ALIT test signal, many cheap phones would emit some sound from the &quot;ringer&quot; when the 400V pulses came through, some time before dawn.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Wt1GGdDa5jQ">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Wt1GGdDa5jQ</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manualslib.com&#x2F;manual&#x2F;2755956&#x2F;Lucent-Technologies-5ess-2000.html?page=15" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manualslib.com&#x2F;manual&#x2F;2755956&#x2F;Lucent-Technologie...</a></div><br/><div id="37594615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37594615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ColinWright</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585548">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37588065">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37590493">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37594615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37594615">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We still have a land line.

There was a big, dumb switch fabric, and &quot;markers&quot; which told it what to connect. Other microservices included trunks, originating registers (which listen to incoming dial digits), senders (which sent dial digits to the next switch), billing punches (which recorded toll call data for later billing), translators (which held routing tables), and trouble recorders (which logged errors.) Central offices had at least two of each resource, for redundancy. Resources were &quot;seized&quot; as needed from resource pools, with a hardware timeout and alarms to prevent resource lockup. If something went wrong in setting up a call, it was retried once, using different resources. If it failed on the second try, the caller got a fast busy and there was an alarm and a trouble recorder dropped a trouble card. Markers did not have persistent state. They started each call with a reset.

It took a few days to realize it was because the inverter had failed.<p>I’m fairly certain there are some FCC regulations that would require our installer to fix it, but that relationship soured during installation and I’d rather deal with an unusable garage remote than dealing with them for warranty work.</div><br/><div id="37588591" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37588591" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_whiteCaps_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585548">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37587905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37592146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37588591">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37588591">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some clip on ferrites on the inverter cables might help.<p>If you have any amateur radio neighbours they&#x27;d probably love to help you with a project like this.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37592146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37592146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LazyMans</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585548">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37587905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37588591">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37593724">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37592146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37592146">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you get a SDR, you can watch the interference and try things to help reduce it.

Back in the days of server rooms, a friend’s server for his company would reboot every day around 5pm. They checked everything they possibly could with the OS, they would be logged in and running checks on it and it would spontaneously go offline for about 5 minutes and reboot every day. Finally they decided to go stand in the presence of the server around the time it goes down every day. They watched a cleaner come into the room, unplug the server rack, plug in their vacuum and vacuum around the servers, and then plug the server rack back in.</div><br/><div id="37586223" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37586223" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krisoft</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585655">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37585751">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37586223">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37586223">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh I have a similar one. This one is first hand, I was in the room when we were debuging the issue.<p>We were developing a smart camera product which were counting traffic on a road. So for example a city council would install this camera somewhere on a road and it would generate statistics of how many lorries, and passenger vehicles, and motorbikes used that road.<p>One of our cameras exhibited a problem where it restarted every day around roughly the same time. It wasn&#x27;t exactly the same second though, in fact there was a clear pattern to it. One day it would restart at 19:12:10 and the next day two second later, then again the third day two more seconds later. (not the real timestamp and i don&#x27;t remember the real time deltas either, but there was a clear progression)<p>After much debuging we learned that the issue was that as the sun was settling some street furniture projected a shadow in front of our camera. Our software wrongly concluded that it is a vehicle and started collecting information about it for classification. But of course shadows creep a lot slower than real vehicles so it run out of memory before the &quot;shaddow vehicle&quot; has passed out of the frame. And once we run out of memory the system froze and then got restarted by a watchdog.<p>Turns out the pattern we have seen in the timestamps was caused by the angle of the sun changing which made the shadow trick our algorithm just a little bit later every day.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37585751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37585751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drivers99</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585655">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37586223">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37585959">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37585751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37585751">[34 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Definitely an urban legend at this point.

Even this vapor lock story.<p>Sorry but even before today, having a automotive engineer sent to a random person&#x27;s home over what clearly sounds like a quack letter seems implausible to me. The dictates of capitalism, human resources, and the politics of the workplace would make this difficult if not impossible. Even in the past when there was more human capital in support positions and more of a sense of customer service.<p>Way, way too many suspicious stories involve high-level people being involved in trivial issues. I just find it all pretty suspicious. Real stories tend to start with poor customer service at the dealership and being mocked by managers and mechanics. Not some unrealistic ideal white knight manager sending off engineers to people&#x27;s homes. Imagine how many weird letters a place like pontiac gets. They don&#x27;t have the manpower to do this if they actually chose to do it, and engineers might balk at the idea of doing at-home support too.<p>Pretty much any &quot;idealized Americana&quot; business story should set off BS alarms in us. &quot;Oh a trivial problem with your car? No problem ma&#x27;am, I&#x27;m sending our top engineers over tomorrow,&quot; doesn&#x27;t happen because its costly and unsustainable. Instead ask anyone who has odd car problems. Its endless painful calls and visits to dealerships and mechanics. There&#x27;s a reason we have lemon laws for cars. Its because whats described in this story doesn&#x27;t actually happen and people demand restitution.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that someone had a famous vapor lock shopping story (ive heard different versions of this story, usually about a housewife picking up her child from a nearby elementary school), but over the years these stories get modified into memetic structures based on dishonesty because most people are social capital seeking and having a humorous story provides them the immature ego boost they need. So &quot;wow my car had vapor lock when I make quick trips&quot; became &quot;So the CEO of Ford came to my house to look at my ice cream car...&quot; The latter is just more interesting in the market of storytelling.<p>That is to say, the ONLY reason this story is here is because its been modified to be memeticly attractive. A &quot;boring&quot; (i find old technology faults interesting, personally), but a &quot;boring&quot; story about vapor lock wouldn&#x27;t make it to places like HN or reddit, which are memetic responders (upvote&#x2F;downvote mechanisms) and lowest-common denominator (by this demographic) popularity machines. But dress up that boring story and now everyone is repeating it, often times claiming its their story and they know the people in it!

Basically, I was the &quot;mechanic of last resort&quot; for some issues. The most certain method of getting something fixed was to write a letter to someone at the top, or very close to the top. When the request rolled downhill to &quot;fix this&quot;, no one knew if this was a whim or something serious (like it was the CEO&#x27;s neighbor). So those service requests got absolute priority.<p>I remember one incident where that &quot;fix it&quot; letter came from high enough that I drove out to the customer&#x27;s house and swapped out their radio in their driveway. At night.<p>When GM bought EDS, Ross Perot ended up on the board. He&#x27;d do all sorts of silly things. Like when something went wrong with his car, he&#x27;d take it to a dealership. And report back to the board how <i>that</i> went. The first few times, they just told him to hand the keys to the valet at the executive garage and tell them what needs fixing. The plant I worked out of made radios. Other branches of the division that I worked for made engine computers and instrument clusters. If someone at the executive garage had a radio problem, one of my tasks was to go out to the assembly line, grab a radio, test it, then get it to the Kokomo airport for the GM jet to pick up. FedEx (tagline: <i>when it positively has to be there the next day</i>) wasn&#x27;t fast enough. That fleet of jets would carry parts from plant to plant.

We toil on and are almost done when at about 16:00 the chief officer turns up and informs us that we have to hurry because at 17:00 all electricity will be cut in the building!
Senior developer and me share a shocked glance.
&quot;Is this every friday?&quot;
&quot;Why yes! We conserve lots of energy that way.&quot;
Senior and me share another glance and on impulse I speak up.
&quot;Isn&#x27;t the weekly db cleanup scheduled for 16:30 PM on fridays?&quot;
The senior developer nods. We spend the remaining hour to fix the problem and then cancel this weeks schedule and manually shut down the DB server for the time being.
Every friday these guys cut the power to the building, causing all kinds of production issues with not only their Netware Server but also the DB server for their collections software (our product). As per maintenance contract we were required to repair the DB everytime which was a hassle and a waste of ressources on our behalf.
In the end it took another month or so until they relented and rescheduled the hard power down until saturday morning so that all servers could shut down properly even AFTER the backup jobs could complete (backup was also totally broken but they never did check or even perform a restore so they never actually noticed).</div><br/></div></div><div id="37585817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37585817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iforgotpassword</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585655">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37594488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37587335">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37585817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37585817">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Man I&#x27;ve heard this story so many times, this guy must have a million friends in a hundred countries he&#x27;s told this story to. :-)</div><br/><div id="37586172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37586172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dkarl</span><span>|</span><a href="#37585655">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37585817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37585924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37586172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37586172">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s more like a common experience.

There was no budget for hardware though, so it ended up running on a repurposed workstation in somebody&#x27;s office. One Tuesday even the cleaners unplugged it to vacuum and it didn&#x27;t power back up after being plugged in.

Nobody took it seriously until there was an inventory of machines taken and we found that a large amount had significantly less memory installed than they should have, somebody was stealing half the memory sticks from each.

It was absolutely fine 99.9% of the time, but one time in a thousand it wouldn&#x27;t even try to start. No clicks, no indication that it even knew I was in there turning the key. Just dead. And then seven or eight hours later... it would start fine, as if nothing ever happened. Couldn&#x27;t correlate it to anything.<p>Had it towed to a service center a few times when this happened. Every time, by the time they got around to trying it (a few hours later)... it would start fine, with nothing to diagnose.<p>Then, it was 99% of the time it was fine. I was with a group of folks car-camping off road to fly a human powered airplane for a couple days, and... no start. Finally started -- with no sign of any problems -- around noon the next day, and I high-tailed it out of there a day before the rest of the group, because getting stuck there &#x2F;after&#x2F; the rest of the group would have started pushing my comfort level. So at this point it&#x27;s actually interfering with my life.<p>I&#x27;ve tried all the usual stochastic troubleshooting (swapping out fuses, light to moderate percussive maintenance, alternate keys) and nothing. Finally it fails to start in my driveway, and I get it towed to an independent mechanic. It&#x27;s short tow, and it fails to start when it gets there! So now he&#x27;s seen the problem, and is as puzzled as I am. Of course, when he tries again the next morning, it starts fine.<p>He proposes two possible fixes: replacing some ECU module, or replacing the fuse box itself (under the theory that it&#x27;s the connector or connection into the bottom of the fuse box that is having some moisture ingress or intermittent connection). Of course whatever we choose, I won&#x27;t know if it was right or not until the next time I&#x27;m stuck. The ECU is multiple thousands of dollars, and the fuse box is &lt; $200 with labor, so I make the easy choice.<p>This was six or seven years ago, and that car is still my main and only car.

Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations. The existence of confounders is an important quantitative explanation why correlation does not imply causation. Some notations are explicitly designed to identify the existence, possible existence, or non-existence of confounders in causal relationships between elements of a system. &#x2F; Confounds are threats to internal validity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Confounding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Confounding</a><p>Here is a sketch of a statistical model that shows a confounder (a variable affecting both the dependent and independent variables)<p><pre><code>     S = f(H, I, T)

    `S`: car starting or not (dependent variable)
    `H`: how hot is the car engine (independent variable)
    `I`: ice cream type chosen (independent variable)
    `T`: time taken to buy the ice cream (a confounder)
</code></pre>
Explanation: `T` influences `S` because a shorter time leads to `H` (a hotter engine, which is prone to vapor lock). And `T` also influences `I` (type of ice cream chosen) because the placement of vanilla ice cream allows for quicker purchase.

This shop has been in charge of support of a built-to-order native Win32 application (in Visual Basic or Delphi or something like that) initially developed by another previous company that had long disappeared.<p>One day a coworker got a support call from a user. Far from mythical outbursts of irate customers, an understandable the voice at the other end of the line remained extremely calm and eager to help resolving the issue, although you could feel a gleam of despair in the back of her voice.<p>The woman at the other end of the line had to input troves of data daily in a specific form in the application, basically taking a stack of whatever field-ridden paper forms they received and entering them into the system via the equivalent digital form manually.<p>She was adamant that every time she attempted to input a specific, optional date the form would close on its own, losing all of the input data. To make matters worse the specific date was the last one to be entered, thus all the already-repetitive hard work of inputting an entire form was getting even more annoying.<p>To make matters even more complicated, she was working part-time, in rotation with another person covering for days she was off. The other person never encountered the problem!<p>So their solution for years had been that the woman who was reaching out to our support would input everything but the affected date field, save but not validate the form, and place the paper form in a special basket; the second person would then go through the paper stack again and fill the missing dates.<p>They would go to the extent of telling people who submitted the form that the affected date would lengthen the form processing by a few days. Somehow this flied quite well as people would understand that this was a case where the date would imply more work (as in, <i>actual</i> work, e.g cross-checking more stuff or more internal paperwork or whatever) on our customer&#x27;s side.<p>In any case, this solution would stop working soon as the woman was going to go full time again and the other person in rotation would move to do something else. The customer had put up with this for an absurdly long time but now they were painted into a corner so they were left with hardly any option but to reach out for support.<p>We couldn&#x27;t hardly believe this was happening, but the person was very articulate and came up with a quite complete description of the situation that in most support cases you only dream of having. So my coworker dove into the code base, which was not ours and only received the occasional bug fix or small development to keep the software compliant. He could not find anything in the code, he could not reproduce anything locally, the date field - of any of the other fields for that matter - looked like any other standard field, but there must have been <i>something</i>.<p>Confounded, the only thing we could think of was that it only happened on the user machine somehow. He asked to remotely connect and try it on the user&#x27;s machine. No dice. He asked for the person to do it, anxiously watching as the user cautiously moved the pointer towards the date field when suddenly the form vanished! He went at it again and did the exact same thing, down to when things are clicked or typed and whatnot, but nope! But the user could still reliably reproduce it, over and over again.<p>Could it be that doing things through a remote connection affect the ability to reproduce? Out of options, he asked for the other person - which likely was at the office that day - that used to input the form to come over and input the same thing directly, watching the screen as fields filled up. It looked _exactly_ the same as when the usual user was doing it, but <i>it worked</i>.<p>We now could not see any other option but to move the investigation on site. Two people were tasked to that end to cover all possible grounds and brainstorm on the spot.<p>Arriving on site, they were greeted by this very amenable woman affected by the bug. They entered a small, poorly lit office, one taking a seat next to the user and the other standing due to the lack of space, and watched the user as she powered up an absurdly small, overaged CRT screen, then booted the ancient PC. As the user started typing on the $5 keyboard, moved the creaky mouse around they could not help but feel compassion as they saw the daily stack of paper forms that had to be entered every day, all day long, using such poor equipment and inhumane conditions when the customer company was throwing seemingly endless and voluminous amounts of money at our employer.<p>Focusing on the actions on the screen, the team member leading the investigation went through all stages of bewilderment and despair as the user arched forward to aim at the impossibly tiny date field on that tiny old screen, and just like that, the window vanished. His mind helplessly racing, in the stillness of the moment a voice raised up from behind:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Can you do it again?&quot;
</code></pre>
Said the one standing up.<p>So, with unabated calmness only zen masters can achieve, she nodded, proceeded with moves repeated a million times over, and the window closed again.<p><pre><code>    &quot;Yup, I got it&quot;.
</code></pre>
You see, one of the requirements for this digital form was to match the paper form in layout <i>and wholly fit in the screen</i>. To achieve that, the font size and UI element dimensions were dialled down. On the user&#x27;s small, poor, aging screen in a badly lit environment and with an impossibly bad mouse this made UI elements spectacularly hard to interact with, especially the date picker drop down. So when reaching to that specific optional date picker in a specific place of the screen the user had to lurch forward a bit to take a good look <i>and</i> lurch a little bit further and to the right to extend the arm and click to make the date picker appear. As it turns out the affected user was a bit overweight and with this very movement her - <i>ahem</i> - &quot;sizeable&quot; right breast ever so slightly brushed against a key on the right side of the old, mushy keyboard, in a way that made it register a keypress without any audible or haptic feedback. That keypress - which I can&#x27;t recall which it is - turned out to be what closed the form.<p>We could have patched the software to prevent that from happening. We didn&#x27;t. Instead a report was produced that in no uncertain terms - but not pointing at the <i>actual</i> &quot;mechanism&quot; - a combination of hardware and poor, non-ergonomic work environment was identified as the root cause; and not just that, but the reason she was working part time was medical and largely caused by these terrible work conditions, so we added a note &quot;as a courtesy&quot; they could maybe end up being liable for any health issue that would &quot;hypothetically&quot; come up. She got a new computer and display, a proper keyboard an mouse, a better desk and chair, and, I seem to recall, an additional light. The customer complied, reported the issue as fixed, and as far as we know the issue never occurred again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37593999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37593999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">killjoywashere</span><span>|</span><a href="#37594922">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37586241">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37593999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37593999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Late to the party, but wikipedia article for the root cause analysis when someone accidentally stumbles on this thread in 7 years:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vapor_lock" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vapor_lock</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37586241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37586241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rsynnott</span><span>|</span><a href="#37593999">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37592174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37586241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37586241">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Vanilla, being the most popular flavor, was in a separate case at the front of the store for quick pickup.<p>This feels very contrived; who organises a supermarket like that? &quot;Where&#x27;s the ice-cream?&quot; &quot;Which flavour?

I got a new Corolla and went on my merry way. But on the third day I found the steering stuck and extremely hard to maneuver. Scared the heck out of me, so I went back to the dealership.
They inspected the car and informed me the next day that there was nothing wrong with it and asked me to pick it up. I drive out of the parking lot, and again the steering gets stuck, and I just circle around and give them the car back, showing the live problem.
They inspect it another day, and aren&#x27;t able to find anything wrong, and ask me to pick it back up.
Sure enough, I haven&#x27;t even gotten to my home yet and the problem reappears, so I drive it back to the dealership.
This time they open up the car, the steering wheel and changed somethings in it and asked me to pick the car back up. Took me 4 mins of driving to land back in the same problem after which I made them refund my money.<p>I decided to shelve a few extra bucks and purchased a Camry from the same dealership. The second day while I was parking my new Camry, I found the same issue of the steering wheel getting stuck all over again, with this new car.
So this was surely a me-problem, and not the car problem. After some analysis I relaized that I was turning off the car at red lights, without shifting to park. So when I turned it back on, the steering would lock itself. But if I shifted to park first then it would work perfectly!</div><br/></div></div><div id="37585581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37585581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yosser</span><span>|</span><a href="#37592174">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37585581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37585581">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So this guy never ever restarted his car after a short interval except for when he bought vanilla ice cream?

And if that software comes from a dominant player, you’ll just have to deal with that by the way.)<p>There&#x27;s a temptation to conflate the software license with the software business. This is natural, but places <i>software</i> as the primary value in the chain.<p>From a business perspective the software though is a cheap part of the chain. And the least interesting part.<p>I don&#x27;t pick say accounting software based on price. Or access to the source code. I base it on effectiveness. And a big part of that effectiveness is that staff can run it. And when it all goes wrong there&#x27;s someone to call. I&#x27;m buying a -relationship-, not software.<p>Thats why RedHat is a business. They&#x27;re not selling Linux, they&#x27;re selling the reliability, longevity, services, support etc.<p>In truth the license <i>doesn&#x27;t matter</i>. My accounting software might be open or closed. My supplier doesn&#x27;t sell me based on the license. They sell me by convincing me that everything just works, and when it doesn&#x27;t they&#x27;ll be there to fix it.</div><br/><div id="41960907" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960907" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whoitwas</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960754">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960855">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960907">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960907">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">License does matter.

The open source community depends on commercial support. Essentially all of the bigger projects indeed get a lot of their contributions from the companies that use, build, and depend on these projects. It&#x27;s how the software world can collaborate with their competitors on the things they don&#x27;t compete directly on.<p>This isn&#x27;t charity, they are literally using more OSS software than they produce their own software. By several orders of magnitude in most cases. Companies like Google have many millions of lines of code in proprietary in house code. But they depend on an even larger amount of code in OSS form.<p>E.g. Android and Chrome OS are based on Linux. Those products are built on many thousands of open source packages. And of course Google is contributing to lots of them and created a few themselves. Chrome is open source because webkit was open source because Apple forked KHTML from the KDE project.<p>Open source without commercial companies contributing would be much more of a fringe thing.<p>VC funded OSS companies are a bit more challenging. These companies are perpetually confused about their licensing and need to keep things proprietary and open at the same time. These projects get a lot of attention because of the VC money but technically they only represent a tiny fraction of the OSS community.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hresvelgr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960681">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960599">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960604">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And it&#x27;s also not great when companies that are positioned as implementation open source and cloud closed (read: AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP reseller) also construct strange licenses that are inherently against traditional OSS values.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">portaouflop</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960604">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960707">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960599">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That the „commodify your complements“ strategy</div><br/><div id="41960691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jeffreygoesto</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960554">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960707">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960691">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I cite that essay always when &quot;but this should be open source&quot;

I use predominantly open source software on all my computers with some small exceptions. I used to rely on some cloud services because of the convenience and nothing else. But leaks started becoming way too common and what I can say about all places that I&#x27;ve worked at, data is handled really badly. If you pair that with some OSINT skills, you can learn pretty much anything about anyone from a single leak. So over the past few years I&#x27;ve been slowly cutting down my dependency on cloud services. Nextcloud was the first big step, a zfs pool for backups, a few custom protocols for alerting and kill switches and that&#x27;s it.<p>On paper this sounds really good but there&#x27;s a lot of overhead when it comes to maintenance. &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s just one more docker-compose.yml, big whoop&quot;(yes kubernetes is pointless overkill if you are the sole user). I&#x27;ve said that too many times and it&#x27;s not true cause it only takes one small thing that you overlooked and you have to spend a day or two to put everything back up together.<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that open source can be a good alternative but open source does not mean free or cheap. For instance, I&#x27;ve gotten really into drones and radio communications lately. Take hackrf and the baby brother that is flipper zero - they are both completely open source but neither of them is cheap. In fact, they are really expensive - they are effectively open source ASIC&#x27;s. I&#x27;m willing to bet that north of 80% of the cost is down to the software and not the hardware - because polishing a piece of software to the point where you can pick up a product and use it without effort or a steep learning curve, involves a ton of work on behalf of developers and UX&#x2F;I people.<p>And you can&#x27;t really cut off all big tech - open source phones are BAD, you don&#x27;t really have a good alternative to google maps and waze, you still heavily rely on search engines and a few dozen services if you start digging deeper. There are also a number of services which do not have an even half-decent open source alternative. Also not everyone has the skills to set up and run these things.<p>I think the big case in favor of self-hosting whatever you can is that while open source is far from immune to leaks, if it resides in your private network(which it should) without access to the rest of the world, those holes will eventually be patched and you can take action in the meantime - stop the service, block a few ports, etc. The odds of you personally getting affected are pretty low. Now if a leak happens in big tech, there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it and by the time you learn about it, it&#x27;s often too late. Honestly, this is the number one reason I&#x27;m doing this to myself.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960687" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960687" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">apples_oranges</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960796">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960708">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960687">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960687">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Big tech relies on open source and, often enough, vice versa</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960708" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960708" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nrnrjrjrj</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960687">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960708">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960708">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thw problem is big tech can offer free as in beer hosted services.<p>You can use Google docs for free so it takes some dedication to self host that and pay for the server.<p>Now if big tech charged for everything things would be more like the old days where you might use small tech, such as a local hosting provider that does open source installs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dtquad</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960708">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960620">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960767">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">80% of Linux code contributions come from US big tech.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">larodi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960742">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960616">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Been ranting about this for years, did a keynote about it, actually did two notes at several venues, including an open culture festival, and all I got was a silent dis.<p>every now and then open source is suggested as superior, because being free. Zero comment on code quality, who wrote it, why it came to be in the first place.<p>Even the argument that a host running open source makes delivery more trustworthy is super biased - major cognitive dissonance is that services based on open tech are very often not open,  neither auditable.<p>There’s a lot of open source being controlled by same large corporations and the part that is not, does not constitute a service on its own.<p>Then we must admit it takes a lot of care taking care of services nobody else cares about (by means of support).<p>While open source is important for academia, I think open results are more important for government. Like I don’t care what somebody used to cater to this geospatial data, or that image. I care about the data that went in and went out.
Open data is much more important in the era of open weights and closed sources training sets.<p>The general public is often misled to equate open source to free beer. Well that is also not entirely correct given plethora of not so free licenses. Asp not correct as costs are greater when you put the personnel running that service in the equation. I can see how this argument does not fly well with socialist ideologies, but that’s problem of ideology, not of costs or technology.<p>Even if we consider only those open projects which are also free - these come with less guaranties than a pair of second hand shoes bought from random store.<p>Don’t get me wrong - open source is great and we use it daily, but comparing means of distribution with quality of service is really like comparing ябълки и круши (apples and pears in Bulgarian).

It’s an area we take rather serious here in Denmark. Now, I won’t get into the irony of everyone wanting to replace Chromebooks in our school systems because Google is evil when the replacement is very likely to be Microsoft who is as much of a snoop these days since Google actually sells similar forms of privacy to our education. What we do have as a real working alternative to both is locally developed education solutions which will work as well, if not better? Than Google’s Educational tools on Chromebooks. What we lack is a political leadership that will commit to this. Part of this is because we’ve only recently gotten a digitalisation minister, even though people spend far more time on computers than they do on their daily commute and we’ve had a transportation minister since basically forever. Another part is that many of the top advisors in public service tend to “job hop” between our leading industry companies and public service, leaving to many contracts heading toward closed software.<p>What our educational alternatives show, and they have been implemented in some places and in Greenland I believe. Is very much in line with what the article recommends at the end, as far as small incremental useful changes with clear and cut goals. What would you achieve with Nextcloud? Replacing everything you have in Azure AWS in one big step? Obviously that is going to go horribly. That’s not even how we migrated into Azure from on prem. What you can do, is to start by slowly moving your applications and services into moveable parts, by container rising them. Writing your run-books in Python rather than Powershell and so on.<p>Then there is the change management, which the article touches on, and which is always forgotten by decision makers. Partly because decision makers don’t know what IT is, well… I guess that is it really. Where in the past (and I’ve written about this a lot) SysAdmins and supporters were unlikely to want to leave their Microsoft training, I think we’re at a point in IT history where that is less of a case because so much is now done on Linux even if you’re deep into the Microsoft ecosystem. Similarity the Office365 platform is not in as much ownership of your employee base because many people under 30 will not have “grown up” with it. Where it would have been inconceivable to not use Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Outlook 5-10 years ago we’ve entered a world where we actively have to train employees in Office products because they are used to iOS, Android and MacOS and not “PCs”.<p>Again, you should start by doing things in small steps. Our Libraries have switched to Ubuntu on every public PC, and it has been a non-issue because many library users are equally unfamiliar with Ubuntu and Windows, and since most things happen in a browser anyway, the underlying OS isn’t an issue.<p>That is how you do it. Slowly with small steps, and yes, some of those steps don’t need to be open source. If you want to replace Azure or AWS then it’s much better to head to Hetzner (or similar) rather than to try and do it with NextCloud or similar. Because then your SysAdmins will not really need much retraining as that is not very different from what they already do in many cases where moving into the cloud has really just been moving a bunch of VMs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41960689" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41960689" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">7bit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41960699">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41960635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41960689">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41960689">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The regular IT environment in the European Parliament is managed by whole teams of professionals, it comes with training, and is supported by Microsoft partners and ultimately by Microsoft itself.

However, he doesn’t provide any factual evidence that the Parliament’s Nextcloud experiment actually lacked professional resources, training, or adequate equipment. Instead, he hints at this by describing common issues with open-source setups, leaving readers to assume the experiment suffered from similar shortcomings.<p>I would have appreciated some facts, or even sources for his claims, but there are none.

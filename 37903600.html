How would the situation in question work out, between a father and a child?<p>Suppose there are three brothers - Peter, James, and John.  Suppose Peter is wondering if it ever matters whether he asks his dad for anything.  Perhaps he thinks his dad is so powerful and so wise that he will always do the right thing and doesn&#x27;t need Peter&#x27;s advice.  Or perhaps he thinks his father is so distant and uncaring that asking him for help is useless.  So Peter decides, as an experiment, every day to ask his dad to do something nice for James, and never asks him to do anything for John.  What will happen?<p>It entirely depends on the relationship between Peter and his dad!  But at a minimum, it seems likely that Peter&#x27;s dad would resist his son&#x27;s attempt to control him, and would take a dim view of Peter&#x27;s insincere requests and desire to play with his brother&#x27;s fates.<p><i>Is</i> there any point in children asking their parents for things?  There is - if Peter is genuinely worried about a problem James is having and brings it to his father&#x27;s attention, action is all but guaranteed - especially if they are close.  There&#x27;s a world of difference between requests based on the pre-existing relationship and the feeling behind the request.<p>God is a person.  He knows when you&#x27;re running a study.  He knows when you&#x27;re genuinely concerned.  He knows you far more thoroughly than you know yourself, and responds - not the way a force under your control would, but the way a person would.<p>As a bonus thought, I have a young son who likes to take trips outside.  It is his favorite thing.  I know this.  At any moment of the day, I know he would probably like me to take him outside just then.  Sometimes I do, sometimes I am doing other things.  I am infinitely wiser than my (in this case, two year old) son when it comes to prioritizing going outside vs. doing other things, and I really do try to get him as much outside time as I can, in general.  And yet! In spite of all of that! It is perfectly true that he frequently causes me to take him outside by asking.  Despite all logic to the contrary, prayer can work - the same way, for the same reason.   There is something in the asking itself that changes the context and the priorities.<p>Incredibly counterintuitive things can happen when people are involved.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37905130" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37905130" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzelement</span><span>|</span><a href="#37904550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37904875">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37910841">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37907609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37905130">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37905130">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the simplest level, because the very idea of faith requires going beyond the point where you are able to operate on pure reason.

In fact, in order to help me write my previous comment (in another thread [2]), I fed some pdfs to claude-100k on poe.com in order to compare Italino Calvino&#x27;s &quot;Cybernetics and Ghosts&quot; with the esoteric ideas of Voevodsky. Since this is relevant to the discussion, I will quote it in full.<p>&gt; Claude: Unfortunately Italo Calvino&#x27;s lecture &quot;Cybernetics and Ghosts&quot; does not discuss the paranormal. The lecture focuses on exploring the relationship between literature, language, and emerging ideas in fields like cybernetics, information theory, and structural linguistics. The uppercase emphasis is mine.<p>&gt; Me: I do think there are parallels between Voevodsky&#x27;s interview and Calivno&#x27;s text:<p>&gt; Calvino says,<p>&gt; &quot;Now, some of you may wonder why I so gaily announce prospects that in most men of letters arouse tearful laments punctuated by cries of execration. The reason is that I have always known, more or less obscurely, that things stood this way, not the way they were commonly said to stand. Various aesthetic theories maintained that poetry was a matter of inspiration descending from I know not what lofty place, or welling up from I know not what great depths, or else pure intuition, or an otherwise not identified moment in the life of the spirit, or the Voice of the Times with which the Spirit of the World chooses to speak to the poet, or a reflection of social structures that by means of some unknown optical phenomenon is projected on the page, or a direct grasp on the psychology of the depths that enables us to ladle out images of the unconscious, both individual and collective; or at any rate SOMETHING INTUITIVE, IMMEDIATE, AUTHENTIC, AND ALL-EMBRACING THAT SPRINGS UP WHO KNOWS HOW, SOMETHING EQUIVALENT AND HOMOLOGOUS TO SOMETHING ELSE, and symbolic of it. But in these theories there always remained a void that no one knew how to fill, a zone of darkness between cause and effect: how does one arrive at the written page? By what route is the soul or history or society or the subconscious transformed into a series of black lines on a white page?&quot;<p>&gt; Claude:<p>&gt; &gt; You make an interesting parallel between Calvino and Voevodsky here. While Calvino is focused more on literature and ideas of inspiration&#x2F;creativity, there are similarities to Voevodsky&#x27;s perspective:<p>&gt; Both question prevailing notions or &quot;aesthetic theories&quot; about where artistic&#x2F;literary works come from (inspiration from some mystical source for Calvino, materialist paradigms for Voevodsky).<p>&gt; They see a &quot;void&quot; or &quot;zone of darkness&quot; in these theories around how abstract ideas&#x2F;processes are concretely manifested in a work.<p>&gt; Calvino wonders how the soul&#x2F;history is transformed into written lines - paralleling Voevodsky&#x27;s exploration of realms like the paranormal&#x2F;supernatural that influence human consciousness&#x2F;behavior but are not scientifically understood.<p>&gt; Their stances acknowledge gaps in conventional understandings and an openness to alternative explanations outside dominant frameworks.<p>&gt; So while focused on different domains, they both exhibit a skepticism of dominant ideologies and a willingness to consider non-traditional influences. There is a parallel curiosity about gaps or unknown processes connecting the abstract&#x2F;internal to the concrete expression. This relates to Voevodsky&#x27;s open-minded investigations into areas like the paranormal that lie outside standard paradigms. NICE OBSERVATION OF A PHILOSOPHICAL SIMILARITY IN THEIR PERSPECTIVES.<p>To make this comment homologuous to my previous one ([2]), I&#x27;ll punctuate it with an excerpt from Grothendieck&#x27;s &quot;The key to dreams&quot;:<p>&gt; Act of knowledge and act of faith<p>&gt; (16 May) I wrote yesterday that there was no other key for the &quot;great dream&quot; than the spiritual hunger of the soul. When, still under the impression of the dream you have just had, you know how to listen to the humble voice of this hunger, then, even without knowing it, you are turning a delicate and sure key. And I wish you the grace not to stop halfway, before the bolt is erased and the door, locked for a lifetime, opens...<p>&gt; I have also thought about faith in the dream. When I woke up under the sudden influx of an emotion so great that my soul could not contain it, I knew immediately, in an unquestionable way: this dream was speaking to me, and what it was telling me with such overwhelming power, it was important, it was crucial that I become aware of it. I knew this, not because I had read it somewhere or thought about it one day, but through an immediate and certain knowledge. Just as it happens, when someone speaks to you (and it matters not whether you know them or are seeing them for the first time), that you know in a sure way, without having to question yourself, that what they are telling you is true. This is not an impression, more or less strong or convincing, but a knowledge. Impression can deceive, but not this knowledge. Certainly, you yourself must be in a particular state, a state of openness, or rigor, or truth (call it what you like), to be able clearly to distinguish, without any shadow of a doubt, between a simple impression and such an immediate knowledge. Such discernment, whether perceived in the field of consciousness or remaining subconscious (and it matters little here), is not of the order of reason, or of an intuition of intellectual nature. It is an act of spiritual perception. In that instant, the spiritual eye in us, which perceives and distinguishes the true from the false, is open or ajar and sees.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cifma.github.io&#x2F;Papers-2021&#x2F;CIFMA_2021_paper_13.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cifma.github.io&#x2F;Papers-2021&#x2F;CIFMA_2021_paper_13.pdf</a><p>&gt; Abstract. A great number of methods and of accounts of rationality consider at their foundations some form of Bayesian inference. Yet, Bayes’ rule, because it relies upon probability theory, requires specific axioms to hold (e.g. a measurable space of events). This short document hypothesizes that Bayes’ rule can be seen as a specific instance of a more general inferential template, that can be expressed also in terms of algorithmic complexities, namely through the measure of unexpectedness proposed by Simplicity Theory.<p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37903794">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37903794</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37910981" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37910981" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dove</span><span>|</span><a href="#37904550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37905207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37905496">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37905439">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37910981">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37910981">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is the definition of faith used by the irreligious -- as hostile a definition as if you asked one political party to explain the beliefs of the other!  An insider, and particularly a Christian, would never define faith that way.<p>Speaking as a Christian myself, I would say faith is <i>belief in motion.</i>  And I would say that faith doesn&#x27;t oppose rationality and evidence, but is rather sort of orthogonal to it.<p>Let us suppose you believe there is a horrible and dangerous pandemic going on outside your house.  You rationally are afraid to go outside.  And then as days pass, you gather evidence that the pandemic has subsided and things are safe now.  At first you don&#x27;t trust it.  And then you think it might be true.  And then probably true.  And then virtually certain.  That process of gathering evidence and becoming more certain is rationality.

It can happen when you first hear a hint that things are better, and in a reckless rush of hope, you run outside.  It can happen long after you are certain certain certain and fear keeps you inside too long.  These are both examples of bad faith, unhealthy faith, faith misused.  A Christian speaking of faith really means healthy faith - you go out when you should.<p>Sound faith doesn&#x27;t imply a lack of evidence, or complete evidence either.  It&#x27;s about deciding the evidence is sufficient and moving forward from there.  And it&#x27;s not <i>only</i> that - it&#x27;s faith <i>in</i> something.  If you step outside because a certain analyst convinced you it was safe, and you later take that same analyst&#x27;s advice on diet, and on this, and on that, and it keeps working out - you are growing in faith in that analyst.  Eventually, you may trust them quite a lot.<p>This is what I would say faith is: belief in motion, working towards building trust.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37905439" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37905439" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">burkaman</span><span>|</span><a href="#37904550">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37905130">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37905207">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37905795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37905439">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37905439">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand what you mean but I don&#x27;t think I agree.

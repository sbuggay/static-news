In every industry you see people that live and breathe by their jobs, and why not. But especially in IT, there&#x27;s this weird syndrome of &quot;the revenge of the nerd&quot; where many teenagers were nerdy and UNcool and now they&#x27;re in tech and they can have big positions in big name companies and whatnot and it seems that working in Tech is the new metric for professional achievement.<p>And it&#x27;s so easy to see the narrative as &quot;only monomaniac nerds make it&quot; because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re told and what we hear. But the truth is, many more people are invisible because their work in tech is just a function&#x2F;job&#x2F;utility rather than a revenge over their own teenage years and&#x2F;or a complete dedication.<p>I personally grew from the former category to the latter and I&#x27;m so much better in my life.

No, not really, we know how awful all those municipality&#x2F;small office tech is, partially because yes, those mythical &quot;well-known&#x2F;tested&quot; tools are pretty bad (also, it&#x27;s ironic to call C&#x2F;C++ with their share of footguns well-understood).

We call them Dark Matter Developers. They don&#x27;t read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don&#x27;t go to user groups, they don&#x27;t tweet or facebook, and you don&#x27;t often see them at large conferences. Where are these dark matter developers online?
</code></pre>
&quot;another kind of developer than the ones we meet all the time&quot; sounds incredibly condescending and wrong at the same time. We all meet them literally all the time. They are our co-workers. Never did I work in a team where the majority of my peers were avid conference speakers and bloggers, quite the opposite. It&#x27;s just called normal human beings with hobbies other than only computers. They are not dark matter, because we can see them all the time. They are the norm, not an abnormality. This whole blog post has a tone to it which doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.<p><pre><code>    &gt; The Dark Matter Developer will never read this blog post because they are getting work done using tech from ten years ago and that&#x27;s totally OK
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s incredibly judgemental. These are normal human beings who are not some mindless dumb people who don&#x27;t do anything except work go home and sleep. They read posts like this and they don&#x27;t necessarily use 10 year old tech as Hanselman suggests in his condensending ways. They are just not such a narcissists who need to sign up on every social media platform and constantly tweet about a shitty podcast and making shitty tiktoks to get a feeling of worth in their life.

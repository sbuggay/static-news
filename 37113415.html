We released a new product with a known, quite bad security vulnerability (I&#x27;d made sure our product team was _extremely_ aware of this), as well as no monitoring to speak of. The deadline had been communicated for around one year, but nobody had ever really discussed the significance of the date, other than it was what we were all death-marching to, and we needed to deliver.<p>What did that date turn out to be? The head of product management&#x27;s birthday, which was revealed to the rest of the company on the highly-celebrated the launch date. People were just kissing ass. I left several months later.<p>It feels unconscionable to me that a company could have launched an incomplete, insecure, customer-facing product just to give a birthday gift to a leader, but I suspect this sort of thing is common.</div><br/><div id="37117887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37117887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus_holmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#37115871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37116099">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37117887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37117887">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a whole management philosophy around deadlines; that setting a hard deadline will make the project predictable. For non-engineering projects this is often true. For engineering projects not so much.<p>Non-technical managers have a hard time with software engineering projects because they&#x27;re opaque and unpredictable. Opaque in the sense that no matter how many progress reports they get, the manager will never understand what progress is actually being made (because they can&#x27;t read the code). And unpredictable because development is inherently unpredictable.<p>By setting a hard deadline managers seek to control the project. Engineers will come to them with &quot;we can&#x27;t release this by the deadline because $technical_gibberish&quot;. But the temptation is always to just stick to the deadline and refuse to extend it, because once you extend it once then everyone knows it isn&#x27;t actually a hard deadline and the deadline will get extended again and the thing will never get released.<p>My worst case was one project where the management team decided that we could skip the testing phase and just test on prod after launch, because that would allow us to meet the deadline. Obviously the application completely failed because there were thousands of bugs in it that hadn&#x27;t been caught. The post-mortem was a total blamefest. The project got canned and people got fired. All that effort for nothing, just because they wouldn&#x27;t extend by a few weeks.

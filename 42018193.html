You can see it by robot vacuums becoming a commodity but also by one of the largest players doing something that could be read as preparing to shift from just hardware to services.<p>And, since the vast majority of investment is only done on the promise of providing hypergrowth and 100x to 1000000000x (add some more 0s to that) ROI, I&#x27;m not sure if some entity just selling decent robots without cloud tethers would receive any funding at all.
You can definitely make such a business profitable, but you can&#x27;t make it the absurd amounts of profitable, investors with deep enough pockets to fund hw development upfront are seeking.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42048441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42048441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">treesknees</span><span>|</span><a href="#42048768">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42048848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42048441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42048441">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My Eufy vacuum app helpfully tracks runtime hours and notifies me of different maintenance tasks as they become required, like wiping off sensors (every 35 hours) or cleaning filters and brushes (every 20 hours) or replacing filters (every 350 hours.)<p>Maybe it’s a ploy to sell more replacement parts, but the notifications do help remind me since overall I hardly think about the vacuum.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42048848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42048848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">milleramp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42048441">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42049242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42048848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42048848">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One additional improvement he could make is upgrade to a aerovac bin, it will work on a 500 series.

Absolutely! The Roombas are very easy to take apart and spare parts are easily obtained (both original and replicas).

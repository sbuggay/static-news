When I was about 14, my favorite uncle, you know, that cool uncle, he became a lawyer but when he was in college, he worked part time as a DJ at an underground FM rock station in Portland Oregon. Later, they went out of business and he was handling their chapter 11 or whaqt3ever. He knew I was a nerdly kid and was enthralled by all things electronics and said he would take me there and I could salvage some things which, now I realize he probably paid for but as a kid I had no idea at the time of course. They had this amazing TEAC 4 channel reel to reel, and boxes full of tapes. I grabbed that tape deck, the tapes and a sound board, a mic and whatever else. I was in heaven of course as a dumb kid. Later in college, I used that stuff and me and a some friends had a shitty punk rock band. But as a kid, way back in the 1970&#x27;s I, for whatever reason, decided to listen to some of the tapes before recording over them. What I found on them was, The Fuggs, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa and a lot more. I changed&#x2F;warped my life and led me to be in a punk rock band, but also, got my Masters in EE and eventually, a responsible life blah blah, but... It was so cool, like I some how tapped into some secret trove of... no idea. But I used that tape deck to make a demo tape that got us a single that well, no one cared about but for about 10 seconds, it was like I was cool. Sorry for the kooky memory. :)</div><br/><div id="37854338" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37854338" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">monitron</span><span>|</span><a href="#37852948">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37848734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37854338">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37854338">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing.

With a modern DAW, one is faced with decision paralaysis, the capability of layer forever, and ability to tweak for ever. With a four track reel-to-reel, you need to make decisions way earlier, you can&#x27;t just keep adding tracks (the noise floor grows), and you get shit done. Like Sgt.

Iâve been looking at picking up another VS recorder lately, probably the 1680, 1880 or 2480. The 2480 was really cool, with VGA out and mouse control. The Roland VM7200 Video Mixer came from that era as well and shares some of the architecture.<p>Yamaha had a smaller competing series of digital multi-track recorders around that time. The AW4416 being the last one made, and the AW1600 before that.

His points boiled down to:<p>- Tape is a dead simple concept that&#x27;s been around for ages. It will continue to be understood.<p>- Failures in analog media are more salvageable than digital ones.<p>- Importing a DAW session from 20 years ago and trying to reproduce the work while dealing with incompatibilities, DRM, drivers, etc is way harder than just spinning a reel.<p>- If you&#x27;ve captured the feel you&#x27;re going for in the initial recording, you don&#x27;t need the intricate processing options a DAW offers.<p>I mostly disagree with his first point. I&#x27;m not an engineer, but I&#x27;m under the impression that some precision work goes into the mechanics of these things. I can envision a future where the market just isn&#x27;t there to pay anybody to make them correctly. Finding repairs is already hard enough.<p>I&#x27;m not a massive fan of Albini, but he is a well-spoken guy who seems to know his stuff. My favorite musical work of his is probably &quot;Songs About Fucking,&quot; and his best production job is &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; by Whitehouse. Both are so noisy but audible. The professional&#x2F;alien sheen of the latter work is a major outlier in the genre of power electronics, which is usually very DIY and unfortunately rather murky despite the extreme frequencies employed.</div><br/><div id="37854513" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37854513" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marttt</span><span>|</span><a href="#37853207">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37854410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37854370">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37854513">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37854513">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for such a detailed reply. His (or other analog audio devotees&#x27;) thoughts on the environmental impact and ecological footprint of tape recording would be really interesting to hear.<p>It is tempting to state &quot;digital is more environmental friendly&quot;. But developing new hardware and software obviously bears an ecological burden as well, whereas that old analog gear can be used more or less &quot;as is&quot; for decades.<p>I&#x27;m interested in analog mostly because I feel DAW screens are tiring for the brain. And, as an occasional producer of a long-form radio program, I often think whether a show produced in a more &quot;analog manner&quot; (solely relying on my ears, not my eyes during montage) would have a different &quot;feel&quot;.<p>For that reason, CLI-only software like ecasound or mixer4 [1] have been interesting to me for a long time; so far, during real montage work, I have nonetheless always opted for DAW-based solutions, or maybe simple destructive audio editors. Still like the idea of not having to look at the waveform for making my cuts, though.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecasound.seul.org&#x2F;ecasound&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecasound.seul.org&#x2F;ecasound&#x2F;</a>, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acousticrefuge.com&#x2F;mixer4.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acousticrefuge.com&#x2F;mixer4.htm</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37854370" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37854370" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mypalmike</span><span>|</span><a href="#37853207">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37853840">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37854410">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37853834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37854370">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37854370">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might like his music too, which might be described as harsh guitar-driven industrial punk.

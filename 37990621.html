At the extreme end, I&#x27;ve fried a motherboard (shorted it somehow on first boot) and melted a laptop (tried to install Linux on it, apparently didn&#x27;t have the fan drivers or something). Then early 3Dfx cards were also a pain to get working reliably, especially with SLI.<p>It was just a rough time for everyone, lol. I think the only things from that era that actually worked well were my PalmPilot and Casio calculator watch :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37994496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37994496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irrational</span><span>|</span><a href="#37993364">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37994228">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37994259">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37993514">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37994496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37994496">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I managed a college Mac computer lab (it was in the school of education, I guess Apple had a lock on schools with those brightly colored iMacs, which is what we had) from 1998-2000 when I was in graduate school.

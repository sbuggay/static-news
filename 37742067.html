  - sexually abusive mothers and the idealization of motherhood

The guy never caught a break from persecution.<p>However wacky he became, Reich was one of the few in psychiatry to focus on prevention over treatment of mental illness. When he investigated the root causes of mental illness in his patients, he saw the conditions of modern life were often the source of the harm. He advocated a radical re-engineering of society so that it meets people&#x27;s fundamental social, spiritual, and organismic needs.<p>He saw fascism as a symptom of structural failures to meet these needs. Fascism is not so much an authoritarian political movement as mass mental illness. His model suggests that in such circumstances you&#x27;d see disordered thinking across the political spectrum. People&#x27;s tolerance for ambiguity diminishes, tribalism increases, and we grasp at simple solutions. This flailing fails to address the systemic problems leading to positive feedback that further corrodes the social fabric.

The material included copies of several of his books, including The Sexual Revolution, Character Analysis and The Mass Psychology of Fascism. Although these had been published in German before Reich ever discussed orgone, he had added mention of it to the English editions, so they were caught by the injunction.<p>Publishing the Mass Psychology of Fascism had him kicked from the German Communist Party before.<p>Another pretty random bit of information, i recently stumbled about his Sex-Pol movement in another context as the Mitrokhin Archive alleges that Arnold Deutsch (Recruiter of Kim Philby of the Cambridge five) was a follower of said movement.

Not only was Reich a quack, he was a member of a cast that weaponized sexuality against the population while calling it &quot;freedom&quot;. But, of course, sexual liberation was and continues to be a form of political control.<p>Augustine, himself once a libertine immersed in the unrestrained pleasures on offer in Carthage and, therefore, speaking not only theoretically, but from personal experience, observed that a man has as many masters as he has vices, and here lust and sexual vice in general are especially relevant. Thomas Aquinas, himself, by all accounts, a man of great chastity, remarked on the &quot;daughters of lust&quot;, that is, its consequences, among which are &quot;blindness of mind&quot;, &quot;rashness&quot;, &quot;hatred of God&quot;, and &quot;self-love&quot; (which is to say, a kind of pride and self-absorption). These are but two of the most famous scholars on the subject. The Marquis de Sade, however, turned these observations on their heads and attempted to use theater in this respect to corrupt the masses for purposes of control. One obstacle was that his reach was limited. A theater could only seat so many people. Enter the mass media. Now you could reach millions with titillating or downright pornographic content, and with smartphones, we face a deluge of free pornography, resulting in shocking rates of porn consumption and &quot;porn addiction&quot;, especially among men, with all its depravity and derangement. Wilhelm Reich takes his place alongside de Sade (along with others like Edward Bernays and Alfred Kinsey).<p>A Freudian and a Marxist, he saw the traditional, Catholic sensibilities of Austria as an obstacle to communist revolution. An opening for the revolution could be achieved only through demoralization, and he weaponized masturbation to that effect. Indeed, he saw the sexualization of the clergy as a means to this end and promoted this practice among young, impressionable seminarians, finding that, rather predictably, it had the desired effect of causing them to lose interest in the religious life. His female patients, however, were disgusted by his suggested form of recreation, so to overcome this reluctance and resistance, he developed the idea of the &quot;mass situation&quot;, something deployed to great effect during the sexual revolution. As psychoanalysis crept into the culture, so, too, did its bogus and destructive ideas about human sexuality. Sex, like drugs, caught the attention of such three letter agencies like the CIA who saw in these things methods of control and social engineering.</div><br/><div id="37747478" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37747478" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klysm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37743015">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37746636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37748680">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37747478">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37747478">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But, of course, sexual liberation was and continues to be a form of political control.<p>You lost me right here.

It&#x27;s filling the gaping hole that hunger has caused so you can go back to your default &quot;not hungry&quot; state. A little further down the article they mention:<p>&quot;The answer is straightforward: somehow, we are unable to experience pleasure, and we therefore confuse pleasure with mere satisfaction.&quot;<p>In light of this point, it is very easy for us to mistake &quot;unpleasure being reduced&quot; for pleasure. The lack of unpleasure feels pleasurable in a relativistic sense, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as being truly pleased with something.<p>There may also be something to discuss regarding eating being pleasurable -- biological processes have incentivized us to eat, and to eat things our body finds desirable. Therefore what appears to be a pleasurable desert is our body rewarding us for loading up on fats&#x2F;sugars as they are calorie dense.<p>Even if it feels pleasurable at the time, is that pleasure just satiety? When you start adding cultural layers to it, it begins to break down a bit.

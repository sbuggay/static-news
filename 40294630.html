Ledt assume that you’re discussing a topic like working hours. Your company says you have to work. 14h each day, and you argue that if you have to do that, you’ll be sleep deprived, make mistakes and be so low productivity that it wouldn’t benefit the company, especially since they would have to pay you more with a constant hourly wage than if you worked fewer hours and was more productive. 
The company argues: “STFU pessent, you’ll work when we say, how long we say and exactly how we say or you’re fired this instance, now get back in line before I duct your pay for the time you’re wasting by even thinking you’re worthy of talking to someone in management!”<p>Now in that scenario the worker has no power at all, even though it actually is as we all know today, a proven benefit to have resonable working hours for the company.<p>So if you have a union and all the workers can collectively go “we need to talk about work hours or we strike” you force through the policy that is ultimately beneficial to the company, even though management hates the idea of there being 6hours more per day that their wage slaves are not at the work benches.<p>Why would workers argue for fewer hours if it doesn’t end up costing the company net profits? Because they are humans, not machines, and not everything in this world boils down to pure profit driven motives.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40295467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sebtron</span><span>|</span><a href="#40295332">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295416">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295796">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295467">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It makes a positive difference for the employees.

I know its convenient in some populist fashion, but unless you understand the root cause of each of those, any sort of fix has no chance of arriving.<p>Unions make corporations extremely sluggish when they need to react quickly to sudden market shocks or changes of direction of companies, be it positive or negative (yes, includes firing people for which there is suddenly no work anymore). There are corporations that have them heavily and they are not the top of the cream when it comes to progress, agility nor salary pay.<p>The money is the key issue here - people want extra safety&#x2F;bargaining net as long as their ultra massive FAANG-like salaries are not touched. How many would agree with say 20% cut while working exactly the same, but being unionized? That&#x27;s maybe how much that additional burden is to the owners&#x2F;managers.

Another way is to view the input as simply a sequence of voltage readings. Extracting a useful signal from that is an exercise in exploiting redundancy in noisy data. [1] Software defined receivers work that way.<p>Analog radio (AM, FM, etc.) is a hulking big carrier weakly modulated by the signal. Analog TV, which was AM video with FM audio, had 80% of the power in the carrier. Analog UHF TV stations often had multi-megawatt transmitters to overpower noise by sheer RF output. Digital broadcast TV transmitters output maybe 150KW, because the modulation is more efficient.<p>Modern modulation techniques are insanely efficient. It&#x27;s amazing that mobile phones work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;6-450-principles-of-digital-communications-i-fall-2006&#x2F;1e8d60eb6c0a68cc48e81af039fd4af6_book_6.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;6-450-principles-of-digital-comm...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39824934" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39824934" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Simon_ORourke</span><span>|</span><a href="#39816655">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824251">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39824934">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39824934">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would it be possible to construct a rudimentary FM radio receiver with only the most basic parts ala Masters of the Air?</div><br/><div id="39825095" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39825095" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lormayna</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824934">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39825095">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39825095">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AM is quite easy (a diode and a capacitor can be enough), an FM receiver need a local oscillator that require some active elements (transistors) and a more complex circuit.</div><br/><div id="39825306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39825306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sebcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824934">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825095">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39825306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39825306">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Under what circumstances is a diode and a capacitor enough to make a radio receiver?</div><br/><div id="39825495" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39825495" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">helsinkiandrew</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824934">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39825495">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39825495">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A Foxhole radio was often made from a coil of wire (inductor), a razor blade and pencil lead (diode):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Foxhole_radio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Foxhole_radio</a><p>&gt; The aerial is connected to the grounded inductor. The coil has an internal parasitic capacitance which, along with the capacitance of the antenna forms a resonant circuit (tuned circuit) with the inductance of the coil, resonating at a specific resonant frequency. The coil has a high impedance at its resonant frequency, and passes radio signals from the antenna at that frequency along to the detector, while conducting signals at all other frequencies to ground. By varying the inductance with a sliding contact arm, a commercial crystal radio can be tuned to receive different frequencies. Most of these wartime sets did not have a sliding contact and were only built to receive one frequency, the frequency of the nearest broadcast station. The detector and earphones were connected in series across the coil, which applied the radio signal of the received radio station. The detector acted as a rectifier, allowing current to flow through it in only one direction. It rectified the oscillating radio carrier wave, extracting the audio modulation, which passed through the earphones. The earphones converted the audio signal to sound waves.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39825340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39825340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danbruc</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824934">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825495">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825456">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39825340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39825340">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you are building an AM crystal radio.

Without getting clever, we can only send or receive one signal, since any others would interfere with each other.<p>The trick is, can we do something to <i>shift</i> the bandwidth B to some other base frequency F such that B + F &gt; B? Or B + (N - 1)F &gt; B? And if we can do that, and then downshift from B + NF back to B, it means we can broadcast to multiple <i>channels</i>, and receivers can tune their antennas to F and downshift the decoded signal to 0 and receive it at the original bandwidth B.<p>A cheap way to do this is amplitude modulation, where multiplying a signal with bandwidth B by a carrier signal of frequency F shifts it up to the range F +&#x2F;- B and we can space channels apart by 2B to get however many channels our antennas allow for.<p>The real question is, why is it 2B and not B? Well that lies in some Fourier analysis, where the bandwidth of a signal extends into <i>negative</i> frequency ranges. But neverless, there is another trick, called single-side-band modulation (SSB) where we can shift a signal into the range F + B instead of F +&#x2F;- B, and demodulate it into -B, B to get the original.<p>And that gets us to the 1950s in terms of radio technology.<p>The trick behind FM is to understand we can get more bandwidth by shifting the frequency response not into a series of non-overlapping channels centered at carrier frequencies like AM, but to distribute most of the information across <i>many</i> non overlapping bands over the entire spectrum of the antennas. To do this we don&#x27;t modulate the amplitude of the carrier, but its frequency. This makes it possible to distribute far more bandwidth across a wide range of frequencies, and it&#x27;s how FM radio works today.<p>These concepts create the foundation for modern radio communication, We can modulate data signals to different bandwidths and receive them, provided we know where to tune to. And these bandwidths can either be continuous chunks of spectrum (AM), or interleaved (FM). The next step is to think in terms of time, which is to say that we can have receivers negotiate not only which ranges in frequency they care about, but which time frames they want to listen before waiting for their next time slot.<p>For those interested in the theory, the fundamental problem is that we can design antennas that can transmit or receive at some fixed maximum bandwidth, bounded by physics. The engineering problem is to find out how to share that bandwidth to maximize the number of receivers and&#x2F;or senders by sharing the same bandwidth. Amplitude modulation is excellent, but it divides the bandwidth up into a fixed number of channels of maximum individual bandwidth. FM is a bit more efficient in how it can allow many broadcasters to even more receivers choose which channels they receive. But for modern communications, where we need high bandwidth for distinct transmitter&#x2F;receiver connections, we need protocols to figure out how to share the bandwidth over the air and the two tricks are to divide that bandwidth by frequency (like AM and FM) or time (sharing the same frequency channels, but only picking the frames that we care about), or both.</div><br/><div id="39824356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39824356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duped</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824270">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39824356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39824356">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And for those even <i>deeper</i> into the theory, one question you might ask is, if we can divide spectrum and time to get some bandwidth B per channel, how many bits can we send&#x2F;receive over a distinct channel?<p>The answer is C = Blog2(1 + S&#x2F;N) where B is the bandwidth and S&#x2F;N is the signal to noise ratio determined by the environment (how much noise is present relative to the signal being transmitted). The crazy thing is this was proven in the 1940s and everyone interested should go read <i>The Mathematical Theory of Communication</i> by Claude Shannon. This is referred to as the Shannon-Hartley theorem, and it determines the channel capacity (C, in bits&#x2F;second) of any communication channel in the presence of noise.<p>The math concepts might seem heady, but it&#x27;s actually fairly approachable and available online. It&#x27;s fascinating that the fundamentals were proven out in one work nearly 80 years ago by a handful of people, and the math is not that bad.<p>The thing that makes this nuts is that if an engineer picks some target bitrate for a device, say a cellphone watching video, they can work backwards to determine the channel capacity they need, do some experiments to figure out noise, and then determine what the target their modem protocol needs to reach to be suitable. And this is how we get 5G and fiber or whatever comes next.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39824397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39824397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">femto</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824270">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824356">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39824397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39824397">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; divide that bandwidth by frequency (like AM and FM) or time<p>Ah.

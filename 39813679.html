* It was taken from an old-ish (US?) navy electric engineer-focused applied electronics course for training naval engineers.
* It was more focused on analog circuits<p>I remember I downloaded it all but after all those years who knows where it could be.

The coil has an internal parasitic capacitance which, along with the capacitance of the antenna forms a resonant circuit (tuned circuit) with the inductance of the coil, resonating at a specific resonant frequency. The coil has a high impedance at its resonant frequency, and passes radio signals from the antenna at that frequency along to the detector, while conducting signals at all other frequencies to ground. By varying the inductance with a sliding contact arm, a commercial crystal radio can be tuned to receive different frequencies. Most of these wartime sets did not have a sliding contact and were only built to receive one frequency, the frequency of the nearest broadcast station. The detector and earphones were connected in series across the coil, which applied the radio signal of the received radio station. The detector acted as a rectifier, allowing current to flow through it in only one direction. It rectified the oscillating radio carrier wave, extracting the audio modulation, which passed through the earphones. The earphones converted the audio signal to sound waves.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39825340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39825340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danbruc</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824934">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825495">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39825340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39825340">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you are building an AM crystal radio.

Reception of FM works much like AM except you need an FM detector before turning the signal into audio.  A circuit a little more fancy, than a diode (or rusty razor blade and wire) used in AM.  But not that much more fancy.  There are many ways to detect FM.  Most methods actually use the phase - the immediate relative change in the frequency - and not the actual frequency.  While the modern technique is a phase-locked loop, it can be much simpler.<p>A classic passive RC or LC or RL filter, will cause a phase shift.  Take the difference between two phases effectively decodes FM.  No active elements required.  With only RL filters it would be very inefficient. So you may need to be standing next to the transmitter if you don&#x27;t have at least <i>one</i> transistor or tube.  But one such tube or transistor would be plenty for a strong local broadcast.<p>If you have some capacitors, it gets easier.  Maybe paper and tinfoil rolled tightly, or flakes of glass or mica between thin slices of wood.

Because the distances involved are tiny compared to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) of that frequency (about 22 metres), the interaction is described as near field. An alternating magnetic field is the main coupling factor and almost no power is radiated in the form of radio waves (which are electromagnetic waves, also involving an oscillating electric field); that minimises interference between such devices and any radio communications at the same frequency or with other NFC devices much beyond its intended range.

I emphatically agree that the way the Path Loss Equation (Friis) is taught is misleading. I much prefer the way you interpret it, with the transmit antenna represented with gain and the receiving antenna having only an effective receive area. It&#x27;s much more intuitive because I can visualize a spherical shell of power radiating outward.<p>That said, a receive antenna does absolutely have &quot;gain&quot;, which is evident by the antenna receiving a stronger or weaker signal depending on its orientation with respect to the transmit antenna. The key is this: for an arbitrary antenna, the (transmit, if you like) gain has a one-to-one relationship to the &quot;effective receive area&quot; at a given frequency, so talking about area and gain are equivalent, if not intuitive. We usually assume for point-to-point links that the antennas are oriented at each other, and in such cases (for good aperture antennas), you are absolutely right that the physical area and effective area are approximately equal. For ideal wire antennas, however, the physical area of the antenna is 0, but the effective area is nonzero (because of magic).<p>Now, I disagree that the path loss equation violates conservation of energy. The link to the effective area and gain depends on the wavelength. When I increase the frequency of operation but I keep the gain of the antennas constant, the areas decrease, so my receive antenna is physically smaller and the power goes down. Not breaking physics. A lot of people will say &quot;path loss gets worse as you go up in frequency&quot;, and this is extremely misleading if not &quot;scientifically illiterate&quot; as you pointed out. Sure, there are molecular absorption bands from oxygen&#x2F;water that literally dissipate power in the atmosphere, but generally speaking, the path loss didn&#x27;t get worse, your receive antenna just got smaller.<p>Now wait a minute, what if I just made my receive antenna larger? Well, you can do that! The problem is that because gain and area are linked, efficiently receiving power in a given LARGE area (with respect to the wavelength) implies high gain. High gain implies a very narrow beam (more like a laser pointer than a normal dipole spilling energy everywhere). So it becomes really important that I &quot;point&quot; my receive antenna perfectly at the transmitter. Satellite dishes are really big, and they absolutely have to be pointed accurately at the satellite.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39828298" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39828298" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fourier54</span><span>|</span><a href="#39827445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39827772">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39830273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39828298">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39828298">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How can an equation that does not represent a balance of energy violate energy conservation?<p>With path loss equation I assume you refer to Friis equation which is just the ratio of power received at an antenna to power given to the transmitter.

And I&#x27;d mostly agree with you re mature industries and outsourcing. But in the instances I&#x27;ve given (and they were just off-the-cuff, but there are many more) I&#x27;d argue that they are new and developing tech that&#x27;s nowhere near full maturity. New modulation methods combined with newer polarization techniques have the potential to revolutionize spectrum management (that&#x27;s where many more channels can be made available in already-overcrowded spectrum space). With new meta materials the sky&#x27;s the limit—from new types of specialized antennae to optical lenses that are an order of magnitude smaller whilst bettering optical sharpness and abberations, and that&#x27;s just for starters.<p>Re cell phones, I&#x27;ll just say this. RF engineering went through a revolution about 10 to 15 years before cell phones became commonplace. The electronics shrunk in size by an order of magnitude, the RF front ends including its transistors increased their FT (transition&#x2F;cutoff frequency) by over an order of magnitude, and the noise figure of RF front ends was reduced to well below 1dB.<p>The net&#x2F;combined result of these three improvements in RF engineering was a truly remarkable achievement. Fact is, there&#x27;d be no smartphones or integrated GPS without these developments all having happened. I&#x27;d also add that by and large programmers simply haven&#x27;t a clue about this very special aspect of RF engineering. They just take for granted that the hardware does what it says, to them it&#x27;s  just a black box.<p>Programming, which cannot be really called engineering because many decades on, it&#x27;s still an undisciplined way of working that&#x27;s more akin to an art form than true professional engineering, can however provide the glitz factor that sells phones, but it&#x27;s completely lost without the state-of-art RF hardware substrate upon which it sits. Moreover, the next revolution in phone technology such as direct satellite services, will only be practical after a further revolution in RF hardware (what passes for some showy demos today is nowhere near the mark if the tech is to be widely adopted).<p>If you think I&#x27;ve been too hard on programming then I&#x27;d suggest you read this near 30-year-old SciAm article as starting point: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;247573088_Software&#x27;s_Chronic_Crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;247573088_Software&#x27;...</a>.<p>Thirty years on essentially programming has adopted some new techniques for developing software but the fundamental underlying problem of the lack of rigorous standards together with proven methods to solve problems by computer remains unresolved, and in some instances the software industry has gotten demonstrably worse.<p>I&#x27;ve not the time to put current references that support my claim but a search will soon find them—ones written by both authoritative people within the programming industry and elsewhere such as in computer science research.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39833863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39833863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amelius</span><span>|</span><a href="#39828996">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39829656">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39825850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39833863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39833863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can make a lot of money if you are able to implement the WiFi and cellular protocols in hardware, which are a complicated mess, and riddled with patent traps.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39825850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39825850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stavros</span><span>|</span><a href="#39828996">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824251">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39825850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39825850">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Antennas have always been black magic for me, and this article blew my mind with the &quot;capacitor you pull apart&quot;.

Without getting clever, we can only send or receive one signal, since any others would interfere with each other.<p>The trick is, can we do something to <i>shift</i> the bandwidth B to some other base frequency F such that B + F &gt; B? Or B + (N - 1)F &gt; B? And if we can do that, and then downshift from B + NF back to B, it means we can broadcast to multiple <i>channels</i>, and receivers can tune their antennas to F and downshift the decoded signal to 0 and receive it at the original bandwidth B.<p>A cheap way to do this is amplitude modulation, where multiplying a signal with bandwidth B by a carrier signal of frequency F shifts it up to the range F +&#x2F;- B and we can space channels apart by 2B to get however many channels our antennas allow for.<p>The real question is, why is it 2B and not B? Well that lies in some Fourier analysis, where the bandwidth of a signal extends into <i>negative</i> frequency ranges. But neverless, there is another trick, called single-side-band modulation (SSB) where we can shift a signal into the range F + B instead of F +&#x2F;- B, and demodulate it into -B, B to get the original.<p>And that gets us to the 1950s in terms of radio technology.<p>The trick behind FM is to understand we can get more bandwidth by shifting the frequency response not into a series of non-overlapping channels centered at carrier frequencies like AM, but to distribute most of the information across <i>many</i> non overlapping bands over the entire spectrum of the antennas. To do this we don&#x27;t modulate the amplitude of the carrier, but its frequency. This makes it possible to distribute far more bandwidth across a wide range of frequencies, and it&#x27;s how FM radio works today.<p>These concepts create the foundation for modern radio communication, We can modulate data signals to different bandwidths and receive them, provided we know where to tune to. And these bandwidths can either be continuous chunks of spectrum (AM), or interleaved (FM). The next step is to think in terms of time, which is to say that we can have receivers negotiate not only which ranges in frequency they care about, but which time frames they want to listen before waiting for their next time slot.<p>For those interested in the theory, the fundamental problem is that we can design antennas that can transmit or receive at some fixed maximum bandwidth, bounded by physics. The engineering problem is to find out how to share that bandwidth to maximize the number of receivers and&#x2F;or senders by sharing the same bandwidth. Amplitude modulation is excellent, but it divides the bandwidth up into a fixed number of channels of maximum individual bandwidth. FM is a bit more efficient in how it can allow many broadcasters to even more receivers choose which channels they receive. But for modern communications, where we need high bandwidth for distinct transmitter&#x2F;receiver connections, we need protocols to figure out how to share the bandwidth over the air and the two tricks are to divide that bandwidth by frequency (like AM and FM) or time (sharing the same frequency channels, but only picking the frames that we care about), or both.</div><br/><div id="39824356" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39824356" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duped</span><span>|</span><a href="#39824270">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39824356">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39824356">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And for those even <i>deeper</i> into the theory, one question you might ask is, if we can divide spectrum and time to get some bandwidth B per channel, how many bits can we send&#x2F;receive over a distinct channel?<p>The answer is C = Blog2(1 + S&#x2F;N) where B is the bandwidth and S&#x2F;N is the signal to noise ratio determined by the environment (how much noise is present relative to the signal being transmitted). The crazy thing is this was proven in the 1940s and everyone interested should go read <i>The Mathematical Theory of Communication</i> by Claude Shannon. This is referred to as the Shannon-Hartley theorem, and it determines the channel capacity (C, in bits&#x2F;second) of any communication channel in the presence of noise.<p>The math concepts might seem heady, but it&#x27;s actually fairly approachable and available online. It&#x27;s fascinating that the fundamentals were proven out in one work nearly 80 years ago by a handful of people, and the math is not that bad.<p>The thing that makes this nuts is that if an engineer picks some target bitrate for a device, say a cellphone watching video, they can work backwards to determine the channel capacity they need, do some experiments to figure out noise, and then determine what the target their modem protocol needs to reach to be suitable.

Absolutely none of it.<p>All that he&#x2F;she needs to know are very basic principles such as how antennas receive and radiate signals, how radio signals are amplified and detected, and later on how signals are mixed, multiplied and hetrodyned, and how radio transmitters and receivers work—even the principles behind how the common superhetrodyne receiver works is pretty standard knowledge for a radio hobbyist.<p>Back when I was learning about radio I doubt very much if an article would have been written in the tone of this story, especially so one that implied that to understand the subject could be difficult even at a hobby level. Why, you may ask? Well back then, if anyone had a hobby interest in electricity and electronics then essentially the only outlet for their interest was radio and perhaps television, as the other branches of electronics would not have been as readily accessible to hobbyists.<p>Nowadays, that&#x27;s changed, there&#x27;s much more to keep a hobbyist&#x27;s interests such as programming, computers, computer games, and other electronics not based on radio technology—digital electronics for instance, so knowledge about radio tech and radiocommunications theory have become much less commonplace having been diluted amongst all these competing interests. Obviously, the knowledge is still out there  but it&#x27;s more widely dissipated and not as easily accessible in the practical sense, especially so for hobbyists of a young age.<p>When radio was essentially all that there was around there were many more elementary books on radio available for younger readers and these increased in complexity as the hobbyist gained practical experience. For instance, when I first became interested in radio my first introduction to the subject—like most others—was building crystal set radios, and from there we advanced to incorporating tubes and transistors into our more advanced designs. For beginners, hands-on practical books such as how to build crystal sets which included many different designs were commonly available.<p>(Back then, a well known author of books on crystal sets and basic radio was Bernard B. Babani, an unforgettable name if ever there was one. His books are still available but you&#x27;d never know to look for them unless told about them.)<p>Today, many have never heard of crystal sets let alone their &#x27;cats&#x27; whisker&#x27; detectors, so when they become interested in the subject they&#x27;re thrown in at the deep end. And not having the basics already under their belts, the more advanced radio theory comes as a bit of a shock.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39827088" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39827088" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hoseja</span><span>|</span><a href="#39828574">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824603">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39827088">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39827088">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Another trick, which I haven&#x27;t really appreciated for a long time, is that it&#x27;s VERY dark in the radio frequencies. Black bodies radiate barely any energy there. It&#x27;s quiet so if you shout even moderately loudly you can be heard halfway across the globe.

Each section (a group of musicians playing the same instrument and part) has a leader, who usually plays the solo part (hence the title &quot;solo violin&quot; or &quot;first chair&quot;). The leader of the first violin section is the &quot;concertmaster,&quot; typically seated next to the conductor and responsible for leading the entire string section. In orchestras without a conductor, the concertmaster often assumes that role.<p>Each string player follows their section leader, who, in turn, follows the concertmaster, who follows the conductor. This is why they are seated at the front.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41644491" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41644491" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quartesixte</span><span>|</span><a href="#41644120">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644984">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41644491">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41644491">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s pretty difficult to play any classical instrument at the level required for elite philharmonic&#x2F;symphony orchestras. It&#x27;s why musicians all have to min-max on that instrument from an early age and go through many years of coaching and practice.<p>Playing the violin at an elite level seems to require a much earlier starting point, so I think that signals a higher level of difficulty. The range of possible sounds while being an incredibly unforgiving instrument in terms of sound quality add to this.<p>But I believe its stardom comes from its versatility and timbre.<p>Versatility: It can play any key naturally. Its relatively small size allows for fast passages to be played relatively easily. It can play two notes at a time, and even three or four in quick succession to simulate a chord. It is expressive in a way a tuba isn&#x27;t.<p>Timbre&#x2F;Expression: The Western classical tradition valued the Soprano voice as the &quot;main&quot; voice for melodies. The violin was more or less designed to emulate this voice and the characteristic agility, lightness, and clarity that defined any melody line given to it. So, composers would reach for the violin and make it the star of their compositions. As time went on, the tradition stuck, the virtuosity increased, and the ensembles grew ever larger and larger so the violin sections grew larger and larger.<p>For whatever reason, the Western Classical Tradition doesn&#x27;t quite like the sound of, say, a French Horn, dominating the melody line the same way violins do.<p>What leads me to believe this is all the musical traditions that started off with violins and then quickly ditched them once an instrument that provided the needed versatility and timbre the tradition demanded. Here, I&#x27;m mostly thinking of Jazz. Jazz violin was common during the early days of the genre, but quickly fell out of favor in comparison to the guitar, the trumpet, the saxophone, and the piano. For many of the same reasons the violin became the star of the Classical world.<p>It&#x27;s also why violins don&#x27;t really go with rock music. The guitar has the versatility required and the vocal expressiveness that suits the genre.</div><br/><div id="41644958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41644958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bondarchuk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41644120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644491">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41644958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41644958">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every modern symphonic instrument (except some percussion) can play any key naturally.</div><br/><div id="41645279" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41645279" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hunter2_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41644120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644166">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41645279">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41645279">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you play a chromatic scale on a valved brass instrument, played with no pitch adjustments via embouchure, you end up with a series of pitches that are of questionable temperament, since some intervals are achieved by jumping between registers which utilizes the harmonic series (integer multiples of frequency) while others are achieved through valves which don&#x27;t necessarily utilize integer ratios.

When music was often played without a conductor, it was the concertmaster who would lead the ensemble. They serve, musically, and sometimes organizationally, as the head or representative of the orchestra. In modern symphonic ensembles they come on stage separately to tune the ensemble. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s just tradition at this point.<p>As to why the focus and acclaim, I think it&#x27;s a combination of a few things. The first is a very, very high skill ceiling. I&#x27;ve heard that French horn can be harder to play, but violin is definitely considered to be among the hardest. Then there&#x27;s also repertoire. While there were early concerti for most instruments, it was even as early as Vivaldi where virtuosic violin rep started to appear. Then came Paganini and it was game over for the rest of the instruments. The sheer volume of pieces is why violin dominates over, say, cello. There may also be a physical size factor. You just can&#x27;t cover the range of a cello or bass as fast as a violin, though I&#x27;ve seen some insanely impressive low string players.</div><br/><div id="41644621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41644621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quartesixte</span><span>|</span><a href="#41644120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644234">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41644621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41644621">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People really underestimate the difficulty of playing a violin well.<p>The instrument is held in a quite unnatural position. Beginners must learn to become comfortable with the contortions necessary. You hold the violin up by squeezing it between your collarbones and your chin. Your hands&#x2F;arms are to NOT provide any support.<p>You have no frets on the fingerboard with mere centimeters or millimeters of gap between notes. You must be absolutely precise in your placement at all times at all tempos to make sure you are in tune. Due to the nature of most classical music, you are constantly shifting your hands up and down (forward and backward) on the fingerboard, thus eliminating the ability to &quot;anchor&quot; in one place. Only hours of dedicated practice can develop the muscle memory for such precise placement.<p>These placements must be done very quickly. A full 4&#x2F;4 measure of sixteenth notes at 120 bpm means you are placing a finger down approximately once every 0.125 seconds.<p>Now, while all of this is going on with your left hand, your right hand is manipulating the bow to draw the sound out of the violin.<p>You must, at all times, draw the bow across the string with the exact amount of pressure, speed, and angle to produce a clear sound. If you are playing a full 4&#x2F;4 measure of sixteenth notes at 120 bpm all separated (so a different stroke for each note), you are also moving your bow every 0.125 seconds. At the exact pressure, speed, angle and position on the violin. Be wrong in any of these and you will not produce the desired sound.<p>Often times, due to the rhythm of the piece, you will be moving your bow hand in a pattern very different from the left hand. So you are effectively doing two very different things at the same time. For example, if in that 4&#x2F;4 measure described above, every group of 3 notes were to be played by a single stroke before changing directions, you are now taking an action every 0.125 seconds on the left hand and an action every 0.375 seconds + one extra 0.125 second stroke at the end.<p>Now do this while reading sheet music, listening to your fellow ensemble mates to balance sound, watching a conductor to match tempo, express emotionally the intent of the piece.<p>So then, one must commit enough practice to make all the necessary motions to produce good sound an act of muscle memory. So that there is no conscious thought put into expressing anything the music needs. Thousands upon thousands of hours of drills so the cognitive focus can be on musical expression. To make it as effortless as speaking.<p>Only then can one sing with the violin. Child prodigies aside, it seems like it takes approximately 3 - 5 years of consistent training before one plays at a level considered &quot;adequate&quot;. Elite orchestral players require nearly over a decade of training just to be basic orchestra members. Virtuosos and stars report practicing every day for 4+ hours and will note that any extended break will result in rapid degradation of sound quality and motor skills.<p>It is a very difficult instrument with an incredibly high skill ceiling and a very long tradition of virtuosity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41644512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41644512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grujicd</span><span>|</span><a href="#41644120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644234">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644621">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644654">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41644512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41644512">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve seen this recently - it was a smaller orchestra without a conductor, and the lead violinist was moving upper body a lot in patterns resembling what a conductor does with a stick.</div><br/><div id="41644634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41644634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quartesixte</span><span>|</span><a href="#41644120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644512">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644654">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41644634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41644634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup!

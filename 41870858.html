Because you&#x27;ve got insurers and PBMs taking profit.<p>&gt; The ratio of those two numbers is the efficiency of the American insurance model.<p>The ratio of those two numbers is quite divorced from the efficiency of an insurance model.<p>On the one side, this would count wasteful spending on unnecessary tests or overpriced services as an efficiency <i>improvement</i> because proportionally more money is going to providers. On the other side, if insurers better at preventing fraud have lower premiums and therefore get more customers and make more money, that would count as &quot;inefficiency&quot; and the fraud <i>prevented</i> would <i>also</i> count as inefficiency (because that money went to &quot;providers&quot;), even if the net result is less fraud and lower premiums.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that the US system is efficient. It&#x27;s clearly quite broken. But its brokenness is because the government has been thoroughly captured by the industry -- which is the providers as much as the insurers -- and they oppose any measures that would improve actual efficiency because the inefficiency is their profit. Which is why the US system costs more than the systems in other countries regardless of whether the other countries use public or private systems.<p>An efficient regulatory system for a private insurance market would be something like, a schedule of service codes where each provider is required to publish a fee schedule representing the uniform fee paid by all institutional insurers, eliminating the overhead of &quot;negotiating prices&quot; (a major source of inefficiency) in favor of price transparency and allowing patients and insurers to choose a provider on the basis of price and distance, while still subjecting providers to competitive pressure because people would naturally favor providers with lower fees.

Many US healthcare payers are private non-profit corporations. That includes some (but not all) Blue Cross Blue Shield Association licensees. The BCBSA isn&#x27;t a payer itself and merely provides some shared services to their independent licensees. Outside of the Blues system there are other large non-profit payers such as Kaiser Permanente, HCSC, Geisinger, EmblemHealth, etc. This isn&#x27;t secret information, you can just go look it up instead of arguing.<p>Commercial health plans have conflicting financial incentives. Most of them no longer provide much insurance (in terms of bearing financial risk) but rather primarily act as administrators for self-insured employers. So while payers can potentially boost short-term profits by paying out higher claims, employers comparison shop between competing health plans every year. Your HR department would happily switch from Aetna to Cigna (or whatever) next year if their analytics forecast shows that would save a few dollars on expected claims.<p>Ambulance fees are a mess but those represent a tiny fraction of overall US healthcare spending. Some reform there would be a good idea but that wouldn&#x27;t do much to reduce costs.<p>Significant systemic cost reductions will require some mix of lower provider wages, care rationing, and reduced spending on new drug and device development. Countries with more socialized healthcare systems are more financially efficient in some ways but they also just do less stuff: less drug development, longer queues for advanced treatments, underpaid doctors (relative to market wages), care restrictions based on QALYs (or similar metrics). Complaints about payer profits, while perhaps somewhat legitimate in certain cases, are largely a distraction from more fundamental problems. That&#x27;s just basic math dictated by the cashflows. There are no simple solutions and we&#x27;re eventually going to have to make hard choices. No one wants to face this reality.</div><br/><div id="41882704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41882704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_DeadFred_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41880279">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41882552">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41881518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41882704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41882704">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Edited out frustration.<p>I wrote hospital medical software for 20 years passing on way better pay because I wanted to make a difference.

This is hard because we collectively can&#x27;t even agree on the desired outcomes or how to measure them. I mean at a high level most people think that everyone should have convenient, affordable access to high-quality care but once you get into specifics everything gets complicated and making trade-offs which disadvantage some voters is unpopular.

In fact from their introduction you can very much see the problem:<p><pre><code>  the fraction of people filing for bankruptcy who happen to have substantial medical expenses.
</code></pre>
Like...that is a weird factor to just try and wash away with sample selection.<p>The only factor they considered was the proportion of people who filed for bankruptcy by years before&#x2F;after hospitalization, which they found was about 4% of total bankruptcies - <i>for non-elderly adults</i>.<p><pre><code>  we estimate that hospitalizations cause only 4% of personal bankruptcies among nonelderly U.S. adults, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the previous estimates described above.
</code></pre>
Now let&#x27;s put that in perspective: one of the most common routine surgeries for a healthy person would be having your appendix out. That&#x27;s a hospitalization, you stay overnight. It&#x27;s also fairly cheap and immensely routine.<p>It is also notable that the study was focused on patients at a single Californian hospital -<p><pre><code>  we therefore selected a sample of people who were admitted to the hospital in California

  Our study was based on a random stratified sample of adults 25 to 64 years of age who, between 2003 and 2007, were admitted to the hospital (for a non–pregnancy-related stay) for the first time in at least 3 years
</code></pre>
In short, the way this study is being thrown around to assert how medical bankruptcy works is invalid. And I&#x27;m calling completely bullshit on this methodology. Even their conclusions more or less paint the picture:<p><pre><code>  We have found that hospitalizations cause: *increased out-of-pocket spending on medical care*, *increased medical debt*, and decreased employment and income

This seems to be done by scouring management accounting databases to figure out what the payers and providers consider to be reasonable reimbursement rates for accounting purposes, whether or not that is what they actually receive.<p>I get what they&#x27;re trying to do, but this probably explains some of the counterintuive results, because mostly people are probably thinking more along the lines of &quot;add up all premiums paid to insurers, out of pocket expenses paid directly by consumers to providers, and all government outlays classified as healthcare&quot; and that&#x27;s how much your country spends on healthcare.<p>That&#x27;s a reasonable comparison to make, but as the blog and the OECD report both point out, it does nothing to account for differences in quantity and quality of healthcare goods being paid for.

When we needed to refill her prescriptions, our short-term rental host said, &quot;Go to the ER.&quot;<p>Backstory: we&#x27;re well familiar with ERs in the U.S. Due to various conditions, we&#x27;ve been to at least a dozen ERs a total of perhaps twenty times. For anyone who doesn&#x27;t know, unless you are actively dying, visiting the ER in the U.S. is sloooow. The average time to see a doctor, in our experience, is about an hour.<p>So we replied: &quot;the ER? seriously?&quot;<p>He assured us it would be fine, so we walked ten minutes to the ER and signed in. We had barely turned in the history paperwork when they called us to go back. No preliminary check-in with the nurse -- straight to the doctor.<p>She said, &quot;Why did you come to the ER? We could have been busy and you would have had to wait.&quot;<p>We explained how our host had assured us this was the best way to go, and that the ER would take care of us.<p>The doctor nodded and said, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ll sign for the prescriptions, but just remember it might take more time the next time.&quot;<p>We went back to the front desk. Remember, we had no travel insurance, this was full freight. &quot;That will be twenty-eight euro.&quot; We happily paid, and walked out the door, prescriptions in hand, less than 30 minutes after we walked in.<p>Bonus: the cost to buy the prescriptions, again with no insurance, was <i>less</i> than the co-pay in the U.S. with employer-healthcare.<p>N=2: When my daughter was visiting me in Bangkok, she got a bit of a gastro issue. Same as in Portugal, we had no insurance for her. I took her to Bumrungrad, one of the best hospitals in Thailand. We were in and out in under an hour, including picking up the prescription, and the total cost was under $100.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to rebut the article, just throwing out some details.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41884374" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41884374" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">not2b</span><span>|</span><a href="#41884912">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41882444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41884374">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41884374">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I notice that the terms &quot;debt&quot; and &quot;bankruptcy&quot; (and their variants) appear nowhere in the article.</div><br/><div id="41884387" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41884387" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cryptonector</span><span>|</span><a href="#41884374">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41882444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41884387">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41884387">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So what?

What I didn’t see is something I’ve heard from doctors but can’t verify. It’s that insurance companies require them to do extra procedures or have extra employees they don’t think they need. Some who didn’t take insurance say it keeps their cost down.<p>One told me the insurance companies incentivize him to treat patients like an assembly line where cash only lets him spend one on one time with customers. He also might treat people for several things on the same bill which he claimed he’d have to itemize and charge separately for with insurance.<p>So, do people here have specific examples (esp links) to support or refute those anecdotes? If they were true, it would mean insurance rules were driving much of the cost. Looking at their causes, my first guess would be how they respond to losses from both real malpractice and greed-driven lawsuits. I can’t imagine that costs aren’t impacted by this with all the lawyer ads I see for suing insurance companies. ;)</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

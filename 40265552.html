I’ll still be polite and all but the second an alternative is there I’m gone.<p>Alternatively there are companies that are always pleasant to interact with. Avemco is an insurance company I use and any time I have a question for them they either have the answer or go find it immediately. When it’s time to renew they proactively check if I’m eligible for better rates. even if someone came in with a quote at a 30% premium discount I’d probably not hear them out because I just don’t expect such service elsewhere.<p>It’s sad that these nice experiences get optimized away, I honestly think people would be nicer to each other if it didn’t constantly feel like everyone was constantly racing to the bottom.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;randsinrepose.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;shields-down&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;randsinrepose.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;shields-down&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40266595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40266595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eviks</span><span>|</span><a href="#40267028">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40265696">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40266595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40266595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If small things mattered, you wouldn&#x27;t have so many of them neglected.<p>&quot;(And smiles they are free.&quot;<p>Forced service smiles aren&#x27;t free, but a result of continuous spend on training the service personnel</div><br/></div></div><div id="40265696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40265696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thesuperbigfrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#40266595">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40266111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40265696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40265696">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good customer experience matters.  People remember how they were treated and they will be more loyal to a company that goes the extra mile to give them what they need.<p>Years ago when I worked at Amazon, leaders made customer experience a priority and empowered us to do what was needed to ensure a good customer experience even if would cost the company more.  I am not sure if things are the same there now, but it taught me a lot about how a company&#x27;s relationship with its customers matters for the company&#x27;s long-term growth and customer loyalty.<p>The enshittification trends we see today are the opposite.  Companies are all to happy to make quick profits by choosing to put what is best for the company ahead of the customer experience.  Customer data is sold and shared.  Ads are cramed into every possible space.  Customers are opted in to onerous legal agreements and forced arbitration.  Dark patterns abound.<p>Customers notice.  Customers remember.  And when the circumstances are right they will drop such companies and watch them burn with pleasure.  The golden rule still holds and no company is &quot;too big to fail&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40266185" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40266185" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wrs</span><span>|</span><a href="#40265696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40266056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40266185">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40266185">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I just had an Amazon package stolen from my porch with $500 of items in it that I needed quickly.

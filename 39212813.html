Stories are made-up, vague, hand-waving. metaphorical and allegorical.
They occupy a different, parallel communicative realm to science,
maths and equations. But they are no less true, particularly with
regard to their utility if you want to communicate important ideas to
lots of people.<p>Certainly, mysticism is not an analytical or investigative tool. But
it is a powerful communicative, and - since you raise Wittgenstein - a
powerful symbolic tool for word-concepts that &quot;stand in for&quot;
formalisms.<p>To be honest I think that the way the younger generations relate to
smartphones, the Internet and AI is very much mysticism. The words
have changed, but I don&#x27;t see concepts like &quot;The Cloud&quot; having any
more substance than &quot;Ectoplasm&quot; and &quot;ethereal spirits&quot;.<p>Again, that new generation mysticism isn&#x27;t a bad thing, it&#x27;s just a

things that do not exist yet retain utility as concepts; money,
democracy, wellness. And there are &quot;real&quot; things that only muddy the
waters.<p>Yes, one can point to a specific computer and say that it is part of
The Cloud, just as you can point to a neuron or person and say that

about societies, brains or clouds? I&#x27;m obviously channelling an inner
Douglas Hofstadter here.<p>The Cloud is something mystical not because it&#x27;s an abstraction but
because people don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s more of an abdication than an

While psilocybin was shown to be marginally more effective than escitalopram, the difference was not statistically significant. A subsequent Bayesian reanalysis did show a statistically significant advantage to psilocybin, but this difference was not clinically significant. Other RCTs investigating classical psychedelics have shown similar results.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of excitement about psychedelics, a lot of hype, a lot of people who dearly <i>want</i> them to be a breakthrough (and god knows, we need a breakthrough), but the data we have just doesn&#x27;t justify that excitement. This article presents a compelling narrative explaining why classical psychedelics might be a radically effective psychiatric treatment, but that amounts to nothing if psychedelics are not in fact radically effective; although it is still far too early to make any firm conclusions, the evidence we do have suggests that psychedelics are, at best, only a modest improvement over the current state-of-the-art.<p>This does not preclude the possibility that psychedelics could be the best available treatment for a subset of patients, nor does it invalidate the personal experiences of people who believe that they have experienced dramatic benefits from psychedelic therapy, but it is grounds for considerable caution.

cave-dwelling people.<p>There&#x27;s a reason 99 percent of us take that blue pill every day.  We
like to have friends, go to dinner parties, wear acceptable clothes
and say acceptable things.<p>Trauma sets you apart. That&#x27;s the best way I can put it.<p>PTG is a 20 or 30 year process of adapting to so-called &quot;super
powers&quot;.<p>A movie they never made is &quot;What ever happened to Will Hunting?&quot;
After Matt Damon hugged Robin Williams and drove off into the
sunset...  what came next? Drug abuse, alcoholism? A 20 year gambling
spree in Las Vegas? Or just endless fun with Minnie Driver?<p>I&#x27;m not against recreational psychedelics, indeed I take the Bill
Hicks view that they should be mandatory for some :) But to use them
as a &quot;pivotal&quot; therapeutic shortcut to &quot;wellness&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to add
up in my view. You&#x27;ll still have to do &quot;the work&quot;, sooner or later.</div><br/><div id="39213578" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39213578" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#39212975">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39213253">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39213043">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39213578">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39213578">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">but it&#x27;s a ladder where the first rung is too high up to reach without the help. you still gotta climb the ladder and do the work, but without the help, you can&#x27;t even try to climb the ladder in the first place.</div><br/><div id="39213692" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39213692" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nonrandomstring</span><span>|</span><a href="#39212975">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39213578">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39213043">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39213692">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39213692">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You make a good point.

As the article correctly deduces (IMO), it was related to their quasi-monopoly.  It was a partial and insecure monopoly; they did need to innovate or they would eventually be eaten.  Telecoms was their business, in the very broadest sense.  New ways of drawing wire more efficiently would benefit their bottom line.  New forms of amplifier technology would almost certainly benefit them ten or twenty years down the line.  Same with a new kind of treatment to make telephone poles last longer.  So basic metallurgy, forestry, and cutting-edge semiconductor physics were all within the remit.

And you need the interaction between people doing practical work and feeling limitations and the playhouse trying stuff out.<p>Bell Labs worked because AT&amp;T had huge field operations, a huge automation problem (telephone switching and billing), and a huge manufacturing arm for telco equipment and customer equipment, and a reputation for solving problems related to communication. Small innovations easily contributed to the bottom line, and large innovations enabled massive expansion of communication. Also, there&#x27;s a huge benefit from research being connected to scale --- Bell labs innovations were likely to be applied in AT&amp;Ts businesses quickly which informs future innovation; if you&#x27;re an unconnected playhouse of ideas, it&#x27;s hard to know if your innovations can be applied.<p>For better or worse, things are less integrated now. Telcos still have large field operations, but they don&#x27;t usually manufacture the equipment. Automation of telephone switching is so complete, I don&#x27;t know if there are any operators anymore. Billing for usage is very limited.<p>You see some companies developing the processors in equipment they use and sell, which is more integrated than when it was all Intel&#x2F;AMD&#x2F;Qualcomm.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41002002" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41002002" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdorazio</span><span>|</span><a href="#40999108">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41001074">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41001541">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41001334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41002002">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41002002">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As much as I dislike Elon these days, this is basically how all his recent companies have been setup.

Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product. Bell Labs instead shipped the system for the cost of media and shipping.<p>...<p>In 1983, the U.S. Department of Justice settled its second antitrust case against AT&amp;T, causing the breakup of the Bell System. This relieved AT&amp;T of the 1956 consent decree that had prevented the company from commercializing Unix. AT&amp;T promptly introduced Unix System V into the market. The newly created competition nearly destroyed the long-term viability of Unix, because it stifled the free exchanging of source code and led to fragmentation and incompatibility. The GNU Project was founded in the same year by Richard Stallman.&quot;</div><br/><div id="41001060" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41001060" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghaff</span><span>|</span><a href="#40999108">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41000845">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41001916">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41001060">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41001060">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m well aware of the history of Unix.

In part:<p><i>The consent decree contained two main remedies. The Bell System was obligated
to license all its existing patents royalty-free, and it was barred from entering any
industry other than telecommunications. As a consequence, 7,820 patents, or 1.3 per-
cent of all unexpired US patents, in a wide range of fields became freely available in
1956.&quot;<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeaweb.org&#x2F;articles?id=10.1257&#x2F;pol.20190086" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeaweb.org&#x2F;articles?id=10.1257&#x2F;pol.20190086</a>&gt;<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.aeaweb.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfplus&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;pol.20190086" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.aeaweb.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfplus&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;pol.20190086</a>&gt; (PDF)<p>My understanding is that the decree also </i>specifically* prohibited AT&amp;T from engaging in <i>either</i> computer hardware or software markets.  Consequence is that when AT&amp;T developed operating systems, compilers, and associated software for the UNIX System beginning in 1969, it literally had no option <i>but</i> to give the fruits away gratis, or hold them internally.<p>That restriction was lifted after the 1984 anti-trust settlement, though it took AT&amp;T a few years to start acting on that.  Once it did the result was the &quot;Unix Wars&quot; of the late 1980s &#x2F; early 1990s, which amongst other effects put a strong damper on commercial viability of BSD-based Unix systems, whilst an alternative coded-from-scratch run-alike system originating out of Finland faced no such headwinds.  That system was Linux.<p>(This history is ... referenced in numerous sources, though I&#x27;m finding it difficult to turn up specifics.  The 1956 DoJ settlement doesn&#x27;t seem to be online at all, and this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve searched for it.  Wikipedia discusses various elements of the AT&amp;T antitrust actions, dating to 1913, but is fairly poorly sourced, see: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_System#Kingsbury_Commitment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bell_System#Kingsbury_Commitme...</a>&gt;.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that the Unix &#x2F; Linux history is covered in various sources, possibly some of ESR&#x27;s writings or elsewhere.  I&#x27;m pretty confident of my facts here, but would prefer being able to source my statements more concretely.)</div><br/><div id="41002614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41002614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vinnyvichy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40999786">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41002558">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41000538">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41002614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41002614">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is all true of AT&amp;T but remember Bell Labs was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T, and by all accounts from the ground, the Bell Labs management were able to promote a culture shielded from the politics of AT&amp;T.<p>(Compare with GoogleX, similar intentions, maybe better starting conditions)<p>IP issues-- an interesting case study would be how the BL managers  handled Shockley.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41000538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41000538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1992spacemovie</span><span>|</span><a href="#40999786">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41002558">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41003605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41000538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41000538">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ironically wholesome lawyer story.

When I was 6 or 7 I read a book in the school library in which the villains were the &quot;bone people&quot; and the heroes were space explorers. The bone people could read minds, so they could tell everything the heroes were planning and thwart them.<p>Eventually the heroes learn to keep their true thoughts in the back of their minds, where the bone people can&#x27;t access them, and with this technique they eventually defeat the bone people. It was the best book I&#x27;d ever read (up till then!) and I remember practicing keeping my thoughts in the back of my mind.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find this book again. Anybody have ideas?<p>Edit: it occurred to me that I should try an LLM, so I pasted the above text into O1 and, in a combination of anticlimactic and thrilling, it gave the answer straightaway. The book is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Bone-People-Space-Science-Fiction&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0817525033" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Bone-People-Space-Science-Fiction&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a> and the title is, er, &quot;Bone People&quot;.

The only challenge I remember was that she sets up 3 cauldrons: One had boiling oil. One had milk.

The cold water cauldron even freezes over.<p>The boy breaks out of the last cauldron and has been transformed into a strapping young man.<p>The king, seeing proof that it works, decides to jump into the cauldrons. However, when he hops out, he&#x27;s still an old man.<p>The woman announces that the magic only works once, and she and the stable boy walk away together, arm-in-arm.<p>...<p>I&#x27;ve searched for it online a fair bit but I&#x27;ve never found it.<p>Some details from my memory:<p><pre><code>  * The cartoon was very short (less than 30 minutes. probably closer to 10 or 15) 
  * It had no dialog, only sound effects and music.
  * A woman&#x27;s voice narrated it. I can still hear her.
  * Now that I&#x27;m grown, I see it having a Slavic or Russian aesthetic.
  * The woman had black hair and a long white dress.
  * The king was very short with a big white beard.
  * The boy, when he turns into a man, has pointy boots and shoulder pads. :)
  * Probably made between 1975 and 1985
  * Part of an anthology (many cartoons on one VHS tape... ours had been run so much that it started to skew and stretch the image)

A little like The Story Teller [1], but much earlier.<p>Sadly, I can&#x27;t recall any more about it than that, but maybe it&#x27;ll help that you&#x27;re not alone. And of course this could be nothing at all related to what you&#x27;re after.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belle_and_Sebastian_(1965_TV_series)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Belle_and_Sebastian_(1965_TV_s...</a>

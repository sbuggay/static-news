To be interesting enough to be featured in mainstream media, it needs to be surprising or unexpected in some way. However, that means that the Bayesian prior probability is low, and thus, especially since p = 0.05 is used for publication regardless of how unexpected the result is, the conditional probability is lower compared to a study that was not featured in media (because it was not a surprising result - meaning that the prior probability was higher).</div><br/><div id="36191662" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36191662" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rcme</span><span>|</span><a href="#36191027">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36193066">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36191662">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36191662">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In this case, I think the idea was chosen for media publication not because it was surprising but because it appeals to our senses. &quot;We&quot; (the collective &#x27;we&#x27;) like the idea that nature is a network of things. &quot;We&quot; also like the idea that mushrooms are some type of central nervous system for nature.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36193066" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36193066" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mbgerring</span><span>|</span><a href="#36191027">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36190819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36193066">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36193066">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel like the author of this article should have brought the economics of both journalism and scientific research into the equation here.<p>Every academic scientist I know says that grant funding favors sensationalized, spectacular sounding results, and journalists know that carefully reported, nuanced stories don’t get clicks or move ad inventory.

That study found evidence of net carbon transfer between seedlings of two different species, and it posited that most of the carbon was transported through CMNs, while downplaying other possible explanations. This is what’s known as “confirmation bias,” and it is an easy trap to fall into. As hard as it is to admit, it was only due to our skepticism of the recent extraordinary claims about the wood-wide web that we looked back and saw the bias in our own work.<p>Over decades, these and other distortions have propagated in the academic literature on CMNs, steering the scientific discourse further and further away from reality, similar to a game of “telephone.” In our review, we found that the results of older, influential field studies of CMNs have been increasingly misrepresented by the newer papers that cite them. Among peer reviewed papers published in 2022, fewer than half the statements made about the original field studies could be considered accurate. A 2009 study that used genetic techniques to map the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi, for instance, is now frequently cited as evidence that trees transfer nutrients to one another through CMNs — even though that study did not actually investigate nutrient transfer. In addition, alternative hypotheses provided by the original authors were typically not mentioned in the newer studies.<p>As these biases have spilled over into the media, the narrative has caught fire. And no wonder: If scientists themselves could be seduced by potentially sensational findings, it is not surprising that the media could too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36191889" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36191889" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jnsaff2</span><span>|</span><a href="#36192267">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36190699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36191889">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36191889">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The book that sprang into mind is The Overstory by Richard Powers [0]<p>Fantastic book but all the CMN communication and nutrient sharing seemed a bit too fantastical there too.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Overstory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Overstory</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36190699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36190699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">micromacrofoot</span><span>|</span><a href="#36191889">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36190221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36190699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36190699">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">this kind of thing propagates through media too, star trek and the last of us come to mind as recent shows with “mycelium networks” and they of course don’t need to be accurate but it doesn’t</div><br/></div></div><div id="36191529" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36191529" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rkagerer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36190221">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36191529">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36191529">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Where the World-Wide Web Went Wrong: JavaScript<p>(Couldn&#x27;t help myself)</div><br/><div id="36193109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36193109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">namaria</span><span>|</span><a href="#36191529">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36193109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36193109">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whatever toolset there is will eventually be bent to the shape of the task at hand.

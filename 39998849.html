it may not be the absolute truth, but in my personal anecdotal experience, there is quite some truth to it.
  I have had a lot of fun playing around with image generation and chat gpt.<p>But have also had the non-surprising &quot;Hedonistic Fatigue&quot;
that comes with excess access to something originally valued.
  I have now been able to generate 4 and 5 digit numbers
of pictures of awesome colourful steam locomotives and epic dungeon vistas,
but now find myself fatigued by &quot;what on earth am I going to use 5000 dungeon pictures for?&quot;,
coupled with the dread of being forced to CHOOSE from 5000 options.
And I learn the known principle,
that when you can choose from 4 options, you are happy you
picked the best of 4,
but when you can pick from 5000 options,
you are left feeling inadequate with &quot;I almost certainly was
not able to pick the best of those 5000 options,
and trying to do so would exhaust me&quot;.
  So suddenly, picking something from your menu of options,
feels dreadful and fatiguing..
(I get the same feeling sometimes, when trying to pick a movie to watch 
out of 16.000 options).<p>So yeah, no doubt the AI sketch&#x2F;refinement tool will be merged into our
creative process, 
but for the time being, I feel a second generation of alienation-estrangement

Because the point of art was to communicate or convey something with other people and the AI has no idea because its not human.<p>A few word or a sequence of sound can be enough to transfer great deal of feeling and meaning  because we run about the same software and as a result we can generate the same output with a little bit of input. This is all done by looking inside and externalise it, that is someone feels something and makes a song from it and that song can be used to regenerate the feelings in other people.<p>The current AI tech doesn&#x27;t have a way to do that because doesn&#x27;t have a way to look inside. At best, it can imitate things within some context but the output doesn&#x27;t have any meaning at all. The most successful AI contet was maybe the the Pope wearing Balenciaga but that wasn&#x27;t because the AI thought it mean something but because someone looked inside and thought this can be interesting.<p>So no, AI isn&#x27;t taking over the creative process. AI is taking over the mechanical part of it only, that is the part where the artist traditionally had to master a method of production or an instrument.<p>The AI evangelists keep pushing short videos or drawings that look &quot;professional&quot; and claiming that Hollywood is done, artists are screwed etc but those are worthless outside of the context that AI made it.

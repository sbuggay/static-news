How might you have reacted to the theft of a replaceable boat when capturing the thieves was so time-consuming and dangerous?<p>This might sound a bit self-helpy but I&#x27;ve found one of the best indicators of a great people is their passion for <i>caring</i> about things most other people wouldn&#x27;t bother to put effort into and then turning that basic caring into something bigger and interesting. Like how this turn into one of his many legendary life stories.<p>Most of us have a capacity for a few things to care about but some people have an ability&#x2F;energy to cast that broadly.

That&#x27;s your stuff, and it makes total sense to want <i>it</i>, not a replacement, and to want to punish the thief in the process. You&#x27;re fully within your moral rights (imo) to try to take it back.<p>.. I mean, within reason. Don&#x27;t do anything stupid.<p>Anyway this very human urge is why e.g. rampant property theft in certain US cities is so frustrating.

The money I spent to buy them, and the money I will spend to replace them, did not come from nowhere, that represents time wasted out of my life, that I will never get back. In a sense someone stealing something from you is not just about the material value of what was stolen but the transfer of all the hours of your life you wasted to afford it to someone who didn&#x27;t. In an abstract sense it is an indirect assault on your lifespan.

There are not many countries where your average everyman can just walk into a store to buy a weapon that would actually be reasonable to use in a self defense scenario without harming yourself and then use them to legally protect themselves, their families, their properties. And those are rights sadly that many people in the US campaign against even knowing that once they are gone they are not likely to get them back. In other countries, people do not bring up such topics because they know the reality of having such rights in the future are more or less an impossibility.</div><br/><div id="38330511" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38330511" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zwirbl</span><span>|</span><a href="#38328949">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38330192">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38329639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38330511">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38330511">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or people in other countries are actually glad that the risk of being shot are minimal while still being safe</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38329639" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38329639" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wahnfrieden</span><span>|</span><a href="#38328949">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38329292">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38329354">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38329743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38329639">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38329639">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The largest category of property theft in the US is wage theft.

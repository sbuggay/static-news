At some level, it is almost a free speech issue. If I can&#x27;t refer to what you are saying, without owing you something, you have power over not just my speech, but a power to limit how your work is subjected to criticism and debate. It&#x27;s effectively an extension of copyright law to expand copyright holder&#x27;s rights.<p>Obviously all this is hyperbolic based the actual text of the law. The law doesn&#x27;t directly apply any sort of link tax, and it is shamelessly targeted only at Google and Facebook (to the point that they wrote Facebook in there by name, which is kind of stupid if you ask me). But if you drill into the reasoning it hits at the foundational level on this basic logic, and it&#x27;s pretty concerning if we assume then that this <i>will</i> be significantly extrapolated and expanded - as has been the history with all other aspects of copyright in the past.<p>Honestly I would rather that governments come clean and just admit that the problem they are trying to solve is actually a &quot;social good&quot; outcome, and therefore directly tax the platforms and then redistribute the revenue to a fund created by government for news journalism themselves. Trying to artificially construct that through introduction of significant new precedents in copyright law engenders huge risks of unintended consequences and potential future extrapolation and abuse of this principle.</div><br/><div id="40018089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40018089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notatoad</span><span>|</span><a href="#40017999">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40021283">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40018089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40018089">[50 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I have sympathy for news publishers<p>i have very little sympathy for news publishers.

Even $1&#x2F;year is too high.<p>Alternatives to increasing advertisements have been tried and found to work. However, these approaches may not be feasible for all publications—especially local news outlets that may not have as many resources. These approaches are to:<p>i) Start selling other services besides news. The New York Times—one of the most currently financially successful newspapers—has found a lot of success in its Games section. This was famously seen in their acquisition of Wordle, though this has already been popular with their Crosswords section. The company has also found success with its Recipes section. (This is not the only reason behind their financial success, but it&#x27;s a significant part of their strategy.)<p>ii) Focus on financial news, which lets the publication frame their reports as having a financial value that arguably exceeds the subscription price. The Financial Times is also a highly profitable newspaper today, with one of the highest-priced subscription prices that can be about $500 USD a year for a standard subscription (depending on one&#x27;s region). The Wall Street Journal similarly charges a high subscription price. Both are seen as important resources for well-funded companies to buy group subscriptions for. (Once more, this isn&#x27;t the only reason for their success, but it&#x27;s a major factor.)<p>iii) Focus on a specialized, niche area of reporting that other publications can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t cover—ideally appealing to institutions or large audiences willing to spend money. For example, several publications in Canada focus on providing detailed reports on federal politics (such as The Hill Times and iPolitics), which is useful information for their readership that fills a gap by less-frequent reports from the country&#x27;s main newspapers—this lets them charge high subscription prices. The Athletic also used to be financially successful by standing out with its sports-only reporting, which led to its acquisition by The New York Times. These specialized publications can charge more, because certain audiences find these reports financially valuable.<p>---<p>However, a major drawback to thinking about news through the lens of financial value is that many important news stories don&#x27;t have financial value. While an outlet can attempt to use one of these approaches to subsidize the rest of their stories, it&#x27;s also costly. It&#x27;s usually not feasible for many local newspapers to fund the software development of a Games section (especially as this would need to compete with all the other online alternatives for one&#x27;s attention).<p>It&#x27;s also pricey to offer competitive enough salaries to create a newsroom to compete with The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg. However, it&#x27;s not impossible—there have been a few alternative publications that have found success by focusing on a niche, such as business news in a country outside of the US, or focusing on a sector such as biotech for the publication STAT.<p>It&#x27;s a tough problem to try and fund local news. There is civic value for one&#x27;s community to have a platform for providing a check against corruption by various institutions—yet in practice, oftentimes not enough for most local residents purchase subscriptions. Alternatives to support local news can include funding (such as through taxes), but that makes the outlet reliant on government funding, which is subject to change (and the perception, real or not, that the outlet is less independent from the government).<p>Increasing advertisements seems like a short-term solution for local news outlets trying to stay afloat, but it&#x27;s hard for me to see this as a long-term solution for sufficient funding.</div><br/><div id="40020111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40020111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">massysett</span><span>|</span><a href="#40017999">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40019884">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40018848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40020111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40020111">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s a tough problem to try and fund local news.

Only people who <i>really</i> want to read the original reporting in full will pay to subscribe to the LA Times.<p>There used to be regional&#x2F;temporal barriers in place before the Web was popular; newspapers had geographically limited distribution and it took time to print a new edition. One newspaper &quot;scooping&quot; another by one day was all it took to get people to buy the one-day-earlier publication. Also, 20th century newspapers collected significant revenue from classified advertising, people buying the paper just to get a weather forecast, and other kinds of information distribution that really didn&#x27;t have anything to do with investigative news. The Web unbundled all that (weather.gov, Craigslist, etc.) and the only remaining strength of newspapers was producing original reporting.

(I’m not sure what the Danish branche is in English), but rather that there are just so many things competing for people’s attention in general. With SoMe being actively designed to be addictive through various algorithms I think it’s only natural that people spend more of their time on Instagram, TikTok, Reddit or even HackerNews. I think that is time that a lot of people would’ve otherwise spend on news.<p>Add to this the introduction of terrible news media. The spam and click bait media, where you get the articles for free but the articles you get are basically worse than what you’d find anywhere else because they are most there to generate revenue from advertising. Stuff that gives “traditional” news media a very bad image. Further add the media platforms which are now straight up political propaganda, which some always where, but now they are owned by very few people and push very divisive agendas which is a little different from the past where they were more inline with each other and the “general” aristocracy rather than a few billionaires&#x2F;oligarchs and you gain the general media perception even more. Both are rightfully so.<p>In a sense you get what you pay for though. If you’re not paying you’re not getting quality news. You can see this in Danish news very clearly, where only a handful of news papers still do actual critical journalism and the rest mainly do opinions or click-bait articles on current events that you might as well read on Facebook. Not because Facebook does anything particularly in that department but because the contractors who sell stories and pictures to the “free” news media typically also post their content elsewhere for increased revenue on their part.<p>As far as going to the “biggest” most “cultural” news media I totally agree with you. In my country people read Weekend Avisen, and then add one of the more politically inclined subscription papers based on their views. But basically it boils down to thee papers, one that is slightly more conservative (which in Scandinavian&#x2F;American optics would make it almost socialist), one that is left-leaning (again, very socialist in American optics) and one that is based on Christianity (but extremely moderate, as in pro abortion and gay marriage).<p>Aside from that there are two “localised” papers which either focus heavily on Copenhagen or the part of our country which is called Jylland.<p>Almost none of these papers would be alive without government subsidies. Because the only two papers which actually makes money are Weekendavisen (our NYT) and the Christian paper which doesn’t actually make money but is subsidised by various Christian groups.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40017920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40017920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">internetter</span><span>|</span><a href="#40015439">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40017605">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40021169">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40018239">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40017920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40017920">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Completely agree with all this, though <i>my</i> take away is that there&#x27;s a big vicious cycle of adblockers and paywalls where they keep getting worse.

Google does not support all news organizations equally, and this seems designed to gain some leverage over organizations that do get a lot from Google. Their Google News Initiative is on its surface just a training platform for publishers to learn how to use Google’s tools but they’ve done quite a bit more for some publishers. This feels like an attempt to gain the vocal support of publishers who have been blessed by Google’s beneficence, many of which are earnest non-profit organizations who might take the bait about big bad hedge funds. I don’t know how they select who to help and who to ignore and our attempts to engage with them on behalf of publishers have had mixed results.<p>But publishers’ collective frustration with Google is quite high. Given the implications that “it would be a shame if something happened to your nice journalism website” coupled with the appeal against the big bad hedge funds and ghost papers, it’s sort of a clever position but I’m not sure it will work.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40015756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40015756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#40015572">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40016074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40015756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40015756">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Google post is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.google&#x2F;products&#x2F;news&#x2F;california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.google&#x2F;products&#x2F;news&#x2F;california-journalism-pres...</a> (via <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40015355">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40015355</a>, but I merged that thread hither since this article has more background).<p>Also:<p><i>California Assembly votes to pass the Journalism Preservation Act</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36165322">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36165322</a> - June 2023 (99 comments)<p><i>Facebook and Instagram owner Meta threatens to cut off news in California</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36148877">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36148877</a> - June 2023 (27 comments)<p><i>Can the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act preserve local journalism?</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27943976">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27943976</a> - July 2021 (1 comment)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40016074" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40016074" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paxys</span><span>|</span><a href="#40015756">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40015904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40016074">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40016074">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder if these media conglomerates think the same laws should apply to them.

I think <i>that</i> issue needs to be addressed independent of media outlets specifically. For example with AI, big tech companies are in a position to put themselves first in front of customers and prevent any smaller players from competing for users and market share. Now Apple and Microsoft are forcing their AI agents onto phones and computers, and potentially violating privacy of users and using all their data for training or other purposes. We’ve seen such a long history of anti competitive practices from these companies, and rather than dealing with performative court cases that drag out for years, we need to deal with the fact that they’re too big. They need to be split up. Or maybe just get taxed more compared to everyone else.</div><br/><div id="40016394" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40016394" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kemayo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40016225">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40016348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40016394">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40016394">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can&#x27;t speak for what Google plans to do in the future, but <i>currently</i> news results in search can either be a &quot;top stories&quot; block at the top of the results, or regular search results.

We see the problem all over media: If you are relying on google to give you traffic, your content better be really cheap and SEO&#x27;d to death, or be a funnel where most content is hidden, trying to drive people into subscriptions. Agglomeration in the traffic driving and ad spaces leads to them taking most of the profit unless there&#x27;s agglomeration on the other end. Just like in American healthcare, more people using the same insurance companies that try to drag reimbursement rates down is met by hospital networks gobbling up practices and pharmacies, as to get market power that the insurer cannot ignore. So we&#x27;ll see situations where, say, Google and the NYT have to decide whether the search traffic is worth it, and what&#x27;s the right price for letting the latest AI ingest the entire contents of the Times.<p>It&#x27;s not about moral good or bad, but about how incentive structures leave us with few viable economic models.

After school they can be anywhere as they&#x27;ll go to a friend&#x27;s house or just hang out somewhere for a while on the way home. Neither of my kids has a device that I can track, only one of them as a dumb Nokia phone, which end up being left at home most of the time.<p>If I want to know where they are to reduce worry then either I have to call them, which feels intrusive to what they&#x27;re doing; or it relies on their friend&#x27;s parent letting me know where they are. I know people who worry a lot more than us, so a non-intrusive location finding of a 10 year old would reduce parental worry without making the child feel like they were being hassled. Currently these parents are giving their young kids smart phones, often without any parental controls, and I think that&#x27;s a lot worse than a watch option. My main worry with these watches is about how good the security &amp; controls are on them to prevent unauthorized messages or calls.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40520970" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40520970" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">broeng</span><span>|</span><a href="#40517658">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40521180">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40520970">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40520970">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a toddler, and that has changed my view on it a bit, from the same starting point you are expressing.<p>With the social pressure going on, I expect she&#x27;ll get a smartphone earlier that I&#x27;d honestly prefer (not that we are there any time soon), and quite a bit before she&#x27;s a teenager.<p>So I honestly expect we&#x27;ll be location sharing for a while, but I don&#x27;t expect it to continue into the teenage years.

I was at Disneyland with my seven-year-old nephew recently, and he was able to immediately and without hesitation recite both his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s phone numbers.

That is the real problem with tracking of parents and -for that matter- the security agencies.
You should raise your children to be resilient. If they get lost, teach them how to get unlost. They should recognize danger by the stories we tell them and the experiences they had. Sometimes this goes wrong, and that is super sad, but things go wrong in life. There is no real way of preventing things to go wrong.

What constitutes consent?<p>If I finally agree to something after being nagged interminably - have I consented, or have I just given in?<p>At the other end of the spectrum, if someone asks for something which doesn&#x27;t particularly suit my purposes, but I agree to it as it seems fair enough - is that consent?<p>One situation seems like it is, the other one probably not. But where is the line? To me, consent seems like a vaguely letter-of-the-law, CYA type of word.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40520830" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40520830" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scotty79</span><span>|</span><a href="#40517658">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40521115">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40520830">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40520830">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is wild.

But being lost and figuring it out was necessary to learn the skills of how to navigate. today I have a very good sense of direction and this is not common among my peers.<p>I think while this sounds like a good idea, it actually hinders the learning process. Struggling is necessary in the learning experience, but you just don&#x27;t want too much struggle (there&#x27;s a balance). I think if your kids are old enough that you&#x27;re comfortable letting them navigate an area on their own, they are old enough to &quot;fend for themselves&quot; in this way. Just make sure they have your phone number and know the name of the hotel or some clear landmark (even in a foreign land you can often stumble about your confusion and say a landmark and people will be able to give you directions. Most of the time).<p>I think it is better for both the kids and parents. Kids need to learn independence, parents need to learn to trust their kids and that they can be independent (that is the goal after all, right?).

But that&#x27;s most likely the forestry service.<p>[0] We only load a single round and only when the person is ready to fire. So there is only one weapon loaded at any given time but weapons are __strictly__ treated as if loaded at all times. Weapons must also strictly be pointed down range (and not at the ground and not at the sky).

It seems to me that the fear is inspired by the remnants of the stranger danger panic and the very real threat of cars everywhere. Watches don&#x27;t really help alleviate any of those fears, nor replace the video games and other digital activities that would keep them in the house to begin with.

You can&#x27;t depend on technology in any situation, it&#x27;s better to know how to inherently learn from and handle it. This is when and how you learn as a child.<p>I took a motorized avalanche course in Canada the end of this last winter season. One of the most surprising things in the class was how easy it was to get in. I talked to the instructor (world renowned in the space of motorized avalanche training) about it and asked why there weren&#x27;t more students. He said that people buy the tools (avy beacon, probe, shovel, air bag, etc) but they no longer feel the need to learn how to use them.  Over the weekend we did about a half dozen real world scenarios and it was shocking to see how the theory was hard to execute the first few times.  The thing about an avalanche is that it doesn&#x27;t matter how good I am with my tools when I&#x27;m buried.  The last thing he mentioned in that part of our conversation was that people had recently started buying satellite communicators and that his theory was that it was enough of a security blanket for a lot of people who would have taken his classes like wilderness first aid.<p>The back country isn&#x27;t much different than a kid in a busy metro. If someone is going to take the child the watch isn&#x27;t going to do anything. That&#x27;s the first thing the assailant will get rid of.  At that point it&#x27;s up to your kid to know what move to make next.<p>Technology is continually being used as a crutch, especially with regard to our kids.

Contrast that, I work in the city and unless it&#x27;s right after when school lets out, I don&#x27;t see nearly as many kids just riding around. Perhaps it&#x27;s because they really stay inside the neighborhood or culdasac, but the city is small enough and well connected (Netherlands) with bike infrastructure, that I would expect to see more kids around.<p>Perhaps this is also influenced by the number of expats in the larger cities and those people are unsure of the safety&#x2F;normalcy aspect and tend to lean towards caution?

The greater the selection, the more free will you have.<p>Eg, if someone pulls a gun on you, you may think you have no free will.  However, if you have a gun of your own, you have a different set of options.  Similarly, if you are a trained martial artist or hostage negotiator, you will evaluate your options differently - you have more options.<p>Put simply one doesn&#x27;t know what one doesn&#x27;t know.

To get from a group that would have probably been quite homogeneous, to the extreme diversity of basically every single thing we see today - physical, ideological, cultural, etc - in such an incredibly short time frame, would suggest to me that even the briefest of moments apart sets us all on radically different courses.<p>Humans, relatively to most animals, also have an extremely slow generational time, which I think also further emphasizes this divergence.

- developing attention and aim,
- self-awareness&#x2F;emotional regulation development [which will clear past trauma and allow you to 1) be processing fully int he present moment or 2) extrapolate and prophesying-predicting into the future more accurately],
- developing a dynamic weighting process, and 
- honing your judgment, compassion, and forgiveness practices - as any logic for judgements you apply to others, that logic is also applied to yourself - whether you realize it or not, and will weigh you down - depress you and can increase your baseline stress and anger levels.<p>The above will raise your vibratory frequency from the patterns of thoughts and beliefs of yourself or others, which if they are negative then they will knock you and keep you down [and&#x2F;or require unnecessary and excessive energy to trying to prop yourself up with active motivation]; keeping you at a lower vibration - where like attracts like.<p>I do however do everything to avoid very low quality content - that we could call candy - like advertisements, however avoid may be the wrong word - I consciously act for high yield outcomes and quickly respond consciously to note when an unavoidable ad is present - and arguably am good at not getting distracted by them or go into a studying mode to analyze them to see what tactics they are deployed; ultimately they are a waste of time and can cause a misdirection of attention, but the consequences are far worse than that.<p>There are many very effective and efficient practices to help with all of the above - natural medicinal as well as things like yoga as a framework.</div><br/><div id="40154242" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40154242" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justsid</span><span>|</span><a href="#40153026">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40154218">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40153146">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40154242">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40154242">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reads like a scene from Silicon Valley.

I’ve written a few little comments about this in the past [1] but I’ve been meaning to explore the idea further. I originally began thinking this when I realized I could only remember a handful of details from books I had spent hours reading.<p>The short version is this: there’s nothing inherent about the format of a book that makes it ideal for learning. It is mostly a historical consequence of the fact that scratching symbols onto stone or paper, then replicating that paper&#x2F;stone is easier to develop than recording and playing back audio or video. Human beings spent thousands of years using languages that were purely spoken ones, and writing is a fairly recent thing historically speaking.<p>If somehow it became possible to record and play back spoken language thousands of years ago, writing might have never become a widespread thing at all. Even today, speech is how the vast majority of the world uses language. Let’s not forget how influential the book form has been on thought, from the Bible to the Quran, etc.<p>And so if you brush away the mystique and legacy of books and think about what an ideal learning format would be, I think it would be quite different from a book.

Now I am able to recall these things more often and many times they have guided me in my life or helping out friends.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40154857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40154857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eviks</span><span>|</span><a href="#40154616">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40152737">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40154857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40154857">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is just a convenient excuse, just like this<p>&gt; Education is something you have even if you don&#x27;t remember anything<p>Though the professor&#x27;s test is just as poor quality as the whole blog&#x27;s conversation where intellectual exercise is compared to remembering breakfasts</div><br/></div></div><div id="40152737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40152737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sharadov</span><span>|</span><a href="#40154857">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40155076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40152737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40152737">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve always believed that two things will broaden your horizon - travel and reading.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the means or the time to travel then your next best option is reading.</div><br/><div id="40153400" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40153400" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40152737">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40152765">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40153400">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40153400">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You don&#x27;t necessarily have to travel far to experience the benefits.

We &quot;need&quot; to qualify that, but I don&#x27;t think we really can. And that&#x27;s the problem with all such grand generalizations.<p>There was a point in my life when I was very self-conscious about the fact I haven&#x27;t really traveled by some people&#x27;s standards. It kinda gave birth to that silly desire to &quot;compete&quot;, to mark as &quot;visited&quot; as many countries as I could. And, I mean, traveling sure is nice, there was some void I filled doing that. But it was much quicker than I could expect, that this contest of sorts became totally meaningless, and I found out that I cannot even tell how many &quot;countries&quot; I visited.<p>First off, if the only time I was in a country was a long time ago on some guided tour, it somehow feels dishonest to me now to say I&#x27;ve &quot;been there&quot;. I feel like I need a refresher for it to actually count. Like, otherwise it&#x27;s as good as seeing a movie. Right?<p>Then, the mere saying that &quot;I have visited a country&quot; became kind of meaningless. What does it mean, to visit France? Nice is very different from Paris. Spending a couple of weeks in Alpine mountains (technically in France) kinda isn&#x27;t what people mean when they say they&#x27;ve been in France. So, how much of it I need to see to say I&#x27;ve traveled France?<p>Ok, probably it makes more sense to count cities. But what does it mean to visit a city? Do 6 hours in the downtown while I wait for a connecting flight count? Do a couple of days meaninglessly wandering the city count? Does a work trip (which I mostly spent in some office and in some hotel) count? Does spending several night drunk and high in Paris count &quot;visiting Paris&quot; same as walking famous museums and such? What is &quot;better&quot;?<p>Maybe I should rather limit my accounting to specific places, like offices, restaurants, museums? Like, instead of saying that I&#x27;ve been to Paris, should I say &quot;I&#x27;ve been in Louvre&quot;? By the way, how many days do you need to &quot;see Louvre&quot;? How long do I have to stare at each paining for it to count? Does it count at all, if I have no fucking idea what I&#x27;m staring at, and there&#x27;s nobody to tell me, why it&#x27;s significant?<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound cliche, especially in <i>that</i> way, but, honestly, I cannot even say that I&#x27;m completely familiar with the city I&#x27;ve been living in for the most of my life. There is not a &quot;good enough&quot; degree of &quot;visiting a place&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t exist. Your &quot;traveling&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily more meaningful than airline pilot&#x27;s &quot;traveling&quot; (or &quot;commuting&quot;, as another person in this thread tried to insult them). And there is no such thing as &quot;experience other cultures and ways of life&quot;. Experience your life and culture first and then come back to talk. (I wish to add &quot;in the next life&quot;, but it&#x27;s not like that &quot;next life&quot; of yours can be totally identical to the one you live now, even if it is spent at the same place, so I guess you&#x27;ll have to experience it first too.)<p>I wanted to also say a couple of things about reading the books, but this post is excessively large as it is. So, to summarize, all these &quot;horizon broadening&quot; contests are just vain and meaningless. Do whatever you want, read or visit whatever you want, and don&#x27;t feel inadequate if you don&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40155076" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40155076" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roodrax</span><span>|</span><a href="#40152737">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40154571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40155076">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40155076">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">the emerson quote just hits so hard and true</div><br/></div></div><div id="40154571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40154571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ArcMex</span><span>|</span><a href="#40155076">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40154792">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40154571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40154571">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Books, generally speaking, have changed my life for the better.

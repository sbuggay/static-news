He was above both male and female sink areas so he could see who was in there and chat to them sometimes or take requests - though we couldn&#x27;t see into the other toilet.<p>Then at Glastonbury a few year back there was a big club called NYC Downlow - in there there was a &#x27;secret&#x27; backroom with it&#x27;s own dj, but then off there there was a cupboard you could sneak into which had yet another DJ - we squeezed 17 into the cupboard.<p>Loved the connectedness you felt with someone who is working just to entertain you. It might just be music, but knowing someone is playing it for you really changes it for me, over just &#x27;musak&#x27;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37368249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37368249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TMWNN</span><span>|</span><a href="#37368457">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37368249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37368249">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">WordPerfect also had a DJ for its customer-service phone line.<p>I believe the WordPerfect reps informally tried to help with non-WordPerfect technical problems too, if only because so many people asked about them while on the phone.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

We do plan on taking another pass at analytics in July or August. I&#x27;ll give the system user_id a try, it&#x27;s entirely possible that will work for us and I have simply not gotten to an aha moment yet with the product (we are starting from scratch, so no segment data to import).<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure why this is completely blocking you, we have plenty of customers that just create a user with user_id &quot;system&quot; to track actions that aren&#x27;t tied into a specific user in a company.<p>It was never a technical problem, but a cognitive dissonance between the marketing and implementation details. I&#x27;ll do my best to narrate my internal dialogue as a potential buyer.<p>I come to the homepage and am intrigued by the words &quot;focused on companies&quot;—because that is absolutely what I want! I want company level metrics (sports teams in my case) to be the first class citizen. I actually do not care about user identification at all. There are a ton of products that already do that I can pick if I want. I assumed you might be able to drill down into user level metrics eventually, but I thought our v1 would not identify users at all.<p>Jumping over to the docs, I head to the tracking behavior section for companies. The user_id param being required does not fit with my idea of what June is at this point. Why would I need to identify a user, if this analytics is focused on companies?<p>To me, this data model suggests that this is a traditional analytics product that treats user + user events as first class, then rolls that up to do clever things at the analysis level for companies. I had expected company events to be the first class citizen and for the events to flow top down from there. Now I&#x27;m concerned that when I stick in a &#x27;team&#x27; user_id the data is going to be muddied, because the product won&#x27;t know that this hacked in ID is just a generic company thing. Does that mean my user based analytics are going to be off? What does that imply for the data&#x2F;reports downstream?<p>&gt; There isn&#x27;t really any drawback to that approach as you can filter out the system user from every analysis that doesn&#x27;t want to include them! Happy to support you on the implementation or answer any further doubts in our Intercom conversation thread :)<p>This comment highlights what I mean. If you are an analytics company focused on tracking companies, I expected it to just work that way out of the box. If I need to remember to filter out this user from a bunch of metrics or analyses, I am bound to forget at some point or bring on a teammate who doesn&#x27;t know.<p>Anyways, thanks again for the reply and hope the feedback is helpful.</div><br/><div id="36509459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36509459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xferruccio</span><span>|</span><a href="#36507059">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36509043">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36506374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36509459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36509459">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hey Matt thanks for the follow up explaining here!<p>I appreciate the feedback here on the user&#x2F;company focus.

I&#x27;ll reply inline to your points as I think others on the thread might have the same question<p>&gt; When you have simple SaaS platform, a platform like amplitude or mixpanel is generally enough capture these metrics. You can create these funnels in that product. The level of customization in these tools is pretty good too.<p>It&#x27;s true that you can create most of the features in June in Mixpanel or Amplitude. Setting up June as a small company though will take a lot less time and give you out of the box the most important things that you should be looking at.<p>As an example here&#x27;s an email from one of our users: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;UO1ZPOZ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;UO1ZPOZ</a><p>&gt; You can start with a basic tool, but everyone eventually moves to an advance product like amplitude or mix-panel for SaaS.<p>Interestingly we see the opposite, most of our paying customers were Mixpanel or Amplitude users that weren&#x27;t using those tools that much because of the effort involved to get some valuable information, preferring a simpler product for a shorter time to value<p>The way we see it is that in the long run - as we develop our product more and more, companies will have something like June for any use case that is not unique to their business (like launching a new feature, activating users, see how your biggest customer uses your product etc..) and a data warehouse with a BI tool for every analysis that is unique and only relevant to your specific business.<p>That being said right now we see that companies from the Series B stage onwards graduate out of using June and that&#x27;s totally fine for us for now. You can read more about our approach to building our product here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.june.so&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reaching-product-market-fit">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.june.so&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reaching-product-market-fit</a>)<p>&gt; One of the problem we have in my current startup is that we have multi-tenant customers, different deployment methods - on-prem&#x2F;managed etc. Platforms like amplitude, do not cater to these types of models. So, instead we built our own datawarehouse+metabase setup that gives us very granular control, reliability and assurance over the data, as well as we built lot of custom metrics.<p>One of the things we&#x27;re built for is that for every event you send you can specify what tenant performed that action and every report works both at a user level and at a company level. (see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.june.so&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;6789004-how-to-track-companies-in-june">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.june.so&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;6789004-how-to-track-compan...</a>) For other tools company tracking is an add-on to the core product, for us it&#x27;s the core.<p>So not only you know how many users use your product, but you can look at the behaviour of individual tenants for every metric you&#x27;re looking at. Additionally for every tenant we automatically generate reports for that specific company, so when your Customer Success or Sales people hop on a call with customers they have answers to questions like &quot;how much are they using our product?&quot;, &quot;who are their top users?&quot; and &quot;have they started using all of our core features?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a long answer, but hope it addresses some of your doubts :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36514636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36514636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sskates</span><span>|</span><a href="#36506374">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36510732">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36514636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36514636">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ferruccio and Enzo- congratulations on the launch of June!

You don&#x27;t need to cater to all the scenarios that Amplitude or Mixpanel or Heap cater to which narrows the scope of what to ask of users (and what you need to build!)<p>*  Honing in on SaaS means you can offer canned AARRR reports and key feature usage reports out of the box which massively accelerates that.<p>* Pulling metrics from where they already live and transforming them into immediately useful data for PMs.  CDPs like Segment enable that but you could even de-risk customer migration to June by pulling data from Mix or Amplitude<p>Congrats on hitting 1k customers.

We&#x27;re a small but growing team with around a thousand customers between our products.<p>The two products are quite different, one a web-based and more of an aid, where retention and such metrics make sense. Here we&#x27;ve experienced companies replacing the sole person using our application, the new hire doesn&#x27;t get taught about our tool or forgets, and suddenly they&#x27;re wondering about these bills they&#x27;re getting. We&#x27;ve got multiple companies where we&#x27;ve successfully sold our product to several times.<p>The other is a more traditional CRUD application, which users have to use to get their job done. As such retention and similar isn&#x27;t a very relevant metric. However it has a large number of modules, and a lot of new functionality in each release, so feature tracking is more interesting. Perhaps failure&#x2F;error tracking too, like how many manage to trigger certain errors and warnings, indicating a potential weak UI.<p>I mean the main screenshot shows a &quot;Features&quot; panel, but we have several hundred features we&#x27;d like to track, maybe thousands depending on how we can filter on event properties. We have quite a lot of core modules, almost all of which are per-country, so we need to be able to look at module usage per country for example. In addition a large portion of our customers have one or more custom integrations (some have over a dozen, again per-country in relevant countries). I wasn&#x27;t able to see if we&#x27;d get the insight we need for this use-case.<p>In either case we&#x27;re quite worried about PII, and while it&#x27;s nice you got GDPR covered, I think we don&#x27;t want any PII connected to our users. It&#x27;s interesting to know how many users use a feature at a given company, but we don&#x27;t really want to know who that is. From what I can gather that should be OK, just use some UUID for each user and leave it at that?<p>Perhaps these are dumb questions, product analytics isn&#x27;t my forte and as mentioned we&#x27;re just exploring the options at the moment, so don&#x27;t have any direct experience yet.<p>That said, June does look really interesting. Especially since we don&#x27;t have anyone who can dedicate a lot of time to this task.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36506324" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36506324" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MoSattler</span><span>|</span><a href="#36516298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36513147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36506324">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36506324">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just a quick heads-up, your marketing site seems quite slow on Safari for Mac.</div><br/><div id="36507483" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36507483" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xferruccio</span><span>|</span><a href="#36506324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36513147">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36507483">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36507483">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for reporting this - I think we need to optimise some of our heavier animations and lazy load some of them :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36513147" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36513147" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomredman</span><span>|</span><a href="#36506324">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36506068">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36513147">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36513147">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Love to see this guys, great work and love to this pivot working for you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36506068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36506068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sidcool</span><span>|</span><a href="#36513147">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36514998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36506068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36506068">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems like you just launched it in June.

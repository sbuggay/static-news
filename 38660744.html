It was just a toy model but it showed that as you increased rent your vacancy rate would go up. Not surprisingly. But the interesting bit was you Maximised income at about a 15% vacancy rate. So in an unregulated market driven situation you would be leaving money on the table if you did not keep reaching prices until you priced some people out. It was a light bulb moment for me to see that this was a rational result even if it “felt” greedy to me. Now I think about these kind of issues as being unbalanced models. Add tax, Air B&amp;B, local regulations, portfolio structure, and a range of other factors and typically the state of vacancy rates in and area will make sense.</div><br/><div id="38662148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38662148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jedberg</span><span>|</span><a href="#38662116">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662486">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38662148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38662148">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It sounds like your model assumed all apartments would be the same price for the same unit.  But that isn&#x27;t how the real world works.  You start with the high rent and then come down as it sits vacant.  Different units in the building with the same amenities might rent for different amounts.<p>If your rent is $2000 and no one will come in, it makes sense to drop your rent to $1850 if it gets someone in now, because at the end of the year you&#x27;ll break even vs sitting just one extra month vacant at $2000.<p>The main reason that doesn&#x27;t happen in NYC in particular is rent control&#x2F;stabilization -- dropping the rent lowers your baseline.<p>In most cities, you can make up that rent with an increase at the end of the year.

B, splitting equity in real estate amongst several &#x2F; dozens of people is a really bad idea; since everyone gets a veto, the more people who get a say, the more unlikely it is to achieve consensus on anything from repairs to renovations to selling to a developer so that land which has a few housing units on it can have dozens or hundreds of housing units on it.</div><br/><div id="38662489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38662489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kyle-rb</span><span>|</span><a href="#38661720">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662380">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38662489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38662489">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I disagree that unionization fundamentally sets interests of labor against their employer.<p>lol I didn&#x27;t say anything close to that.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t actually get equity in early stage companies; you get options on equity<p>Depends on the company, but it&#x27;s the same alignment of incentives either way.<p>&gt; not all landlords suck<p>Only the sucky landlords should have an issue with this legislation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38662064" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38662064" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">redserk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38661720">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662037">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662055">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38662064">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38662064">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Abusing the market is also deeply detrimental to social cohesion.<p>Many market actors have an expectation of fairness with the parties they transact with, but this expectation can only be realized if parties maintain some degree of honesty with each other.<p>One set of actors (some landlords) is not being honest by withholding a very constrained resource (housing) from the marketplace.

The city&#x27;s politicians are publicly very pro-immigration, but the city&#x27;s housing stock is limited by zoning and shadow ordinances that heavily restrict the ability of anyone to build more housing. When faced with any situation that requires unwinding this mess, which would be _very_ unpopular with too many people, doing nothing takes precedent, the other supposed values and beliefs crumble, and rent rises another $1,000&#x2F;month.<p>New York City needs more housing. But that&#x27;s not going to happen easily. There was a huge outcry when the wealthy neighborhoods of SoHo and NoHo were planning to be upzoned, and although it went through, it proved how much of an uphill climb it is to say &quot;You are allowed to build tall buildings in Manhattan&quot;.<p>A lot of people here with some awareness of the housing market in the US will see claims of apartment warehousing, and refuse to believe it. In the entire rest of the country, they would be right to not believe it. But in New York, with its insane implementation of rent control (applying to apartments, not tenants), this frequently means that some rent-controlled apartments, upon being vacated, require repairs to meet code that cost more than could ever be recouped at the legal amount it can be rented for. I don&#x27;t know what counting these apartments is supposed to achieve. These apartments are only ever vacated upon death. Tenants literally pass them down to their children, who get to enjoy huge Manhattan apartments for $1,300&#x2F;month: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mualphaxi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1700952175508168819" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mualphaxi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1700952175508168819</a><p>I don&#x27;t know of anyone who believes passing down rent-controlled apartments as an inheritance is a good system. You get to pay 1&#x2F;4-1&#x2F;5 rent because your parents lived there for decades before you when it became rent-&quot;stabilized&quot;? This is the kind of Nativism you wouldn&#x27;t expect from a city run by Democrats, but if you ask the renters who live there, the only problem with this system is that it didn&#x27;t stabilize rents for everyone. The huge shortage of housing doesn&#x27;t even factor into the equation, despite being the single biggest cause of rent going for $4,000-6,000&#x2F;month.<p>Rent control (and generally, all price controls) should be used rarely and judiciously, only in the extreme case where a necessity in very short supply is being sold for obscene prices. We saw what happens when you do this en masse to all housing in Berlin and in Ireland. In a housing shortage and with strict price caps, you trade a crisis of too-high rents with a crisis of too-few units available for rent. There is huge pent-up demand for housing when there are shortages. When not managed by prices, it&#x27;s managed by rationing, by long lines, by sending dozens and hundreds of applications, by being considered &quot;likely to vacate&#x2F;move out&quot; by the landlord not wanting to get stuck charging the same rent for 60 years. The solution to the shortage isn&#x27;t to ration and control housing prices, it&#x27;s to increase the production of housing.<p>But of course that&#x27;s not happening. In Europe, North America, and Australia alike, you have a hodge podge of zoning laws restricting 80% of _urban areas_ to detached single family homes, &quot;historically&quot; designated buildings and neighborhoods (that can never be torn down), and all kinds of ordinances that prevent buildings from casting shadows, from using too much of the lot, from not having enough parking, from having too-small units, from not having enough affordable units (often defined such that building profitably and legally is impossible), and for many other ridiculous and absurd reason.<p>I really have zero patience for these &quot;Count the purposefully vacant apartment units!&quot; political positions, given how severely divorced this is from the real nature and causes of the housing affordability crisis. It&#x27;s silly. It&#x27;s absurd. It&#x27;s a public display of gross ignorance at best, and malicious misdirection at worst.<p>Prices are high because you made it illegal to build enough apartments. Apartments are being kept empty because of your absurd system of rent stabilization and tenant protections that go too far. Condos are kept empty because your property taxes are too low.<p>The solutions to this problem are very technically simple. The politicians, landlords, property owners, and tenants just don&#x27;t want them because they each have very strong incentives to not solve the problem.</div><br/><div id="38662278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38662278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">soundarana</span><span>|</span><a href="#38662049">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38662278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38662278">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you build more housing in NY and rent goes down, more people will move to NY because they can now afford it and push rents back up.<p>London is also very expensive to rent and it&#x27;s not rent controlled.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38662189" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38662189" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jimmaswell</span><span>|</span><a href="#38662049">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662278">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38662189">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38662189">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If tenant protections went too far then landlords wouldn&#x27;t find it worth it, yet they still do.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38662389" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38662389" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quickthrower2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38662049">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662189">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662170">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38662389">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38662389">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So let’s get this straight:<p>Parents pass down rent controlled appartment $1300&#x2F;m = horror<p>Parents pass doen paid off owned appartment $0&#x2F;m = meh<p>This is just a transfer of wealth between 2 people: the apartment owner got less wealthy and the rent control inheritor got more wealthy.

Right now not renting it out saves then tax due to the “loss” they declare. But the price at which they’d have to rent the commercial unit to exceed that tax benefit would be high enough to cause a reappraisal of the entire building which would increase the property tax for all the residential units they pay as well, which would mean they’re losing money, or at least making less money, on each unit until they can increase the rent to level which may not be sustained by the market.<p>Another well known non government reason to leave units vacant is if the market value has dropped, leading it out at the lower market value can trigger all sorts of problems for the property owner with the banks who have lent money to them for the property, including the ability for them to recall the money early, change rates, etc since it may trigger clauses regd the appraised value dropping below a certain threshold. These are purely private contracts that provide a very strong incentive for landlords to keep spaces empty rather than lease them out at market value.

It&#x27;s silly to not offer your vacant unit for lease at record-high rents &#x27;hoping&#x27; that one day rents may be even higher. Every month you&#x27;re vacant you&#x27;re losing on $3000+. You really think rent growth can outrun missing out on $3000&#x2F;month, every month? Every month you wait relies on a rent growth rate of ~9% per <i>month</i> just to break even on a 1-year lease if you have no ability to raise rents. I don&#x27;t know where this theory comes from, but I can&#x27;t find any data to support it.<p>When the Berkeley city council passed their tax on vacant units their own analysis indicated that about 1128 units in Berkeley were potentially vacant. Of them only 40% are actually vacant, so about 451 units. Of them, a number are actually being renovated, a number are being rented out without informing the city and about 100 of them are in totally derelict buildings that aren&#x27;t fit for living in. It&#x27;s all in the council&#x27;s assessment on page 2. [1] Berkeley has 46,875 units. So that&#x27;s a worst case of 2.4% vacancy rate - but more realistically we&#x27;re talking &lt;1%.<p>The only thing to be done is build more homes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;berkeleyca.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2022-07-26%20Special%20Item%2006%20Placing%20a%20General%20Tax%20Measure.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;berkeleyca.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2022-07...</a></div><br/><div id="38661854" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38661854" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajmurmann</span><span>|</span><a href="#38661542">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661775">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38662197">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38661854">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38661854">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for adding some concrete numbers!<p>Even with the 2.4%, that means an apartment is empty less than a month every three years.

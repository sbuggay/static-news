&gt; In other words how do I choose which projects to support? How do I detect when said support is above board or when there are other factors?<p>Same argument can be applied to closed-source software. For example, how do you decide which vendor is your company going to select for their internal or external business. Why did you choose Cisco security solution over Fortinet or whatever other alternative there is? Is it corruption in terms of &quot;I know this guy in Cisco&quot; or is it &quot;their solution is the most powerful&quot;? Essentially, as you say, it is indistinguishable.

For simplicity let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a direct dependency, though I think everything here applies to indirect ones as well.<p>Let&#x27;s consider the options.<p>Option 1: never pay a dime for it. This works in so far as someone else picks up the bill. So really there are two sub-cases:<p>Option 1(a): the project is successful enough that it&#x27;s self-sustaining. What this really means is that someone else (or multiple someone elses) picked up the bill. Congrats, you lucked out.<p>Option 1(b): the project is insufficiently funded and either dies or has a major security breach. Now you end up paying either for the security breach fallout and&#x2F;or to replace the component, possibly on short notice, with something else. Or you maintain it yourself and start paying that cost, again possibly on short notice.<p>Is that really worth it? Do you think so? I&#x27;m betting all those costs are higher than it would have cost to maintain it in the first place. Because anything you do in an emergency is more expensive, and you&#x27;re paying the cost of losing all the context in the development of the project itself (if someone leaves before you start maintaining it).<p>Option 2: pay for the software in the first place, making the cost predictable and avoiding a low-probability high-impact failure mode. Honestly, given all the risk management companies do, this seems worth it to me. At least if the dependency is critical enough.<p>Obviously you won&#x27;t do this with any random open source project.

In recent years my view of the whole thing has soured a lot. There seems to be few compelling incentives to actually develop or participate in open-source software.<p>Open source first felt to me like a way to give power back to ordinary people, and it still is, but it seems like those who get the <i>most</i> benefit from free labor are large corporations. Open source feels increasingly corporate and companies like Microsoft dominate and reap enormous benefits. I’ll work for Joe Neighbor for free but not Sataya Nadella.<p>Open source was always political but in 2010 (around when I started getting into Linux) it felt like dumb arguments over things like programming languages or “the UNIX philosophy”. Now it feels like a vicious Red vs Blue culture war where not picking a side is just as bad as picking the other side.<p>Contributing to open source is a thankless job and even if your project is really good, most people won’t care and the few that do might still treat you like crap. I’ve submitted a handful of pull requests and I’ve already run into the classic “Your patch works and provides a feature some people might like, but I don’t like it, go away.”<p>I’ve donated plenty to organizations like Mozilla, Wikipedia, and GNOME. I then email them with my opinions on what they’re doing. In nearly every case not only am I ignored completely, I see those projects (Mozilla especially) continue to drift in a direction that I disagree with. So, I stopped donating.<p>For me, the Linux kernel is probably one of the few big open source projects where 1) the project is technically interesting enough that I would learn a lot by contributing, 2) It seems like politics and infighting is kept under control, 3) it actually seems <i>possible</i> to get a patch in while having a 9-5, 4) I use the product myself every day and enjoy it, and 5) the technical direction feels positive in that it is getting regular features &amp; bug fixes that I like</div><br/><div id="41605251" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41605251" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Qem</span><span>|</span><a href="#41583207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41591814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41605251">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41605251">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but it seems like those who get the most benefit from free labor are large corporations.<p>One factor is the lack of adoption of copyleft licenses.

Consider the world of hardware emulation. Sure the community has benefited massively from the efforts poured into reverse engineering and understanding old systems and games and preserving what was there. And the big corporations reap huge benefits in the form of continuing nostalgia, awareness of their back catalog of IP, test markets and information about the viability of re-releases and in some cases the licensing (or outright theft) of emulators and emulator code for selling their own retro consoles.<p>Burn out is absolutely a concern, and the approach of some open source devs (like IIRC the curl dev) of essentially “f you, pay me” to support requests is probably an important thing to have. But for me as an individual, the fact that Atari’s current owners have reaped massive rewards from the fact that the emulation scene keeps their brand alive means nothing to me. I’d rather have the world we have were things are open and the community is there, than one were emulation is closed and insular and getting into it is even harder than it already is just to keep Atari from “winning” the most.

Their re-releases and re-masters and dumping of money into manufacturing by hardware retro clones puts money into the market, gives new hardware to tinker with or build on. And their dependence on the open efforts of the community also means bending that hardware to my own needs is much easier than if they had for example just rolled out a bunch of new proprietary SoCs to replace the old hardware with a single blob chip</div><br/></div></div><div id="41607955" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607955" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">photonthug</span><span>|</span><a href="#41583207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41591814">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41584446">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607955">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607955">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I’ve submitted a handful of pull requests and I’ve already run into the classic “Your patch works and provides a feature some people might like, but I don’t like it, go away<p>Same.

Jeez, kids these days. As a movement it&#x27;s really only about 30 years old, and that in two separate phases:<p>1. The GPL&#x2F;GNU period. The software is mostly called &quot;free software-as-in-freedom&quot;. The community is small, volunteer driven, highly ideological and focused primarily on cloning UNIX for commodity PC hardware. Most developers aren&#x27;t using this stuff at all and work with entirely commercial toolchains.<p>2. The Apache 2 period. The software is mostly called &quot;open source&quot;. The community is huge, frequently driven by corporate donations, not particularly ideological anymore and focused on developer tools &#x2F; libraries rather than operating systems and desktop apps. Developers now regularly incorporate open source libraries into their commercial programs.<p>The transition was slow but I&#x27;d pick 2008-2010 as the crossing over point. Before that time if someone said they wrote open source software you&#x27;d make a weak assumption that they worked somehow on Linux related projects in their evenings&#x2F;weekends. After that time you&#x27;d probably assume they were writing some library and had even odds it was their job.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that 2008+ is ZIRP territory. Money was &quot;free&quot; for investors, so investment piled into a lot of stuff that often wasn&#x27;t revenue generating because there was nowhere else for it to go. This era was also shaped by a historical aberration - a handful of hyper successful advertising companies whose founders were able to remain in control whilst still selling much of their stock thanks to dual voting classes. Modern developer&#x27;s understanding of the open source ecosystem, along with their expectation that powerful tools are all free, is very much shaped by the combination of Fed policy and a handful of super rich patron companies that weren&#x27;t under any pressure to return capital to shareholders.<p>Thing is none of these factors (ideology, free money, stock with dual voting classes) is historically normal or arguably sustainable over the long run, whereas ordinary capitalism is. So we might well see a reversion to the mean where things like compilers, libraries, operating systems etc become commercial again as relatively high interest rates pull funds out of tech and the supply of Stallmanists devoted to the cause of desktop GNU&#x2F;Linux continues to dwindle. The recent death of a man who reverse engineered a lot of networking hardware for Linux is an example of this - how many 25 year old hackers want to do that sort of thing any more? They&#x27;re all writing JS frameworks that only work on AWS these days.<p>If that does happen though it&#x27;ll be quite slow. I think the industry would need a kind of Steam for libraries to emerge first, and it&#x27;s pretty unclear what the next equilibrium phase looks like.</div><br/><div id="41601412" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41601412" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dartos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41582109">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41600352">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41601412">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41601412">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">30 years is the majority of the existence of personal computers have been available.

Personal computers had existed for quite a long time by then. The Apple Mac launched in 1984.<p>Open source did exist in 1994: projects like Linux and Python were started around 1991 but nearly nobody knew about them or used them. The average person or developer in 1994 had zero encounters with open source software. Even by 2000 this was still the case: the average developer was working with Visual Basic or Delphi or Visual Studio (all proprietary) using  the Windows API or VBX&#x2F;OCX controls as libraries (proprietary), connecting to Oracle, SQL Server or Access for data (proprietary) and if they were bold, rendering web UIs from IIS or Netscape&#x27;s servers (proprietary) to Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator (all proprietary). If they were cutting edge like Google they might be using Linux as a server kernel, but that was rare and a source of competitive advantage. Google wrote all of its own internal libraries starting from the STL upwards partly because there just weren&#x27;t that many to adopt if you worked on Linux.<p><i>&gt; It’s just hard to find learning resources on reverse engineering hardware, since that isn’t the entry point for programmers anymore.</i><p>Well, two books is a lot. Back in the day there were none :) I think this shows the issue, right? Yes there are more developers overall, but there are also more opportunities and things to do. Why would you spend hours slaving over a buggy wifi driver when you could try your hand at writing a mobile app instead, which might make you rich? Back in the 90s this was far less of an option for most developers. The original motivation was a desire to use something other than Windows on PC class hardware, but that desire has been satiated by Apple for a long time and desktop Linux remains obscure.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced all of this. My first open source project was on Windows, back when open source was novel and new. Then I worked on Linux for a while - I had code in Wine and GNOME and a few other things. Then I wrote open source libraries and took part in Bitcoin. These days I do open source work for pay and also sell a proprietary developer tool. So, seen it from every angle. My gut feeling is that we&#x27;re going to see a resurgence of proprietary platforms and libraries in the coming years.</div><br/><div id="41606708" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41606708" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dartos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41582109">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41604886">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41607966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41606708">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41606708">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Why would you spend hours slaving over a buggy wifi driver when you could try your hand at writing a mobile app instead, which might make you rich?<p>People do get paid to write Linux WiFi drivers.

The second and third major contributions happened because they shipped on a proprietary platform that was built on top of an OSS release, and the company didn&#x27;t want to maintain those parts in the proprietary layer.<p>After I left the first company they provided zero maintenance support for the major upstream feature, and I won&#x27;t maintain it on an individual basis because life moves far too quickly for that.

Collaboration culture seems to be very diminished, some try be moral police, some simply do not care etc;<p>- mere widespread lack of competence mixing, in the past with usenet newcomers and gurus was together, interact and share visions, doubts etc, make all people involved learn. Today with Reddit and co people are divided, gurus with gurus, newcomers with newcomers, these are Indian castes with extremely little &quot;social mobility&quot; and that&#x27;s a large part of why the mean culture is collapsed and almost all new projects not only in FLOSS but in the whole society are failures;<p>- lack of a good software base, modern software designed by commercial&#x2F;managerial needs are CRAP, even the finest one, not because the code is crap, but because the environment is. An OS need to be a single application where anyone can automate their small bits at their competence level, this mode was killed because compartmentalizing anything means more products to sell, this is technically unsustainable and most modern people works in such environments and many young have no idea of the old mode and it&#x27;s power, as a result good tools left behind, those who know them isolated, newcomers suffer from the lack of proper tooling and can&#x27;t progress;<p>- finally the &quot;slavery flat line with a dot on top&quot;, meaning only few nowadays do things, the giants, others are essentially their slaves. Most companies have no iron, no operation in house, just sitting on the shoulders of giants, using their iron and operation through their interfaces&#x2F;services. This means the social FLOSS ecosystem does not exists anymore.<p>More and more people burned by this model try to go FLOSS, off the cloud etc, but they lack tools and competence and resurface from such disaster it&#x27;s damn not easy since still the largest part of the world is in the barbaric land of the giants where even damn simple things are complicated because that&#x27;s makes the money for someone.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41607149" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607149" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DoreenMichele</span><span>|</span><a href="#41608196">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41593288">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607149">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607149">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know how we resolve this.

The simple truth unpaid hobbyists and hackers should not be involved in the development enterprise operating systems. Windows NT was not developed by unpaid hackers. Why should that apply to Linux? Unix was developed by corporate employees, and it is only when the GNU project decided to replicate the toolsets it used that Linus decided to build a kernel of his own, after which corporations jumped on it because of the GPL.<p>Those days are long gone and hobbyists and part timers shouldn&#x27;t be really involved. It is OK to write and develop programs gain a sense of achievement and pride from them, but when the need to maintain it kicks in that is when it all starts to south.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41597819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41597819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">corinroyal</span><span>|</span><a href="#41591692">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41592120">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41594007">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41597819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41597819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Solution is to stop using languages low level like C except where it matters, and improve the UI capabilities of higher level like Lisp.<p>This is my conclusion too. None of the reasons C&#x2F;UNIX won are valid anymore and it&#x27;s essential kludgyness has cost us incalculable time, money and brain space.  Imagine what the open source community might have achieved with a real high-level language. Instead we&#x27;ve given them layer upon layer of inadequate tools and told them that if they can&#x27;t manage the mess they are too dumb. So we spend more and more time in maintenance than in development. Who wants to juggle pointers, increment counters, and do their own garbage collection in a Jenga tower when they could just write their own nouns and verbs in Lisp? I&#x27;ll be working on exactly this.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41594007" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41594007" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sirspacey</span><span>|</span><a href="#41591692">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41594007">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41594007">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As unpopular as this opinion may be:<p>AI solves this problem long term<p>We need way more code than anyone is willing to pay for.<p>OSS has been a great foundation for GenAI progress in coding.</div><br/><div id="41607629" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41607629" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lionkor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41594007">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41607629">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41607629">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

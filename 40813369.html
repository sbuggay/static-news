Basically, for OTC drugs that were initially approved before 1962, many are still on the market despite sometimes having weak efficacy data. While the FDA has been making some progress in reevaluating these older drugs, we&#x27;re still far from where we should be.<p>A few quotes from the conclusion of the article (but the entire piece I linked in SA is worth a read!):<p>&gt; In 2023, 16 external experts on the second Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee looked at all the evidence compiled by FDA staff, heard manufacturers&#x27; arguments in favor of oral phenylephrine&#x27;s efficacy, and heard from experts like me who argued that oral phenylephrine is ineffective. In the end, they concluded that oral phenylephrine is not GRASE. A final ruling on whether decongestants containing the drug can still be sold will take time. We hope science will prevail.<p>&gt; From this experience we&#x27;ve learned that the monograph process for OTC drugs approved before 1962 needs to be reexamined. Systematic reviews of the available evidence indicate that other nonprescription drugs such as guaifenesin (sold in Mucinex and Robitussin), dextromethorphan (sold in Robitussin DM) and antihistamines marketed for colds (for instance, chlorpheniramine) probably don&#x27;t help with coughs and colds. They are usually not dangerous, but their effects are likely to be the result of a placebo response; more modern research is needed.<p>&gt; The outcome for oral phenylephrine shows that the FDA needs more funding to look at old drugs. We need public funds to support independent researchers who want to examine these products objectively. The government should be able to spend millions to save consumers billions on ineffective products. Companies that market these products have no incentive to prove they don&#x27;t work. Nonprescription drugs must be effective, not just safe.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40815581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40815581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">addicted</span><span>|</span><a href="#40815272">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817464">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40815581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40815581">[57 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d argue it’s the opposite.<p>Look at what’s happened since Oxycontin was heavily regulated.<p>Opioid deaths in America have exploded by an order of magnitude.<p>There’s a direct correlation between higher regulation of OxyContin and opioid deaths in the U.S.<p>The Sacklers have done illegal stuff. Misrepresenting the addictiveness of their drugs (well, it was immoral and wrong…it’s not clear how illegal it was).<p>But it’s quite clear that America had a parallel opioid crisis going on. By making OxyContin easily available, ie, a slow acting opioid (it had to be crushed to be fast acting) that was produced legitimately and had a legitimate supply chain so people were able to get exactly what they wanted, Purdue Pharma helped keep the number of opioid deaths under control.<p>IOW, the U.S. has had an addiction crisis that is independent of prescription drugs whose cause is not clear yet because everyone has thrown the blame on Oxy instead of researching it. This is the same kind of drug crisis that hit inner cities in the 20th century but has hit rural areas in the 21st century. By providing easy access to regulated and legitimate opioids the Sacklers may have marginally worsened the addiction crisis, but they minimized the number of deaths and severe negative impacts.<p>The moment Oxy and the other opioids were made less easy to get, the underlying drug crisis hadn’t gone anywhere, so instead the people suffering from the crisis had to get their opioids from illicit sources as opposed to the pharmacy, exposing them to all sorts of unregulated drugs that had all sorts of nonsense like Fenranyl mixed in, which causes the actual negative impacts of the drug crisis to explode.<p>The funny thing is that when the entire country was just absolutely united at making the Sacklers the big bad evil, the actual people working on the ground trying to help those who were facing this drug crisis were predicting this exact situation and were asking authorities to not clamp down on Oxy. But they were all ignored and so we have a situation where opioid OD deaths have gone from a consistent 10-15,000&#x2F;year (a rate which preceded Oxy) to about 50,000&#x2F;yr now.</div><br/><div id="40816367" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816367" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skellera</span><span>|</span><a href="#40815272">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816367">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816367">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you one of the lawyers?<p>None of that would’ve happened if they didn’t start the flood of opiates to begin with.

This led to pill mills and crooked doctors. You had normal people getting hooked on high dosages. These are not the people who were using opioids before that. Pills made it seem safer. Most users don’t start with heroin, they start with pills because of exactly that. “A doctor prescribed it, must be okay.”<p>This is some insane logic to absolve them of responsibility.

WW1 was also only mentioned very briefly (maybe a couple weeks? Archduke is shot, shit goes down) and then we spent a fair bit of time on WW2, but less than we spent on Ancient Egypt honestly. (I think we spent an entire 2 or 3 months on Ancient Egypt).<p>We spent a fair amount of time on the Reformation and Renaissance, ancient Greece and Rome, and US history was mostly a ~bullshit~ censored history of the founding of the US. The Washington State history classes went into some history of the local tribes, but failed to mention any of the fun details about how Seattle was founded (prostitution, drinking, Seattle literally poisoning the wells of nearby towns to force them to join Seattle to get access to clean water)<p>College was better, mostly US history and World History, still nothing about the far east though.<p>We did an excellent segment on the US Revolution in College, including the funding source behind the revolutionary war, that was very interesting.<p>Edit: Sex ed was pretty comprehensive, and we ended the quarter by watching Rocky Horror Picture Show, so that was fun. (The Nerd and Goth kids formed a voting block for what movie to watch. :D) I am still surprised they talked about so much about forms of contraceptives that almost no one uses (spermicidal gels and foams), but at least they properly demonstrated how to use a condom, so that was good.<p>For &quot;don&#x27;t smoke&quot; the health teacher had lots of pictures of tumors.<p>Alcohol wasn&#x27;t really talked about, but honestly in the 90s we didn&#x27;t know a much about how unhealthy it is as we do now. (Doctors knew it was bad, but just in the last few years research has come out showing that the safe amount of drinking is none)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40816731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shadowgovt</span><span>|</span><a href="#40815272">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815922">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815991">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816731">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What lesson should the opium wars have taught that&#x27;s applicable to oxy prescription?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40816865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0x00_NULL</span><span>|</span><a href="#40815272">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815724">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815860">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816865">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That’s gotta be the most ignorant opinion I’ve heard on the subject.

During my recovery, there wasn’t an option of alternate anything - I got a lot of morphine and then oxy. I was discharged 4 weeks later from the hospital with a 3 month prescription for 120mg of opioids per day. That would kill most people.<p>My story is not unique. It is so common it could be a troupe.

The specialized hospital cleaning crews are in the ER every day and dozens of hours per week in the OR, but that doesn’t allow them to practice medicine or perform surgery. Proximity is not the same as practice.<p>The medical practice (until a few years ago) was profoundly and intentionally misinformed about the addictiveness of Oxycodone and Oxycontin. You brought up a question about why people didn&#x27;t learn from the Opioid Wars, but your flippant question could just as easily be applied to the MDs who wrote the prescriptions.<p>Medical doctors are smart; they MUST know about the Opioid Wars and the horror the opium wrecked on Chinese society for centuries. Why would they prescribe such a dangerously addictive compound to injured and vulnerable people having the worst day of their lives?<p>Instead, you blame patients with little choice (or capacity to evaluate choices) in a terrible situation. And, if you talked to any addicts, you&#x27;d sure find that the top of the &quot;victim totempole&quot; is actually really crowded with people who got there the exact same way. That is no coincidence.<p>The fact of the matter is that Purdue intentionally misinformed everyone - doctors, patients, caregivers, and family. They used marketing, propaganda, bribes, recognition, and myriad other tools to convince everyone that their product was different. Doctors, knowing full well about the Opium Wars, wholeheartedly believed the propaganda. I wasn&#x27;t the first patient to be discharged from the hospital with a multi-month supply of opioids. This was a common practice.<p>The worst part is for someone who claims to be around addicts, you think I am somehow unique in my story. My story is so mundanely typical that it should be nauseating. Medical treatment is, by far, the most common way addicts start with opioids. 75% of all heroin users whose addictions started in the 2000s reported that it began with prescriptions from their doctors.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nida.nih.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;prescription-opioids-heroin&#x2F;prescription-opioid-use-risk-factor-heroin-use" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nida.nih.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;prescript...</a><p>I genuinely suggest you spend some time talking to the addicts around you rather than judging them.

The cause of the Afghani farmers growing opium was the insatiable demand for opium that was developed through legal means. Then, when countries like the US started to restrict access to opiates, addicts and patients alike started to seek alternatives to the scarce prescriptions.<p>More to the point, why didn&#x27;t patients use something else? Because there is nothing. Purdue&#x27;s misinformation actively discouraged the discovery of new non-addictive compounds for decades. No one was looking, and the R&amp;D pipeline ran dry.<p>By the time enough doctors sounded enough alarms to cause a change in the late 2010s, research in non-addictive pain management solutions was decades behind. No one engaged in it because there was no need for it. Now that we realize it was all a lie and these drugs have killed millions, there are no alternatives. Very few potential compounds are even in Phase 2 clinical trials right now, let alone the half dozen that would be needed in Phase 3 to ensure we have a single alternate choice for pain management in the next five years.<p>So, the outlook looks bleak. Today, in 2024, we don&#x27;t have good ways to manage pain that is non-addictive, and certainly no good way to reach the millions who are hopelessly addicted to opioids for pain management. But, very little of this is the patient&#x27;s fault - and a lot of this is directly related to the monumental efforts of Purdue to misinform for profit.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40815665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40815665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kidme5</span><span>|</span><a href="#40815272">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816907">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817086">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40815665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40815665">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">username &quot;addicted&quot; eh?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40817086" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40817086" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">idiotsecant</span><span>|</span><a href="#40815272">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815665">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40817086">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40817086">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a <i>lot</i> in this post that is ...questionable in my opinion but I just have to call out as especially creative the praise for a drug that is so safe and slow-acting that it won&#x27;t have harmful fast acting effects unless you...

Let&#x27;s use them!<p>This is conflating two things.<p>It is not criminal to move money offshore, and nothing suggested any money laundering occurred, because it is not necessary to launder money to move it offshore. And it is also not money laundering to obfuscate money&#x27;s origin or destination. Money laundering requires a criminal origin and then obfuscation.<p>Despite how much the US has convinced its entire culture to stigmatize the concept of moving money, the US is operating in its own bubble of hubris to suggest money has to stay within its ecosystem. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all when you say it out loud does it?<p>To your second point, the US has reporting laws on money held offshore legally, for US citizens. For banks, this is merely an additional compliance burden that disincentivizes them from dealing with small accounts because its not worth it. But at Sackler money, it is worth it. It is not hard to find someone to bank you as an American. And at Sackler levels of money you don&#x27;t have to remain a US citizen, hence absolving the reporting requirements if they went that direction.<p>Or when you have a second citizenship, you can just not tell the US about it, and you can just not tell the foreign bank about your US citizenship. Prosecute that on its own, if you find out.<p>and finally, there are gaps in this reporting framework. FATCA treaty was a broad expansion of a country&#x27;s power, to the limit of our global society in the continuum of history. And its not completely as omnipresent as the American psyche imagined.

Purdue did not invent opioids, what they did is patent a particularly strong formulation, and then work to undermine the cultural taboo in medicine around their use. That last thing was their crime.<p>There isn&#x27;t, at this time, any other way to treat serious pain (in all cases). Opioid prescriptions will continue to be an unfortunately necessary feature of our medical system until we invent painkillers strong&#x2F;good enough to replace them. I say this as someone who was personally addicted to opioids in general and Oxycontin in particular and feel very lucky to have only one dead friend as a result.<p>Opioids can&#x27;t be banned until we can replace them with something equally generally effective. But what we should do is reinstate the taboo around prescribing them, and probably stop offering take home fentanyl prescriptions at all (it&#x27;s still useful for anaesthesia, in hospitals). Perhaps more importantly, I think the cat is kind of out of the bag on prescriptions. I haven&#x27;t been around that world for a long time, but it seems to me like pharmaceuticals aren&#x27;t the primary entrypoint to opioid addiction anymore - people just start with fentanyl.<p>Dealing with fentanyl seems to me to be basically impossible. One kilogram of pure fentanyl is ~2,000,000 doses, for someone without a tolerance. This is impossible to interdict at the border. It is also fully synthetic, with no great choke point on synthesis routes.

What is the realistic way to prescribe opioids routinely and safely?<p>The simple answer is &quot;less and with better monitoring&quot;. The first half of that was the equilibrium that Purdue intentionally shifted in the medical establishment. The cascading effects of that are what caused the modern day opioid crisis. Unfortunately, the modern-day opioid crisis as I understand it is mostly no longer related to pharmaceutical availability. So, while we should improve and lock down that supply chain route, unfortunately I don&#x27;t expect it to make a large dent in the overall problem.<p>&gt; Are there certain formulations that have been or should be removed from the market?<p>Take-home fentanyl is probably unnecessary, but again, I wouldn&#x27;t really expect this to be a silver bullet. The DEA&#x2F;FDA has gotten much tighter on their prescribing rules for powerful opioids, but their doing so has largely coincided with the expansion of the illegal heroin, and then fentanyl markets. It is now too late to fix by choking off supply, because the market has mostly moved outside of the regulatory regime (though we should still do that, to the extent we can).<p>&gt; How do we reinstate the taboo on prescribing them?<p>These answers keep getting worse but we largely already have. We could probably do more, but if you are an MD and you are not &quot;opioids are dangerous actually&quot;-pilled, I think you need to go back to medical school. There was a short period in the mid 2000s where doctors were convinced otherwise by Purdue among others. Doctors who &quot;think otherwise&quot; today are almost without exception just outright criminals.<p>&gt; For EG: I got a vasectomy recently and was told to expect a day or two of pain. I was prescribed a month&#x27;s supply of opioids without a single comment from the doctor on their addictive nature. My understanding is that this is how people get introduced to opioids; the pathway goes &quot;legal scrip -&gt; addiction -&gt; illegal supply -&gt; fentanyl -&gt; death&quot; and that&#x27;s the engine of the epidemic.<p>Overprescription like that (which that definitely is) is bad and unfortunately common. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly how much addiction is caused by that variety, though. Most serious opioid addictions that I am aware of didn&#x27;t get that way from a one time moderate overprescription of things like Vicodin or Percocet. It is possible to get &quot;mildly&quot; addicted from a month&#x27;s supply of that and when you run out you  might have a slightly unpleasant day or two, but not worse than that. If the illicit market wasn&#x27;t there, that 30 day supply would be the end of any binge, and that would be &quot;mostly fine&quot;, as such. That is not an endorsement or to say that it is at all a safe thing to do, but the risk comes primarily from not wanting to quit when you run out, and having other options available.<p>Two things changed with the introduction of Oxycontin:<p>1. It started being prescribed for chronic, not acute pain. This meant that people had permanent, ongoing prescriptions for them. Which meant that people built up a very large tolerance, which led to..<p>2. Oxycontin is pure oxycodone, it is not formulated with an NSAID (like Percocet is). The presence of an NSAID limits the amount you can take before you get sick, and prevents you from (straightforwardly) consuming it via non-oral routes of administration, which is exponentially more addictive.<p>&gt; Should it be legal for the doctor to prescribe pain meds like this? (Or, should it be legal but discouraged? Is there a well-understood way to do this?) If it should be legal, should we expect the epidemic to continue? And if so, is post-bankruptcy Purdue a good thing or a bad thing?<p>Legal but discouraged, definitely. They are an important tool in the treatment of acute pain. They can, more rarely, be an important tool in the treatment of chronic pain (cancer &#x2F; chemotherapy being a good example of a sufficiently serious condition). And finally, they are absolutely worthwhile for palliative care. For these reasons and what is now the magnitude of the illicit market, I don&#x27;t think there is a lot of value in a total restriction.</div><br/><div id="40816826" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816826" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tialaramex</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816090">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815501">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816826">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816826">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Take-home fentanyl is probably unnecessary<p>Nah, a friend and colleague needed fentanyl lollipops at one point.

There are a number of promising addiction treatments in the wings at the moment, in particular Ozempic and the general GLP-1 agonist class.<p>Transitional opioids like Buprenorphine are fine as a detox strategy, and maybe even fine for the medium term, but committing to them for life I think is a mistake (in most cases).<p>&gt; The problems stem from putting unreasonable obstacles between adicts amd their appropriate treatment. Practical legal and financial obstacles, sadistic legal obstacles, and bizarre moral obstacles<p>There is a lot of truth to this. It is, in fact, what I used to say when I used them. And it is and remains true. It is also true that prolonged opioid use is <i>mostly</i> physiologically harmless (overdoses notwithstanding). However, there are psychological elements that come with long term use that these measures do not capture, and are not fully internalized by the transaction costs (or literal costs) associated with obtaining them.<p>&gt; Nineteenth century society managed it with laudinum<p>Ask China why they fought that opium war, and how they feel about such things lately. They are still mad about it.<p>&gt; The Sacklers are, were, parasites profiting from that social malaise and bad things will finally happen to them. But the cause of the malaise is our irrational attitude to drugs<p>Agree on the Sacklers although personally I&#x27;d place more blame on the McKinsey consultants that wrote the original deck that proposed the strategy. I don&#x27;t know how much the Sackler individuals personally made these decisions, but those people certainly did.<p>Re: irrational attitudes to drugs, I agree, but the situation is substantially more nuanced than it might superficially appear. Laudanum did used to be over the counter, as did cocaine among other things. However, these things were not criminalized for no reason - heroin wasn&#x27;t criminalized in the 60s&#x2F;70s anti-hippie craze, or for racist reasons in the 1930s (like marijuana).<p>Heroin was first criminalized for over the counter sale in 1910 - 15 years after Bayer first marketed it. Easily the fastest criminalization of a novel pharmaceutical compound in the history of the world. This is not an accident or a product of some temporary social hysteria. And unfortunately, it was also not criminalized because all of its harms were due to its being illegal.<p>If criminality were the problem we would expect things to get better, not worse, with the introduction of fentanyl which is far cheaper and more readily available. I could be misreading the data, but that does not seem to be working out.</div><br/><div id="40816421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815878">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816283">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816421">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An agree fest ensues<p>I am not advocating pure herion (ironically quite a safe drug aside from addiction) or cocaine powder as modern consumer products.<p>Opium caused upheavals when used as a wedge by Westerners in China, but remember it had been present, and used for millenia in Arabia.<p>The same, roughly, with cocaine and coca<p>It is not a choice between continued sadism or free reign herion and cocaine dealing.<p>We can do better<p>And I think the &quot;psychological elements that come with long term use&quot; is largely confusing cause and effect.<p>From my experience people having drug problems recover when the problems recede.

To reduce things down to being some foreign imposition is to suggest that it could have been any product. But it couldn&#x27;t - only opium has the special properties necessary to become this kind of product. Nobody fought a war over tobacco, or even cocaine.<p>It is also true that Arabia, and even the ancient Greeks (&#x27;land of the lotus eaters&#x27;) were aware of and could obtain Opium. However, I&#x27;d inquire as to how it is that the primary opium growing regions of Arabia are doing lately, or say, ever.<p>It is true that Opium has been available to varying degrees, at various times, in various places without a total social breakdown. However, widespread, sustained, cheap availability of <i>pure</i> Opium without total social breakdown is, as far as I know, unheard of. The over the counter stuff in Europe and the early US were mixed with other things, as in Laudanum. Almost all of high society at the time was addicted anyway, and this was the mild form.<p>The Chinese discovered that they could smoke it, and changing ROA from oral to smoking is a radical step change in addictiveness. I&#x27;m not entirely sure why this didn&#x27;t catch on elsewhere at the time, but the fact of the matter is it didn&#x27;t, and the difference between these things is a difference in kind, not degree.<p>&gt; It is not a choice between continued sadism or free reign herion and cocaine dealing<p>I hope you&#x27;re right! But I don&#x27;t observe anything in the world that would support it, unfortunately. I quit because I was arrested, for instance. I want to be careful about causal meaning here, I didn&#x27;t <i>stay off</i> because I was arrested,  but it was the excipient that proximately caused and also facilitated it. It was a structural break that allowed other things to change around it.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the judicial system is a good way to deal with things - it&#x27;s not. But the credible <i>threat</i> of the judicial system cannot really be done away with here without courting disaster. When dealing with highly physically addictive substances, shaping short term behavior by force is often a necessary ingredient in having any hope of shaping medium or long term behavior via therapy, life circumstance changes, or anything else.</div><br/><div id="40817207" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40817207" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817231">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40817207">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40817207">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; opium growing regions of Arabia<p>The centre of civilisation for centuries</div><br/></div></div><div id="40817231" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40817231" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817207">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40817231">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40817231">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; without courting disaster<p>Too late?<p>weeping...</div><br/></div></div><div id="40817225" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40817225" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816634">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817231">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816283">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40817225">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40817225">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But I don&#x27;t observe anything in the world that would support it,<p>Portugal<p>Legalisation of capabilities across the globe<p>Coca in Bolivia (I am on thin ice, I know too little,  but they elected a coca grower as president)<p>I think there is plenty of evidence that a considered thoughtful approach to drugs is better<p>But the psychopaths and sociopaths that make up the bulk of our governments (here in Aotearoa and in the USA) refuse to pay attention</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40816283" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816283" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jnovek</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815083">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816283">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816283">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“Opioids can&#x27;t be banned until we can replace them with something equally generally effective.”<p>If only doctors took this advice!

I have known hundreds of current and former opioid addicts. I don&#x27;t think I know a single one that was &quot;on-ramped&quot; from Vicodin or Percocet in any truly meaningful sense. It is the case that people almost always use these <i>first</i>. But it is relatively rare to become an opioid addict as the result of a one-off, acute vicodin prescription, per se.<p>&gt; is still mediated by doctors. Until these doctors start losing their licenses for their clear and obvious breaches in their duty of care, this on-ramp will remain open.<p>I hope that is true! It doesn&#x27;t seem like that to me, but I admit to not having carefully studied the data. Casually, there are 1.6 million opioid addictions currently in the US [1]. There were ~50,000 overdose deaths in 2019. That is, 1&#x2F;1600 opioid addicts died in 2019 alone. To a first approximation, 0 people overdose annually from vicodin&#x2F;percocet and other short term acute pain treatments.<p>It would be fairly surprising to me if (much) more than 1&#x2F;1000 strong opioid users (per year) dies from an overdose. If the numbers were substantially higher than this, the epidemic would burn itself out in the population rather quickly. We can infer from this that most active opioid addicts are users of strong opioids, which are basically never prescribed for acute use. Hence, the overwhelming majority of current addicts are users of strong, non-acute opioids.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t be some gateway effect (I do in fact think there is), but it does mean that &quot;the problem&quot; is mostly the presence of the strong opioids, not the Vicodin prescription for your wisdom teeth.<p>I&#x27;d be open to contrary data on the matter, though.<p>&gt; The fact that medical boards allow these doctors to retain their licenses is the core of the issue<p>It is <i>an</i> issue, and we should absolutely try to improve it. It&#x27;s just unlikely to materially dent the larger issue.<p>&gt; I am only aware of a handful of the most obvious, blatant, and egregious pill mill operators being prosecuted. Regular doctors who simply cannot be fucked to care for their patients, and prescribe them pills so they leave their office, have yet to be held accountable.<p>I can personally attest to this being false. It was really quite annoying - I had to find new doctors on a number of occasions as a result, and that was ~15 years ago. Things have gotten much, much tighter on the pharmaceutical side since then. Every doctor who wrote me something was in prison 
or dead (from suicide, in prison) within 2-3 years of the last time I saw them, and I didn&#x27;t even turn them in.<p>It is true that at any given time the Oxycontin prescriptions are power-law distributed, with most of the scripts being written by a small number of doctors.

My understanding is that Purdue pushed hard for marketing, including paying doctors to market for them. This paragraph sums up most of it.<p>&gt; “Purdue admitted that it marketed and sold its dangerous opioid products to healthcare providers, even though it had reason to believe those providers were diverting them to abusers,”  said Rachael A. Honig, First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.  “The company lied to the Drug Enforcement Administration about steps it had taken to prevent such diversion, fraudulently increasing the amount of its products it was permitted to sell. Purdue also paid kickbacks to providers to encourage them to prescribe even more of its products.”<p>Is purdue solely at fault here? Absolutely not. Does it seem that Purdue likely knew what was happening, but put profits above public health? In my opinion, yes.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;opioid-manufacturer-purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-fraud-and-kickback-conspiracies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;opioid-manufacturer-purdue-ph...</a></div><br/><div id="40815778" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40815778" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shawndrost</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814230">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814428">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40815778">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40815778">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand the contents of the link; that judgement prompts my question rather than answering it.<p>The DOJ found that old Purdue&#x27;s problem was illgal marketing, kickbacks, etc. I understand that as a legalistic thing.<p>But as far as human judgement goes: I thought the problem here was opioid addiction, which is continuing to rise in the &quot;new Purdue&quot; regime.

Sure it might be more pragmatic and beneficial for the victims of this particular case to take the deal. But a supreme court can&#x27;t possibly cover all cases, so IMHO it must deal with the law on a higher more principled level. The argument that the bankruptcy court did ok in this case and should be allowed to do this in general is iffy because it fails to take into account various realities of life, e.g. corruption. Limitless authority is for me not a good idea, and I think the decision of the majority makes more sense.<p>&gt; A bankruptcy court’s powers are not limitless and do not endow it with the power to extinguish without their consent claims held by nondebtors (here, the opioid victims) against other nondebtors (here, the Sacklers).<p>But again, this is my regular Joe view on the matter.

It usually comes up when the owner-manager of a company fails to distinguish the corporation as a separate entity with its own purpose and finances, using the company as a personal piggie bank or otherwise going about life as usual and not going through the motions required of corporations under the law.<p>What plaintiffs have alleged against the Sacklers is different, and specific to bankruptcy. Perdue is out of money and is bankrupt, mostly because it caused billions of dollars of damages to hundreds of thousands of people and to the states (which now have to clean up the opioid mess). But not that long before it went bankrupt, it was swimming in money. Perdue didn&#x27;t use those profits to avoid harming people. Nor did it keep the money on hand to pay potential tort claims from the people it was harming. Instead, Perdue&#x27;s officers and board of directors (that is, the Sacklers) approved dividends of billions of dollars to be paid to the company&#x27;s shareholders (that is, again, the Sacklers).<p>The plaintiffs in various lawsuits have alleged that the Sacklers knew that the profits were temporary and the bill would come due, so they purposefully got the money out of the company while the getting was good. More technically: it is alleged that Perdue&#x27;s owners received assets that were transferred from Purdue with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.<p>One thing you absolutely are not allowed to do is use your company to rack up a bunch of debt or liability, take all the assets out of the company, and then declare bankruptcy and expect to get to keep the money. We call that &quot;fraudulent transfer,&quot; and if a court finds that you did fraudulent transfers from your company to your personal bank account you will be ordered to pay that money back to the company (so it can use that money to pay back its creditors and other claimants). The company still exists, it&#x27;s a distinct legal person (so not technically piercing the veil), you just took the company&#x27;s money as if it were a profit when you knew full well the company couldn&#x27;t afford to pay out profits.<p>One big difference between the concepts is this: If Perdue&#x27;s corporate veil were pierced, the Sacklers would be personally on the hook for all the harm their company caused -- they could lose their bank accounts, vacation homes, nice cars, artwork, everything, as if they themselves (rather than &quot;Perdue&quot;) had been the ones going around knowingly fueling a drug addiction crisis.

Some important points that the article here did not emphasize:
1) The Sackler family was not actually a party to this litigation. They came to the table (with most of the settlement money) specifically to get these so called &#x27;3rd party releases&#x27;.
2) Purdue is basically broke. It&#x27;s also an LLC. Thus, in order to go after the Sackler family&#x27;s money, you basically have to claw back money that Purdue paid out to the family over the years. It&#x27;s not impossible to do, but it requires a whole more litigation, the outcome of which is not at all certain.<p>Now, 3rd party releases are a genuinely weird thing: a court ruling that a party that&#x27;s not directly involved in the case is immune from future lawsuits. Partially the reason it went all the way to the supreme court is that there was a circuit split - they were allowed in some circuits, but not others. However, (and this is according to a friend who represented the victims in the settlement), it&#x27;s really unfortunate that THIS is the case where they get struck down. If the Sacklers walk away from the settlement, it makes the victims getting their payout much less certain, and certainly delays that payout by many years.</div><br/><div id="40811911" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40811911" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hinkley</span><span>|</span><a href="#40811069">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40811435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40811548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40811911">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40811911">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My understanding is that Piercing the Corporate Veil has gotten easier over the years.

I am, on many policy issues, quite liberal. I think rich people should pay more taxes, people should drive EVs, etc. But ultimately I care more about the rules--especially the rules about <i>who</i> makes decisions and where power is allocated--than I do about what people or outcomes. I&#x27;d rather see 3C of global warming than administrative agencies operating contrary to the tripartite system of government the Founders designed. I care more about the Constitutional rules for allocating power to states than I do about what citizens of those states might do with that power. Etc.<p>Issues like abortion and environmental laws just happen to map onto particular legal issues as an accident of history. If state-by-state legislation leads to widely legalized abortion, for example, I don&#x27;t think most legal conservatives would support a <i>Roe</i>-like judicial decision ginning up a &quot;right to fetal life&quot; (which actually exists in Germany). If Congress passed environmental laws itself, instead of outsourcing it to an executive agency, I don&#x27;t think most legal conservatives would be looking for ways to second-guess Congress&#x27;s judgment.<p>You actually see this in Europe. The legal system in European countries tends to be pretty boring, because they have more social cohesion and can legislate things according to the rules, rather than hacking up the system. The equivalent of <i>Roe</i>, for example, doesn&#x27;t exist in continental Europe. In an irony, Emmanuel Macron criticized <i>Dobbs</i> when it came down. But France never had anything like <i>Roe</i>. And after <i>Dobbs</i>, France passed a constitutional amendment addressing abortion, which is exactly how legal conservatives would say you should handle the issue!</div><br/><div id="40815472" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40815472" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">relaxing</span><span>|</span><a href="#40811245">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815373">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40815472">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40815472">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;d rather see 3C of global warming than administrative agencies operating contrary to the tripartite system of government the Founders designed.<p>You want to see millions dead to support your political philosophy?</div><br/><div id="40816690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rayiner</span><span>|</span><a href="#40811245">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815472">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816690">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the most redeeming quality of Americans--an inheritance from the British--is that they&#x27;ll jump off a bridge if they&#x27;re told to do so by a court and the required procedures have been followed.

For half a century, conservatives were unified in saying they would overturn <i>Roe</i>, even though--as we have seen subsequently--there was a lot of intra-party conflict about what abortion law should actually be. <i>Dobbs</i> hurt the party that appointed the justices that voted for it.

Where other parts of federal criminal law make an express distinction between bribery (which corrupt official acts) and gratuities (which create the appearance of corruption but can&#x27;t directly influence official acts).<p>This one is probably the most overtly political.

Ironically, in Lawrence v Texas his dissent was basically correct - striking down laws against sodomy <i>was</i> a step towards gay marriage - but the gist of his argument was that gay marriage was such a god awful, horrible, unthinkable thing that any decision that allowed it must be prima facie wrong. He was basically warning &quot;This decision will force us to allow gay marriage&quot; as if, instead of that being a good thing, it was akin to allowing the apocalypse.<p>Scalia also authored the 5-4 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, a major second amendment case that held, for the first time, that individuals had a private right to own guns (not just &quot;a well-regulated militia&quot;). Read up on that case, as tons of &quot;conservative&quot; judicial scholars argued that it was &quot;pulled from thin air&quot; just as much as Roe v Wade was. From the Wikipedia page:<p>&gt; Richard Posner, judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, compares Heller to Roe v. Wade, stating that it created a federal constitutional right that did not previously exist, and he asserts that the originalist method – to which Justice Antonin Scalia claimed to adhere – would have yielded the opposite result of the majority opinion.<p>&gt;&gt; The text of the amendment, whether viewed alone or in light of the concerns that actuated its adoption, creates no right to the private possession of guns for hunting or other sport, or for the defense of person or property. It is doubtful that the amendment could even be thought to require that members of state militias be allowed to keep weapons in their homes, since that would reduce the militias&#x27; effectiveness. Suppose part of a state&#x27;s militia was engaged in combat and needed additional weaponry. Would the militia&#x27;s commander have to collect the weapons from the homes of militiamen who had not been mobilized, as opposed to obtaining them from a storage facility? Since the purpose of the Second Amendment, judging from its language and background, was to assure the effectiveness of state militias, an interpretation that undermined their effectiveness by preventing states from making efficient arrangements for the storage and distribution of military weapons would not make sense.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40814514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40814514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OrigamiPastrami</span><span>|</span><a href="#40812342">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814779">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40814528">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40814514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40814514">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s easy to forget that, while they are political appointees, they have to have fairly long careers as acting judges to even qualify for the appointments.<p>This is objectively false.

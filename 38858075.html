Seek work that you can do via external environments, meaning you don&#x27;t need to be on-site, and don&#x27;t need to have internal access. Ideally you can create an LLC so you can work for yourself.<p>A few examples... 1. Doing compliance-oriented security reviews via cloned systems (e.g. your customer provides you with a non-live copy). 2. Advising on process commitments (e.g. security SLAs, or UML&#x2F;Visio&#x2F;EA diagrams, or declarative configurations). 3.

Presumably most pen testers are working in good faith. But, if there is a malicious actor in their midst, that individual would not disclose any vulnerabilities they intend to exploit, no. What would be the point? That&#x27;s just a really good way to get caught.<p><i>&gt; Then you talk about &quot;discovered and revealed vulnerabilities&quot;.</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s right. While it is theoretically possible for all your pen testers to be working together maliciously, if you are careful in your employment practices you can make this highly unlikely.<p>As such, if your data shows that 100% of all known vulnerabilities were independently discovered by multiple testers, then there is reasonable confidence that any malicious actor&#x27;s failure to disclose a vulnerability will still be reported by someone else.<p>But if that figure is less than 100%, and especially if it is considerably less than 100%, then there is much more doubt cast on another pen tester in your organization&#x27;s ability to find the same vulnerability.

She, and a few other officers, beat the living dogshit out of him. made him look like a racoon. broke her wrist in the process-- and so that&#x27;s felony assault on a police officer WITH GBI. They stuck him one floor above mine. I felt bad, now worse. Dude was a nerd, had no criminal history. he did that for me? I didn&#x27;t deserve it.<p>in any event, we divorced while I was in prison. he got permission to see me there towards the end. took a lot of paperwork, but he did it. so we could have closure in person. got the warden to sign off. had to say a million times over that no, he was not brainwashed. no, I didn&#x27;t shoot him because I love him. it was nothing like that.<p>only reason I got off parole was I had no restitution. and the only reason there was no restitution was because my husband remained adament that I wasn&#x27;t all there. an advanced medical directive was in effect, he was actually my legal caretaker at that point. it was a lot of paperwork, notarized even. annnd it counted for nothing. there were no medical bills to pay-- his insurance covered it, there was nothing but the court costs. He had a clean entry and exit, thank god. else it would have been murder huh. went through his chest, he spent a week in the hospital. made a full recovery.<p>officials reached out to him one last time and asked, and he said something like &quot;you fucks took my husband. eat shit and die.&quot; He said similar when it came to getting a statement from him.

The hiring manager isn&#x27;t the county clerk or a private investigator. He doesn&#x27;t have time to unfuck your fuckary.<p>So when changing your name, pick one from the local obituaries or the name of a former resident of your home. Even better is if you share a name with another known criminal. Your background check will &quot;erroneously&quot; include information about a random dude named Jimmy with a criminal conviction, suggest you are currently incarcerated for manslaughter and DUI, and that you died last year at age 89, but you also died a decade ago at 72. With any luck, he&#x27;ll distrust the results enough to hire you.<p>The other course I&#x27;ve seen is the squeaky-clean route. Adopt the name of an overseas CEO who works in the same industry you do. Then act like an expert in that field without ever explicitly claiming to be that person.

There are terrible employees out there who don&#x27;t break the law. If we&#x27;re so concerned about employers hiring bad employees then state should instead build a centralised database of bad employees and their reason for termination at previous places of work. I&#x27;d argue this would be more effective if we&#x27;re concerned an employer might hire a bad employee.<p>Secondly, making it difficult for those who have committed crimes to get back into the workforce increases their risk of reoffending. Having a good job and a nice life to lose is a great reason to not commit crimes while having nothing to live for is a great excuse to do whatever feels right in the moment.<p>Best of luck op.

there are more applicants than there are positions.  Discrimination is not a bad thing, it’s just discrimination based on built-in traits (race, sex, national origin, etc) that is bad.<p>Discriminating in hiring based on the adult decisions of a human being is not only in-bounds, it is literally the whole of hiring.  Some people studied software, some didn’t.  Some dropped out of high school to start companies, some went to university.<p>This is one of the reasons I think religious discrimination shouldn’t be prohibited in hiring (choice of religion is not a built in trait, but a choice made as an adult).

Due to various undiagnosed mental health issues I ended up with a serious record in the UK - a total of 15 charges, all computer related.<p>Due to the clear lack of malicious intent I didn&#x27;t serve any time, but did get shackled with:  12 months suspended for 12 months;  10 years on the sex offenders register;  7 years sexual harm prevention order; and 5 years of something else I can&#x27;t remember.<p>Every computer I touch - whilst in the UK - should have &quot;monitoring&quot; software installed, which pretty much ruled out any office job, let alone tech.<p>So after 2 failed suicide attempts and a stay in hospital I decided to completely reinvent myself and start from scratch.  Time to hit the big reset button.    Legally I have to reveal my convictions ahead of signing a contract in the UK.  I got frog-marched out of several buildings by security after the interviews were terminated immediately when I revealed my convictions. I was basically unemployable in the UK and decided to leave and never return.  Even after the 10 years is up I am still required to declare &quot;spent convictions&quot; for 5&#x2F;6 years.  This would take me close to my 50th birthday until I no longer have to say anything - 15 years from conviction date.<p>It took 1 year to &quot;create&quot; a new identity, including complete change of name, severing any connection with friends, and faking an employment history.<p>I moved abroad with my new identity and hoped for the best... and so far have had an incredibly successful career (post-conviction), and the one thing which has driven me is being good enough that IF my employer learns of my past, they will weigh up what I offer them vs. what I have done in my past.<p>I remain forever optimistic because _I have to_ .

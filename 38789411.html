There&#x27;s a ton of stuff from the 90s and 2000s like GM trucks, that I strongly suspect will be on the road longer and in greater numbers than stuff 10 years newer. The mid to late 90s and early 2000&#x27;s seems to be the sweet spot where fuel injection and simple electronic ignition, and stuff using older designs (engine&#x27;s, etc.) that had to be built heavier, combined with better metallurgy, better oils, better gas, and so on, meant that the vehicles, when taken care reasonably, would go well past a quarter million miles. There&#x27;s a ton of stuff now, that given much weird crap is on there and how much stuff is done to squeeze every last MPG out (like a lot of GDI setups, auto start&#x2F;stop, transmissions that pull into neutral automatically at a stop, etc.) that I really doubt will make it as far. Even as far as repairability, a 90&#x27;s 4L60E or 4L80 can be repaired way, way more easier by way more people, in an economic fashion than a lot of later transmissions (that you may as well just throw away).

My previous soft was from Ikea. Of course Ikea makes cheap disposable furniture but this sofa, IMO, was not one of those. It was made of real wood, not particle board. It was super well designed. It assembled into 4 parts using slots and a few very large steal bolts and was also easy to disassemble for moving. It&#x27;s entire cover was easy to remove so you could clean stains or easily replace it. Same for the cushions. And it was comfortable. It was under $1000 (note: I know Ikea redesigns things so the same soft today might not be as good as that same model from 2016)<p>Moving overseas I had to buy a new sofa in 2021. Middle of COVID, Ikea didn&#x27;t have any I couldn&#x27;t wait. The sofa I ended up with is the cheapest shit sofa I&#x27;ve ever owned. The materials are clearly inferior.

A pretty basic sofa at C&amp;B is $1,800 - $2,000. In 1990 you could buy a basic Bassett sofa at J.C. Penney for $599 [1] -- $1407 in 2023 dollars. Furniture from Sears and Penney&#x27;s (regardless of whether it was fashionable) was of fine quality, in that it held up for decades. I know because we had furniture like this in our home at the time.<p>So this tells me that the price for a sofa (that is made domestically and not slapped together from particle board, a half inch of foam, and about 4 springs) has gone up by 25-30%. And I think you&#x27;re saying that therefore, this isn&#x27;t an utterly crazy price hike. I&#x27;d agree it&#x27;s modest.<p>Thing is, I think what&#x27;s changed is demographics. In 1990, a LOT of people bought furniture at a department store or furniture store. They could afford it, but also here&#x27;s the interesting part: It was much more rare then to find a $250 sofa. If that was your budget, you just bought a used good sofa and you probably got a better product. When super cheap everything appeared in the late 90s, it drove out the good manufactured goods, and many of the stores that <i>sold</i> those good items. People felt like buying the quality of things they used to buy would be extravagant, since they could buy an IKEA or Walmart version for less than half, and also, many families started to be worse off financially than their parents&#x27; generation had been, adding to their feelings of frugality. Unfortunately, this crap is so shoddy in most cases that it&#x27;s actually more expensive when you factor in its lifetime.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christmas.musetechnical.com&#x2F;ShowCatalogPage&#x2F;1990-JCPenney-Fall-Winter-Catalog&#x2F;1054" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christmas.musetechnical.com&#x2F;ShowCatalogPage&#x2F;1990-JCP...</a><p>* Some present-day comparisons:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jcpenney.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;signature-design-by-ashley-camila-sofa&#x2F;ppr5007255040?pTmplType=regular&amp;deptId=dept20000011&amp;catId=cat1002460008" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jcpenney.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;signature-design-by-ashley-camila...</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;paerup-sofa-gunnared-beige-s29389463&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;paerup-sofa-gunnared-beige-s293...</a></div><br/><div id="38791312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38791312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">volkl48</span><span>|</span><a href="#38789802">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38790381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38791031">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38791312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38791312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bedbugs had been suppressed to the point that you were very unlikely to ever encounter them 30-50 years ago.

When that house was built - there was no electricity. That had been added later - and you could still see where channels had been hewn into the wall to put in cables and later plastered over again.<p>But everything electrical in that house was repairable to a degree that seems unimaginable today.<p>For example, every single power plug had screws. If you removed those, it would come apart in two halves, to reveal another set of screws that held the cable in. If you undid those screws, you could easily shorten or replace the cable - in case it was broken. There was no glue, no solder, and most of the plugs had even metal inserts for the screws to go into.<p>The appliances on the other end of the cables were just as easy to take apart and put back together. And their insides were (mostly) free of proprietary parts - almost everything was &quot;standard&quot; stuff, that you could get replacements for, from a supplier of your own choice.<p>Many of those appliances still worked perfectly fine, after my grandparents had died, and the house had been torn down. That doesn&#x27;t mean they never broke - but if they did, my grandpa was able to easily fix them himself. And if he could not fix something, he still was able to salvage it for parts that then could be used to fix other things.</div><br/><div id="38790864" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38790864" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mijamo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38790750">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38789668">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38790864">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38790864">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I do not know where you are from but the description of the plugs basically match the ones still installed in France (although many don&#x27;t require screws because they have built it fixations that just &quot;click&quot;), and I have never seen one that requires glue or soldering. Appliance life expectancy has also gone way up statistically, just like cars, although people often complain about the complexity of both. Most washing machines are pretty easy to fix for the parts that do break for instance. Of course if you get a dead motherboard it is not easy to fix, but usually wear and tear happens more on the mechanical pieces that are well documented and also now full of tutorials on how to change them on the internet.
My parents and grandparents never dared doing anything on their appliances because nobody taught them to.

Shrinkflation is the quintessential symptom of the problem, from the perspective of the consumer. But it&#x27;s not just &quot;how do we raise the price per pound without raising the price per unit.&quot;<p>Another angle to view this from is that saving money is jot worthwhile. People who get paid in dollars need to spend them quickly, so on offer around them is a plethora of goods and services that they can spend it on. Nobody saves for stuff so that stuff better be cheap, I&#x27;m sure the ideal price for an item is some function of the median weekly paycheck and apartment rent.<p>Viewed from yet another angle (and IMO a more informative one if you want to get at what exactly is going on here objectively) you see that inflation has a general corrosive effect on value and quality. The velocity of money increases, and the value of holding money decreases the longer it is held. So businesses trying to maximize profit have to go from getting people to spend their money to getting their money <i>first.</i> They have to have fast turnaround time for that capital. They have to pump out as many units as they can as fast as they can, those units have to degrade quicker than the money loses value or they can&#x27;t make a profit. This creates a culture of unscrupulousness, the phenomenon compounds and speeds up over a few generations.

A few years ago I bought a Samsung refrigerator. It came with a big &quot;10 year warranty&quot; sticker. After a couple of years or so, one day it stopped cooling. I thought what a piece of crap, but at least it had a warranty. I found out, over the phone, that the 10 year warranty was only for the compressor. Still, I was lucky because it was the compressor that had gone bad. But there was more fine print in the 10-year warranty: it only covered the compressor and only the price of the part. In other words, I had to pay for the technician to come to my house and replace the part. Almost 200 dollars for a refrigerator that had cost 800 and was supposedly under warranty.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38789722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38789722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattlondon</span><span>|</span><a href="#38790773">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38789644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38789722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38789722">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have sort of found this - some time ago (10 years maybe?) the &quot;average&quot; and unresearched purchase was &quot;average quality&quot;.

Amazon is literally flooded with totally random brand named (all weirdly uppercase?  EEVYUI, XAATYE, WURIHT  etc) trash which 9 times out of 10 (at least) will be awful shite.

With a little research and accepting that quality costs and so not buying the cheapest&#x2F;second-cheapeat models we have appliances&#x2F;things that have lasted many years - washing machines, dishwashers, coffee grinders, fridges, cars etc. Some of these we have replaced for other reasons like changing needs or wanting new features (e.g. we needed a dishwasher that dried plastic things since kids stuff is all plastic - the old machine was perfectly fine when we got rid of it and yea, no one wanted it).<p>It is somewhat galling to think &quot;wow why am I paying Â£600 for a dishwasher when I can get one for Â£250!?&quot; but then Â£600 only seems expensive <i>because</i> of the crappy Â£250 one that will only last a month or two past the 12 month warranty.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38789644" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38789644" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adamhorne</span><span>|</span><a href="#38789722">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38791158">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38789644">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38789644">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find this pretty useful: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;BuyItForLife&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;BuyItForLife&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38791158" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38791158" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nazgulnarsil</span><span>|</span><a href="#38789644">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38791143">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38791158">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38791158">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">it&#x27;s partially driven by scale.

I used my LG washing machine for ~12-13 years before replacing it, same for my AC (&gt;15 years)&#x2F;fridge (~15 years) etc. Now I have had few bad apples, laptop that was junk in 2 years. AC that kept giving trouble.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38790223" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38790223" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kristjansson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38790677">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38789776">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38790223">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38790223">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most of the stuff inside Target would compare unfavorably to cake simulacra made for Netflix to put on television.<p>This isnât a bad thing!

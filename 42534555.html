You don&#x27;t want to have that cool new rocket you developed dependent on a satellite constellation that gets delayed.  So you have a rocket that would be easier to fill with a number of small to medium sized satellites to LEO or (fewer) to GEO.<p>And like other people on the thread have commented, it seems BO is a decade behind SpaceX, so... yeah... a big rocket that competes with Starship is pretty risky for BO.<p>And yes, I understand that BO is independent from Amazon, but from what I&#x27;ve seen this is just so they can execute on a schedule that isn&#x27;t determined by AMZN&#x27;s board of directors.  They seem pretty closely related, just from talking with Kuiper, GSaaS and BO engineers.<p>I don&#x27;t work for any of the above mentioned companies and have no insider information.  YMMV.

Though admittedly, we have to depend on BO&#x27;s predictions for per-kg launch costs, and those may be a lot higher for the first few missions and gradually ease off.<p>Google&#x27;s AI tells me the current costs for a Starship launch is somewhere between $100m and $2b.  Wikipedia says a Falcon 9 costs about $50m and can lift about 20t to LEO.  I see a blurb that says Musk says Starship launches will get down to $10m each.  But... that seems like an &quot;asperational statement.&quot;  He also said Full Self Driving Mode would be available in 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2025.  Not trying to take away from the absolutely cool stuff his companies have done, but it seems like it will be a while before it costs $10m to launch a Starship.<p>This link from 2 years ago estimates a New Glenn launch costing $68m.  I have no idea how accurate that number is.

The Google AI picked that up and included it in its answer.  There is a lot of range between 100m and 2b, which implies there&#x27;s a lot of data getting thrown around and we don&#x27;t have good numbers.<p>If observing that we don&#x27;t have good numbers is arguing in bad faith... I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.<p>Musk at some point said $10m for a Starship launch.  I think I found a reference for that in a CNBC interview... I&#x27;ll look it up later.  But my point is... It is unlikely that Starship launches are $10m RIGHT NOW.  But sure... maybe they will be in the future.  I take Elon with a grain of salt because of his comments regarding Full Self-Driving Mode and Robo-Taxi deployment dates.<p>I said we should not compare New Glenn estimated launch costs RIGHT NOW with Elon&#x27;s asperational price target of $10m.  We should compare Starship&#x27;s cost per kg to LEO RIGHT NOW with New Glenn&#x27;s estimated cost per kg to LEO RIGHT NOW.  Or we could compare them at a particular point in the project history.  We could compare per-kg costs at first launch or estimated per-kg costs at the 10th launch.<p>Both companies are saying they want to do a lot of launches, so we&#x27;ll eventually have MUCH better data.<p>I&#x27;m suggesting we compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges and not apples to oranges.<p>At the current moment, all Starship launches have been fully disposable (though yes, one booster was caught by the chopsticks so it&#x27;s probably more accurate to say the whole system is about 1&#x2F;12th re-usable.)  At this point in the program, you have to pay for each vehicle that lands or crashes in the water.  I agree with you when you say &quot;100m is more accurate for a fully disposable launch.&quot;  Starship is currently more disposable than it is reusable.<p>When SpaceX re-uses the boosters and the Starships, then it will not be fully disposable and the price per launch will go down.  We are not at that point at the moment.  You can tell this because a number of boosters and starships have fallen into the ocean, some crashing, some coming to a controlled stop just over the ocean and then falling over.<p>But the important part here is that the equipment that wasn&#x27;t caught by the chopsticks doesn&#x27;t get to be re-used.  So if you want to do another launch, you have to build new equipment.  That new equipment will cost money.<p>So if the current, mostly non-reusable Starship launches cost $100m a pop, that&#x27;s after several launches.  Even though we have someone estimating the first couple of New Glenn launches cost $68m, let&#x27;s wait until it has 6 launches and THEN compare costs.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42563879" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42563879" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">numpad0</span><span>|</span><a href="#42563521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563777">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42563879">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42563879">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is Starship really not following the exact step of N-1 &amp;&amp; VentureStar?</div><br/><div id="42564106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42564106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceejayoz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42563521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563879">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42564106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42564106">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Computers and materials came a long way since the N1, as Starship’s successful tests can attest to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42563820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42563820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bpodgursky</span><span>|</span><a href="#42563521">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563879">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42563820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42563820">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but if it works, there&#x27;s still going to be demand for other mission profiles that it won&#x27;t make sense to send on Starship<p>I&#x27;m rooting for any and all US launch providers to succeed, but I don&#x27;t think this is true.

I struck up a conversation w&#x2F; Rob Meyerson @ a conference and told him what I was working on (mostly comms &#x2F; ground station work, but with a tiny bit of GNC test infrastructure.)  I mean, I&#x27;m not God&#x27;s gift to rocket scientists, but...  I was pretty heavily recruited by them but was working at Amazon and didn&#x27;t want to leave, then spent some time nursing a family member through cancer treatments.  Finally I&#x27;m ready to talk to them and I start with back-channel chats to make sure they still have open reqs.  They do so I informally talk about specific things I&#x27;ve done and what I might do at BO.  Finally I put my resume together and submit it to the hiring manager I had been talking about, emphasizing the bits he said he was interested in.  15 minutes later I&#x27;m rejected for the position they had been recruiting me for.<p>I mean... I&#x27;m not a SUPER rocket engineer, but I&#x27;m pretty solid for the things I did work on.  I&#x27;ve slogged through design meetings where I had to analyze protocol specs and make sure we agree&#x27;d on details, wrote code, wrote A LOT of tests.  I mean, I&#x27;m solid.  The only thing I can think is I don&#x27;t have a Ph.D., but that DEFINITELY wasn&#x27;t a requirement when Bob was running the shop.<p>Folk have told me it&#x27;s evolved into something much more like Amazon where each team optimizes it&#x27;s tiny bit and teams communicate only via APIs and the only opportunity you get to optimize complete functional or value chains is when something breaks.<p>Just seems a bit weird they went from &quot;we&#x27;re 10 guys in a hangar&quot; to &quot;we&#x27;ve re-implemented Amazon&#x27;s small-team&#x2F;local optimization religion&quot; in less than 10 years and with less than 1&#x2F;30-th of the number of engineers.<p>I wish them the best.  I think SpaceX really needs some decent competition to focus their collective minds.  But... they&#x27;ve gone weird.<p>I&#x27;m probably too senior and too &quot;weird&quot; to them to get hired there, but I absolutely encourage young engineers interested in an intense experience to check out their jobs page.</div><br/><div id="42564547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42564547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jach</span><span>|</span><a href="#42564123">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42564547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42564547">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s several funny stories of their hiring oddities on HN going back at least 10 years...

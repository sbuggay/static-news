Networking (friend of friends, friend of customers, etc). Leverage your network to find more customers.<p>2. The &quot;Long Game&quot; (SEO, word of mouth, etc). This is where I get most of my customers.<p>I&#x27;d say focus on the long game from day one (blog posts, good marketing pages, etc).

Well it will, but its much harder to stand out from the crowd.<p>Some things don&#x27;t change though. You need to find customers before you find (ie build) product. Ideally you get a deposit before you start writing. Getting customers is harder than writing code, so do that first.<p>Finding customers is hard. You need to get close enough to see their pain. You need to make that pain go away. It&#x27;s seldom as easy as you expect to make pain go away (the devil is in the details.)<p>The good news is that it is possible. And it&#x27;s hard enough that it keeps the competition away.

You need to find customers before you find (ie build) product. Ideally you get a deposit before you start writing. Getting customers is harder than writing code, so do that first.<p>To add to this, there&#x27;s always a catch 22 problem - how can I show something to customers to sell to, when I don&#x27;t even have a product to sell? It&#x27;s expected in a sales meeting or often any meeting, that you have a demo that would show your product concept for them.<p>I can&#x27;t state this enough, but literally build on the shoulders of giants. Build on existing tools, and I don&#x27;t mean open source, but existing products. Best advice I got from watching one of those AI fad-chasing YouTubers. Is it an online store idea? Build on Shopify first. Is it a chatbot? Use KoreAI or DialogCX. Is it a CRUD app? Use Glide + Google Sheets. Customer Service? Maybe they just need a Hubspot&#x2F;Zendesk with some custom integrations.<p>Most customers are looking to buy a functionality, not a &quot;product&quot; . Oftentimes your MVP will be enough to carry them for a long time. You wouldn&#x27;t even need to write a single line of code yourself for quite a bit of time.<p>Like you said, the hard part is actually meeting the potential prospect and ensuring that they will pay you for the product. In my (very limited) experience, I&#x27;ve had 60k-employee billion dollar companies outright refuse to buy (instead hiring 2000 underpaid fresh graduates in India to build a worse product), while a 250-employee million dollar company being super-enthusiastic about paying a premium price for it (even though they have their own dev team). If I had gone by the views of the billion dollar company, I wouldn&#x27;t have found a market niche for my product, but fortunately I stubbed my toe (literally!) and found the actual customer instead.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42577241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42577241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mleonhard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42561198">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42558603">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42577241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42577241">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Founding Sales book is a good resource.

It&#x27;s worth spending some money initially (if you can) because your primary goal is to reach Step 2.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42566622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42566622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">softwaredoug</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583063">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42562508">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42566622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42566622">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just listen and help people with your expertise. Be a good advisor. Focus your efforts on finding a good fit for their needs, not selling them something. Talk positively about all the options on the market and the pros &#x2F; cons. Why you’re a good fit or not for them. Make referrals to the “competition”. It’s not a zero sum game.<p>The trust you earn by trying to genuinely be of service to the market pays back dividends. Not in an easily quantifiable RoI. But eventually it will.<p>The other bit of advice is you need to set some boundaries and expectations for working together. This includes closing the sale (we need contract back by X date or we can’t work together) and when executing &#x2F; serving them (we can’t exceed this limit, we need payment by Y or service will be paused). Hold yourself to being disciplined and not people pleasing. You’ll regret the latter usually. Sometimes the best thing you can do is NOT close the deal.<p>Don’t undersell yourself. Set a price point where half of your inbound is unable to work with you. Eliminate bad fits early.<p>As a solo entrepreneur your time is extremely limited. So boundaries and setting a good price point are very important so people don’t waste your time.<p>And because you’re probably still looking for PmF these trusting relationships turn your potential customers into advisors. Treat your best customers advice as sacrosanct. You’ll find a niche in partnership with them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42562508" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42562508" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mud_dauber</span><span>|</span><a href="#42566622">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42562346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42562508">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42562508">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m hesitant to simply say “read this”, but please consider The Mom Test.

I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve explained a person&#x27;s product to them and they have a mini epiphany as they never saw it that way before.<p>In my experience, many product makers who describe themselves as being bad at sales just can&#x27;t get their head out of their own view point. So even speaking to a person who is just marginally above average at sales and describes it as an outsider can really shift their way of thinking. The customer may not use the product in the exact way you think they will when you made it. Having the benefit of seeing how others see your product will put you on the same footing when you pitch it to them.<p>Also, find a way of presenting that fits your personality. I&#x27;m pretty mater of fact and my sales pitch has always been sort like &quot;we have some cool stuff for sale, you use some of the exact kind of stuff we sell, let&#x27;s talk about whether our stuff would be good for you.&quot; Then I just ask them questions. Sales people have the (deserved) stereotype of blathering on about their product or service and being tone deaf to whether it&#x27;s a good fit or not. I ask and I ask. People will talk about themselves quite a bit and in my mind, I am taking notes on what may be a good fit for them and what might not be.<p>Eventually, they&#x27;ve run out of things to talk about and I&#x27;ll start talking about what I think they should look  at and why. That brings me around to another thing--fitting in. I have no problem telling people if one of our offerings is not something they should consider. I don&#x27;t want to force something on someone, when they are smart enough to know it isn&#x27;t right for them. Cajoling someone into a sale that isn&#x27;t a great fit just leads to problems after the sale, then I&#x27;m putting out fire with them when I should be selling to others. Not only does it build trust with the customer to pass on things, but it&#x27;s just the right thing to do.<p>Think of yourself not as a salesperson, but as a problem solver. If they have a business problem your product can solve, tell them.<p>Good luck and I hope this helps!</div><br/></div></div><div id="42560352" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42560352" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wallstprog</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583223">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42563403">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42560352">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42560352">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Michael Porter&#x27;s books on marketing (esp. &quot;Competitive Strategy&quot;) are well-regarded.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42563403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42563403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">markus_zhang</span><span>|</span><a href="#42560352">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42563403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42563403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used to work as a stock broker and it helped tremendously with my soft skills.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42583481" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583481" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jongjong</span><span>|</span><a href="#42563403">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583481">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583481">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I find this to be an impossible problem because everything that any consumer could possibly want already exists. In fact, there are too many things and wealthy people are literally going insane trying to absorb the enormous supply and range of goods and services that are available to them. Sales is basically a zero-sum game of one useless product or service stealing market share from another useless product or service.<p>The only real problem which exists in society is the problem that the system itself prevents us from solving. The problem of allowing people to obtain money to buy the damn stuff that is being produced and whose production could be easily scaled up at will and there is nothing save climate change and other doom narratives getting in the way of massively scaling up production and automating everything. Letting the pie grow as big as is required to satisfy everyone. Ask just about anyone on the  street what they need and if they&#x27;re honest, 99% of them will tell you that they need more money to buy the stuff that already exists. The government could essentially give free land and free money (UBI) to everyone, new cities would be built and the system would expand and decentralize outward, creating an abundance of opportunities.<p>How do you solve the problem of helping people to get more money when the entire monetary system is designed to concentrate wealth, to take away opportunities and wealth from the masses. The only solutions to the most important problem in society are political. There are no business solutions for this problem within the current political framework.<p>There is no incentive to actually automate anything (beyond the point when it satisfies only the elite) when the masses are systematically broke and desperate for money. People will always be as cheap as machines. Slavery exists on the periphery and will grow in the current system. It will come down to the cost of food for a slave or electricity for a machine... However, the slave can produce their own food in the same way that an intelligent machine could produce its own electricity. The net cost is 0 in both cases. Slavery is more achievable, even today.<p>Now if you&#x27;re interested in ways to make money without solving the only problem that matters, then you need to basically come up with a solution to make the problem worse; which helps concentrate the money faster, more surveillance, more control, more plausible deniability, more dulling of the senses, more inequality, more suffering... Basically anything that helps to prevent political change. Nothing else pays in the current political framework besides protecting the current political framework.</div><br/><div id="42583857" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583857" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kilpikaarna</span><span>|</span><a href="#42583481">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42583571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583857">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583857">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, I feel this!

A product which is low capital to build is actually extremely high capital to sell because you need an enormous marketing budget to even get one real user to try your product.

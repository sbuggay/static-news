The inverse is also true: removing an established LVT carries a significant upside for the affected landowners. Property that had been acquired for cheap under a LVT would be freed of its shackles and allowed to appreciate again. Some of this would be immediate, as thousands of dollars in taxes shift away from land and back onto labour, enterprise, and commerce, and some of it would be gradual as people resume buying land because land value always goes up (which causes land values to go up). This creates a powerful incentive to undo any progress that a LVT campaign might accomplish.<p>I doubt that anything short of a revolution would be able to overpower the wealthy landowning class who like their unearned rents and inflated asset values very much thank you, but you don&#x27;t just need to beat them once, you need to be able to hold their political, economic, and intellectual influence at bay permanently or we end up right back where we started in a matter of years.</div><br/><div id="40678218" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40678218" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">failuser</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677483">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40678218">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40678218">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You need to fight for keeping any accomplishments you’ve got.

I&#x27;ve got gold bars where I allegedly am making a 100-and-something% return and that just flies in the face of the inert reality of the metal itself. The tax is markedly unfair, anyone trying to be a responsible saver ends up paying much more of their income in tax than someone who just spends it on the day and it effectively becomes a wealth tax that stops anyone in the middle class moving up over time. Moving wealth between assets is catastrophic to your financial health once CGT is a factor.<p>There are a bunch of quirky distortions in the tax system. CGT might even be one of the contributing factors to why people don&#x27;t tend to have savings (although the biggest factor is probably psychology). Rationally speaking saving is quite an inefficient use of money if you end up paying CGT.</div><br/><div id="40678823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40678823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cipheredStones</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677483">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678674">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40678823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40678823">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 1) Shares don&#x27;t do very much on their own, so there isn&#x27;t really a problem with that.

But most of the demand isn&#x27;t for land in particular, it&#x27;s for indoor space. If you have LVT and don&#x27;t have density restrictions -- or just don&#x27;t have density restrictions regardless of LVT -- then people are going to build until the cost of indoor space falls to the construction cost. Then land values will be low because it&#x27;s being used efficiently, and there is a de facto ceiling on the price -- if you want to add 100 stories of new space and land is dirt cheap then you might build a hundred single-story buildings, but if land gets even slightly more expensive than that you can just build twenty 5-story buildings instead, which is what people would do rather than paying for five times more land unless it&#x27;s prohibited.<p>LVT increases this incentive even more, because not only would you have to pay for more land, you would have to pay the LVT on more land, so now it makes sense to build ten or twenty story buildings. Meanwhile if you&#x27;re <i>not</i> going to build a ten or twenty story building (or in a place like NYC, a hundred story building), holding onto an underutilized lot will cost more than it&#x27;s worth, so the land values become negligible. This ignoring the overall premise of LVT which is that the tax should be equal to the land value, so even if land values <i>were</i> high, the tax would just offset them and zero them out -- until the high tax incentivized even more construction.<p>But there is a different reason the argument doesn&#x27;t apply to this -- or to any other tax. Governments have budgets. If they currently get money from a tax, and you propose to get rid of the tax, and your proposal is to <i>cut spending</i>, the people currently receiving the money (often politically connected corrupt industries or government unions) will fight you. If you propose to get rid of the tax without cutting spending by instituting or raising some other tax, the people you propose to tax instead will fight you. The status quo is sticky.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40678570" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40678570" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HDThoreaun</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677483">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677574">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678815">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40678570">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40678570">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Done right land is worthless under land value tax.

The whole point of Decentraland, which is a crypto metaverse, was to make land prices go up. They didn&#x27;t. Decentraland is boring and nobody goes there. But it does work, and it&#x27;s up and running all the time. There are other crypto metaverses. Most of them never got beyond the hand-waving stage or the occasional demo of a small virtual world, but that didn&#x27;t stop them from trying to sell overpriced land. Despite all the noise from the metaverse crowd, few of them got very far on implementation.<p>We are in agreement. I thought the crypto metaverses were stupid and said so loudly at the time and predicted they would fail for many reasons; the point about land speculation with crypto games is that charging for the right to upload UGC is literally the dumbest idea in the world.<p>The difference between a crypto metaverse and the real world is you can opt out of existing in any individual virtual world.

And you might notice states with very high property taxes (an imperfect tax to be sure, but one that definitely puts a higher holding cost on land, despite the inefficient tax on buildings).<p>Tell me, is housing more affordable in states with high property taxes, or in states with very low property taxes?</div><br/><div id="40677551" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677551" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Arch485</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677341">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677551">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677551">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To answer your last question: it depends!<p>Cranking up property tax or land tax still sucks. Sure, maybe you can buy land now, but what if you want to live on it? Your house doesn&#x27;t earn you income (i.e. what you build on your land is not &quot;productive&quot;), so you&#x27;re stuck paying taxes on something that doesn&#x27;t give you any fiscal value.<p>In practice, this doesn&#x27;t help housing crises very much, but it _does_ increase wealth disparity! People who could previously afford a home now have to sell their property and either rent from somewhere, or buy a cheaper, presumably worse property.<p>The increased property taxes also get passed from landlord to renter, up to what the market will bear. This is also bad, because it significantly increases the cost of living.<p>Overall, there&#x27;s no direct relationship between more expensive&#x2F;less expensive housing and whether land&#x2F;property is taxed. It&#x27;s usually a challenge of efficient zoning etc.<p>Now, one alternative that I&#x27;m interested in would be an &quot;surplus land tax&quot;, i.e., if you own a property for the purposes of living on it, there is minimal or no taxation. Then if you buy more property for some reason, the tax is significantly higher (why do you, as an individual, need more land?). This discourages people from owning a surplus of land, while (hopefully) avoiding the increase in wealth disparity. If you want land for the purpose of a business, the revenue from the business should ideally cover any applicable land taxes.</div><br/><div id="40677669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hibikir</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677669">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The tax doesn&#x27;t really increase wealth disparity, as your example with no tax requires someone being able to buy the land in the first place. If the land is still very desirable, the person that owns a very well located plot is extremely wealthy by investing when it was cheap, or having a lot of money. The wealth disparity is still there, just with a different winner.<p>Your surplus idea has significant problems: First, good luck if you aren&#x27;t owning a single family home, as then you aren&#x27;t tax free. Second, that you can still massively speculate by buying the highest valued land you can, in the largest plot possible, and then have the best leverage. So prices of land don&#x27;t go down, but way up! And that&#x27;s while the land is also less useful to neighbors, as a large plot with a house in it is far worse than, say, a corner store, a park, or an office. So you are rewarding the land use that is the lowest value to neighbors, while theoretically calling that affordability.<p>If you want more desirable land to be available to more people, the only sensible alternative is to make more people be able to use it at a time: Anything else is just picking a different favorite way to decide who gets to use it&#x2F;buy it. It also makes the land more useful in general: The bay area would be much lower balue than it is now if it was occupied by a sole proprietor who is the only one traversing its current streets and buildings.</div><br/><div id="40677923" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677923" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">floating-io</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677669">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677445">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677923">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677923">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The tax doesn&#x27;t really increase wealth disparity[...]<p>Counterpoint:<p>Where I live the land values have, at minimum, 4x&#x27;ed in the last couple of decades.

Option 2, reintroduce artificial scarcity, e.g. ban tall buildings so land becomes artificially scarce again. But now you&#x27;re back to inefficient land use and thwarting the ostensible benefit of the tax.<p>Or Option 3, fund the government some other way. Which removes the government&#x27;s perverse incentive to create artificial scarcity of land to maximize their tax revenue. But then why not just start there?

If the need is an average of 1.2 stories, why would developers build until there is 2.5 stories? Yes, with a 10 story building you pay less LVT per apartment, but if nobody buys or rents those apartments, it&#x27;s still cheaper to build a, say, 3 story building.

So you&#x27;ll find an equilibrium point where somebody maybe wants to pay a higher LVT in order to live in a single-family home on their own lot, somebody else prefers a bit roomier apartments in a 4-story building instead of shoebox apartments in that 50-story building etc.<p>And likely the developer of the 50-story building will then make a huge loss, because building such an extremely tall building is very expensive, and tends to make sense only where land prices and demand are huge, not in a place where the requirement is an average 1.2 stories.<p>&gt; Or Option 3, fund the government some other way.

If the need is an average of 1.2 stories, why would developers build until there is 2.5 stories?<p>Because LVT doesn&#x27;t scale with buildings.<p>Suppose you already have enough housing. More than enough, even. There is a 25% vacancy rate. Units are renting for $2000&#x2F;month, half what they were before LVT. Of that, $1000 is the amortized construction cost and other upkeep. For a 1-story building, there is also another $1000&#x2F;unit&#x2F;month in LVT. They&#x27;re already losing money because 25% of their units are vacant and they&#x27;d need a 0% vacancy rate just to break even. But they also lose money by renting for any less than $2000&#x2F;month, so they&#x27;re resistant to lowering rents below that because a large proportion of the units are the existing single-story housing stock.<p>But the same LVT is only $200&#x2F;unit&#x2F;month for a 5-story building and $100 for a 10-story building. The landlord with a 10-story building is still turning a decent profit even with 25% of the units empty. So landlords with a 1-story building start putting up 10-story buildings even though there is already oversupply because they go from losing money to making some, and the vacancy rate increases even more.<p>There will be an equilibrium where they stop, but by then the vacancy rate could be arbitrarily high depending on how high the LVT is relative to construction costs.<p>&gt; The way I understand it, the LVT is &#x27;automatically&#x27; set by the land values, hence the LVT name. Of course the government can play with what percentage of the land value the tax is set to, but presumably it would be very unproductive to set it higher than the rate of return of that land in the first place. So even a &#x27;maximal&#x27; LVT would be capped (assuming basic economic saneness on the behalf of the government).<p>This is the issue. Land values become quite meager without artificial scarcity in housing, and then the government doesn&#x27;t receive much revenue from the tax. Since the government wants tax revenue, they now have a perverse incentive to bring about artificial scarcity in housing. Which is the same incentive they have now with property tax, but the premise of LVT is that they&#x27;re not going to act on it.<p>&gt; So if somebody builds a 50-story building, then there is suddenly an oversupply of housing, and as result land values drop, and thus the LVT a land owner needs to pay drops as well.<p>For which the endgame is that land values fall to be level with the ground, and the government either charges more than the land value in tax, or enacts policies to bring about artificial scarcity to increase the land value, or has negligible tax revenue.<p>&gt; And likely the developer of the 50-story building will then make a huge loss, because building such an extremely tall building is very expensive, and tends to make sense only where land prices and demand are huge, not in a place where the requirement is an average 1.2 stories.<p>Very tall buildings are very expensive (but also contain a very large number of units to rent out). Medium buildings aren&#x27;t all that expensive per unit. If you only need 1.2 stories on average and then fill half the city with 5-story buildings, you&#x27;d have no scarcity of housing without anybody ever building a 50-story building.<p>If you&#x27;re in a place like NYC the developer of the 50-story building is making a lot more money than the developer of a 10-story building notwithstanding the higher construction costs because they&#x27;re paying five times less LVT.<p>&gt; Well, that&#x27;s the crux isn&#x27;t it: What is &#x27;some other way&#x27;? (Almost) all taxes cause economic inefficiency in some way.<p>In general a broad-based tax so that the rate can be lower and minimize the distortionary effect, e.g. VAT.<p>&gt; LVT, proponents claim, is almost unique in not causing any deadweight loss because the supply of land is fixed. So from an economic efficiency point of view, it seems LVT is the (or at least, among the) least bad tax.<p>A head tax also has no deadweight loss but that&#x27;s not the only criteria. Moreover, if LVT causes land values to go down and then generates negligible revenue, this is a problem unless you find it convenient for the government to have negligible revenue.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40677329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">angled</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677301">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677555">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677329">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Canberra, ACT has it, too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revenue.act.gov.au&#x2F;land-tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revenue.act.gov.au&#x2F;land-tax</a></div><br/><div id="40677381" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677381" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fblp</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677329">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677381">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677381">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Actually all Australian states and the ACT have land taxes in lieu of property taxes

Compared to them LVTs have distinct advantages in not encourage run down buildings or empty lots (e.g. car parking lots).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40677111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qup</span><span>|</span><a href="#40678113">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677111">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you want to see the extents to which this drives people, just check out this video (warning, language):<p>What video?</div><br/><div id="40677161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">forbiddenlake</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From the original post, it&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=onrX5ZURtek" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=onrX5ZURtek</a><p>Since the post was written, FFXIV has fully switched to a lottery system[1], so at least one doesn&#x27;t have to click a placard for hours, but land is still scarce on certain worlds.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;na.finalfantasyxiv.com&#x2F;lodestone&#x2F;playguide&#x2F;contentsguide&#x2F;housing_land&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;na.finalfantasyxiv.com&#x2F;lodestone&#x2F;playguide&#x2F;contentsg...</a> under &quot;Lottery System&quot; - all worlds currently use this method</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40677557" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677557" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">westurner</span><span>|</span><a href="#40677111">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40678014">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677557">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677557">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Land Crisis</i> [on the internet, too]<p>Land Value Tax: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax</a><p>Virtual economies: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtual_economies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtual_economies</a><p>Category:Virtual economies:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Virtual_economies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Virtual_economies</a><p>Gold farming &gt; Secondary effects on in-game economy; inflation,:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gold_farming#Secondary_effects_on_in-game_economy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gold_farming#Secondary_effects...</a><p>WSE: World Stock Exchange (2007-2008) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_Stock_Exchange" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_Stock_Exchange</a><p>The opportunity costs of spending GPU hours on various alternatives.<p>Economy of Second Life &gt; Monetary policy:

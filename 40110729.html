C and C++ are still unfortunately prevalent, but there are at least quite a few systems programming alternatives, and they&#x27;re gaining ground.  Sendmail isn&#x27;t the only game in town anymore, and I expect most outfits use something else these days, and USENET is a distant memory for most people, so there go another two chapters.<p>But then the terminal&#x2F;TTY situation has barely changed, and how all that works is just as (if not more) divorced from the reality of daily usage.  Security has improved, but most people still have a god-mode root account, and most of the security improvements have come out of necessity; the world of networked computing is much more &quot;dangerous&quot; today than it was in the early 90s.

At least you can use TCP with it and not UDP, and you can configure it so you can actually interrupt file operations when the server unexpectedly goes away and doesn&#x27;t come back, instead of having to reboot your machine to clear things out.

Linux and BSD (either FreeBSD or 386BSD, I can&#x27;t recall which) where around, but Open Source (TM) as we now know it wasn&#x27;t.  Other, proprietary Unix systems were still viable and in use (AIX, IRIX, SunOS&#x2F;Solaris, HP-UX and SCO just to name a few).  Running Unix was <i>not</i> cheap [1].  Most X servers were proprietary and cost money (I had some friends that sold X servers for a variety of OSes and video cards at the time).  The criticisms at the time were, in my opinion, decent enough but not enough to stop to duopoly we have now with POSIX and Windows.<p>[1] In college, early 90s---I got to use IRIX on a machine that cost $30,000 in 1991.  PCs caught up and past it pretty much by the mid-late 90s.  Also, I did some consulting work at a bank which used SCO.  They paid God knows how much for every conceivable package available for SCO.

Slrnpull it&#x27;s a godsend.<p>- Current X it&#x27;s far better, but XPra&#x2F;x2Go should have been part of X.org, with far better features over the network<p>- GNU&#x2F;Emacs it&#x27;s <i>the</i> alternative from MIT&#x2F;ITS&#x2F;PDP-10 to Unix&#x27;s &#x27;worse it&#x27;s better&#x2F;KISS&#x27;, but it&#x27;s slower, error prone and easily deleted to much the .emacs file by itself with M-x customize -it deleted my (use-package) functions -.

- GNUS it&#x27;s dog slow on -current day- sized mail boxes (&gt; 100MB) and it will last an hour on big mail lists&#x2F;Usenet spools. Mbsync&#x2F;slrnpull helps but as I said anywhere else Maildir support in GNU&#x27;s it&#x27;s broken and it will only show some directories, if any. Even if &#x27;new&#x27;, &#x27;cur&#x27; and &#x27;tmp&#x27; are already there.<p>- RMail should had supported Maildir long ago. No, movemail it&#x27;s not an option and the current mailboxes will choke on the Unix MBOX format.<p>- Unfocussing the minibuffer prompt shouldn&#x27;t cancel it. For Mastodon password prompts (or any other one), switching to a pane&#x2F;window in Exwm (almost mandatory) will force you to repeat the login process on mastodon.el from the start. That&#x27;s atrocious.<p>- DIsplaying &quot;big&quot; images (relatively) it&#x27;s slow, dog slow. IDK how pdf-tools does it (it works really fast and well), but doc-view it&#x27;s a disaster and reading big CBZ files will crawl down Emacs.
Inb4 &#x27;Emacs it&#x27;s an editor, focus on the text&#x27; Emacs comes up with Calc with has plotting support with Gnuplot and OFC it needs a proper image displaying method.<p>- Eww should support minimal CSS rules to parse at least simple pages as HN.<p>- Stop locking on I&#x2F;O, period.<p>- The UI, even the Lucid&#x2F;Athena port, it&#x27;s not smooth at all even with some changes under some &#x27;legacy&#x27; top-hier 32 bit machines, such as N270 netbooks. I&#x27;m missing something for sure.<p>- Emacs notifications shouldn&#x27;t be bound to dbus, the notifiication system should allow using messages and a beep&#x2F;sound file as a method to alert the user, or a custom made script or Elisp code.<p>&quot;

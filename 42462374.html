It’s the same phenomenon as the widespread loss of trust in “professionals” and institutions, but in the cultural sphere.<p>Critics can sometimes be aloof or out of touch, but the alternative is basically just money-driven populism untethered to any deeper notions of quality.<p>They could be huge jerks, but I lament the fact that people like John Simon or H. L. Mencken don’t exist anymore.

Back when punishing was difficult, those with the means to disseminate information needed a reliable way to get opinions on a topic: the professional critic. But around the turn of the millennium that changed, and we now have a plethora of ways to just access the opinions of fans and laypeople.<p>Of course paradoxically we now also have more professional critics than ever before. We just call them reviewers and influencers. A lot of them shallow or outright bought, but that has always been an issue with critics. But if you avoid the bad actors you will find insightful critics on the most obscure topics.

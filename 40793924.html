I&#x27;ve played with it in emulators and it&#x27;s pretty fun. I love early attempts at making programming accessible to people.<p>To a <i>much</i> lesser extent, I feel like Flash (the animation program, not the player) kind of gave me that feeling the first time I used it.  Flash was so immediately approachable compared to trying to figure out something like C++ with OpenGL or SDL or something, and it was just downright fun to create things with it.<p>I&#x27;ve really not found anything since Flash that I&#x27;ve had as much fun developing in. Gamemaker is cool and still pretty fun, but I still don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s quite as streamlined and it doesn&#x27;t give me the same &quot;anything is possible&quot; feeling Flash did.

HyperCard put the power of a GUI into your hands with simple metaphors and syntax.  The language is English-like enough to feel easy to use, but not so much as to fool you into thinking it can do things it actually can&#x27;t do (looking at you, Inform 7!).  You&#x27;d attach code to widgets in a visual way that drove home the idea that <i>this</i> bit of code generated <i>that</i> behavior when you clicked a button, typed into a text field, <i>etc.</i>  Oh, and, let&#x27;s not forget that the HyperCard environment also implemented object persistence, which came in handy, because you wouldn&#x27;t have to write file handling code, or any kind of &quot;save state&quot; functionality.  Of course, you could also mess up a stack in such a way that it was hard to figure out and hard to fix due to said semantics, but, on balance, I&#x27;d say transparent object persistence was a pretty big win.<p>And, it was literally <i>right there</i> if you had a Mac.  After selling it briefly as a standalone product for $49.95, Apple started bundling it with every new Mac for about a decade.  If your Mac came with System 6, 7, 8, or 9, you had HyperCard.  It also came with the Apple IIGS during that time. (Great machine, BTW!)  Despite its limitations, I even remember seeing a couple of nontrivial apps implemented with it.<p>More than anything, HyperCard made personal computing <i>personal</i> again, in a way it hadn&#x27;t been since computers would boot straight into a BASIC interpreter, and that was a very good thing.<p>If my little spiel wasn&#x27;t convincing enough, take a look at this excerpt: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvxmelody.net&#x2F;HyperCard%20IIGS%201.1%20-%20The%20Apple%20II%20Guide%201992.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvxmelody.net&#x2F;HyperCard%20IIGS%201.1%20-%20The%20...</a></div><br/><div id="40795629" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40795629" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">frogulis</span><span>|</span><a href="#40794969">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40795252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40795695">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40795629">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40795629">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; looking at you, Inform 7!<p>Oh!

Everything was self taught from reading books that I either got from my dad&#x27;s co-worker or from the library.<p>HyperCard was so easy to learn for me as a kid. For one, it was all visual. If you wanted to add a button for someone to click, you would select &quot;Add Button&quot; and drag it to where you wanted it to be. In addition, you could learn how to do things from other HyperCard stacks by clicking on various buttons and reading what the script for those buttons did.<p>Since I was self taught (and very young), I didn&#x27;t know anything about data structures or algorithms. However, HyperCard made everything intuitive to me. To persist data, you could output it into &#x27;fields&#x27; (which like buttons, could be created by clicking &#x27;new field&#x27; and placing it where you wanted). While I later learned how to make these fields invisible, when I first started I would just make them really small and put them in a corner behind something else. I would then write data to them from button scripts, allowing me to persist data.<p>Since I didn&#x27;t know about data structures, I would treat everything as strings that I would store in these fields. I didn&#x27;t know what an array was, so I just would create a long string of comma separated values that I would read in, act on, and then write back out to the fields. I created primitive databases by having each line of the field be a different record... I had never heard the term &#x27;csv&#x27; at the time, but it just seemed natural to me.<p>Debugging was easy; I could just expand the fields into my visible view to see what was being written to them. Things being &#x27;object oriented&#x27; was very natural, since everything in HyperCard is a visual object you can interact with.<p>I learned SO MUCH hacking around with HyperCard. It made me love programming, and it was so much fun. I didn&#x27;t even realize how much I was learning until much later in life; I avoided majoring in computer science because I feared ruining my favorite hobby if I pursued it as a career. Later (after not finding an alternative to pursue after graduating college) I decided to give software development a try, and I realized how much I already knew just from HyperCard. Event driven architectures just made sense, because that is how HyperCard always worked. I had a pretty good grasp of data structures because I had created them visually as I needed them, without realizing what I was doing.<p>33 years later, I still get a thrill from programming that HyperCard instilled in me.<p>So yeah, HyperCard changed my life.</div><br/><div id="40796330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40796330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whartung</span><span>|</span><a href="#40794969">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40795814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40795886">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40796330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40796330">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Itâs funny, the graphic nature of Hypercard is what put me off of it.<p>It was essentially MacPaint with a few controls and a scripting language.

There are a bunch of simple GUI-builder tools, including GUI builders for the web, but none of them are <i>popular</i>, due to the sweet spot of supply and demand that Hypercard hit.<p>When Hypercard launched, it came with every Mac, it was free, and there was nothing else like it available on the Mac. On the Mac, the alternative to Hypercard was to layout UI widgets in code, with no GUI builder at all, or eventually to pay $$$ for a professional-grade IDE like CodeWarrior. As an entry-level user with no budget, if you wanted a GUI builder for the Mac, you got Hypercard, or nothing. This created a community of Hypercard enthusiasts.<p>Furthermore, when Hypercard launched, Macs had a standard screen resolution. Every Mac sold had a screen resolution of 512x342 pixels, so you could know for sure how your cards would look on any Mac. Supporting resizable GUIs is one of the hardest things to do in any GUI builder. (How should the buttons layout when the screen gets very small, like a phone? Or very wide, like a 16:9 monitor?) Today, Xcode uses a sophisticated constraint solver &#x2F; theorem prover to allow developers to build resizable UIs in a GUI; it works pretty well, I think, but it&#x27;s never going to be as easy to learn as &quot;drag the button onto the screen and it&#x27;s going to look <i>exactly</i> like that everywhere.&quot;<p>The last issue is the real killer for modern Hypercard wannabes: it&#x27;s a small step from a web GUI builder to raw HTML&#x2F;CSS. You don&#x27;t have to pay big bucks to have access to professional-grade HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sure, they&#x27;re not that easy to learn, but you can teach a kid to write interactive web pages, no problem.<p>As a result, the demand for a simple GUI builder is lower than it was for Hypercard, and even when you do capture a user, they tend to outgrow your product, and there are a zillion competitors, so none of them can build a community with real traction.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40794963" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40794963" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">metadat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40794929">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40795586">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40794982">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40794963">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40794963">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">HyperCard is more limited (which acted as a forcing function for creative solutions) and also had an approachability which far surpasses that of HTML&#x2F;JS.

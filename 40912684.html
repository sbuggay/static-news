Likewise for the theological &quot;function&quot; at the start. If it were to <i>determine</i> whether God exists it would need inputs on which to base that determination. Instead, two functions are presented along with a theological rule to choose between the two. The properties of the functions have nothing to do with the theological question.<p>I get that that&#x27;s the point of the article, and that the quoted homework question correctly refers to two functions. I just felt that it wasn&#x27;t particularly clearly spelled out and that the article seemed to blur the distinction between the functions and the choices between functions, which would probably further confuse those suffering from the misconception he describes (while heaping scorn upon them).<p>Edit: And this seems to really muddy the waters:<p>&gt; The deeper lesson Sipser was trying to impart is that the concept of computability applies to functions or infinite sequences, not to individual yes-or-no questions or individual integers.<p>Regardless of Sipser&#x27;s motivations the question doesn&#x27;t say anything about the difference between individual values and functions&#x2F;sequences. What it reveals is the difference between a well defined mathematical function and a choice one might make or imagine <i>between</i> various such functions (the criteria for which may or may not be well defined).<p>I could replace the question about God with one about whether some other function (which we haven&#x27;t yet determined the computability of) is computable and it would still be the case that &quot;the function we have defined is computable&quot;. (Scare quotes because that&#x27;s actually a category error and the correct observation is that &quot;both functions we have defined are computable&quot;. Hmm, well given the computability of the third function is well defined, though unknown, I suppose in this case we actually have defined a single unknown function, but the point about the difference between the choice and the functions stands.)</div><br/><div id="40913868" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913868" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akira2501</span><span>|</span><a href="#40913428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913582">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913868">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913868">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I could replace the question about God with one about whether some other function<p>Saint Anselm&#x27;s Ontological Theory of Computation.  &quot;First..  imagine the most perfect function that could possibly exist..&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="40913582" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913582" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">soganess</span><span>|</span><a href="#40913428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913868">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913582">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913582">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">isn&#x27;t it actually one program?

They can draw or sculpt or carve. They can play instruments and drive cars... But they&#x27;re terrible with computers.<p>They are afraid to touch anything thinking the settings panel is full of instantly catch fire buttons.  They touch the mouse with uncomfortable body language, like it&#x27;s a pocket knife that has an overcomplicated spring mechanism you don&#x27;t trust.<p>They don&#x27;t try to solve problems themselves because they have lots of anxiety when they go near one.<p>In real life it doesn&#x27;t work to say &quot;Yeah I have no idea how any of this works but there&#x27;s an undo button&quot;.<p>These highly capable people also seem to have boredom issues too. They can physically build something a faster than they can design and 3D print it.  It probably doesn&#x27;t feel as exciting when you can already do everything the machine can.<p>Apple is considered the top company for n00bs, but they rely heavily in gestures and your own memory. I suspect that it&#x27;s not an easy system for &quot;idiots&quot; as some think, it&#x27;s a system for people who aren&#x27;t comfortable with indirection and like direct control.<p>Everyone always thinks users are idiots, but they can all do so much that I can&#x27;t. I suspect they&#x27;re just used to freedom living in the moment, and are strongly tactile and connected to their body, so that they don&#x27;t really feel the artificial abstractions as real things they trust, plus they have active minds and are distracted by not understanding how something works, instead of just accepting it as probably some nonsense that a drunk coder made up that can&#x27;t be changed because legacy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38138757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38138757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">defanor</span><span>|</span><a href="#38139019">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38139027">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38138757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38138757">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A nice article overall, but:<p>&gt; Never do something for someone that they are capable of doing for themselves.<p>This seems like a good approach, and as if it must be educational, yet people may become upset if you are not helping them, likely because they are not sure if they are capable of doing those things. Even seemingly simple tasks occasionally turn out harder than expected: particularly online services often malfunction, so you have to work around their issues, often employing non-trivial technical expertise, creativity, and persistence to get things done; I think such cases erode the confidence of less tech-savvy people, and dealing with this broken stuff is an unpleasant experience even for tech-savvy ones. So, sometimes by doing something for someone that they are (probably) capable of doing for themselves, you can save them from some stress. Occasionally trying to do things on their own is still needed for learning, but not necessarily all the time.</div><br/><div id="38138873" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38138873" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kubanczyk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38138757">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38139027">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38138873">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38138873">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; yet people may become upset if you are not helping them<p>Fair take.

Iâm bad at windows, Iâm bad at office and Iâm terrible at printers. And since they always used whatever standard browser and usually some obscoure e-mail program for the e-mail that came with their cable internet 9 billion years ago, it wasnât fun to be the âIT guyâ just because I know how to write programs.<p>It was truly amazing for me when they all bought iPads and never needed any form of support that their immediate family couldnât handle for them. Not only that though, it helped them get into the digital age, so they could use their online banking, be on social media with their grand children and be somewhat protected from themselves and the wider internet by Apples walled garden.<p>Of course the flip-side of this is that a lot of people arenât actually very good at using computers today. Which ironically is a much bigger issue for younger people than the elderly. When I was in the public sector it was the 18-25 age group which scored the lowest on âdigital prowessâ which meant theyâd sometimes get in a lot of trouble because they failed to perform some very basic tasks, like filling out a form on a website because âit wasnât an appâ. I guess you could argue that the public sector is sort of at fault for not building apps for everything to keep up with the times, but itâs something we see everywhere in society still. My wife works with dyslexic youths and it continues to amaze her just how much help they need to get the helper programs our government programs supply students with to work. To you and me it would likely to be a fairly simple task to get some document reader to work on Mac OS but she has students who need repeated lessons in how to keep it updated or not get locked out of it, or even how to get it to use a library as default if they arenât saving things in the standard documents folder. I guess for most people it doesnât really matter, but I think itâs amazing that weâre so digitally illiterate as a society in 2023.

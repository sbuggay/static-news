For instance the question about what is consciousness has changed as we&#x27;ve become more knowledgeable about neurology and even of quantum mechanics.<p>What philosophy does is to teach one to think and reason in ways that one otherwise would not have done. It enlarges one&#x27;s worldview which makes it easier for one to grasp new ideas and concepts, and to be open to fields of knowledge that one may have otherwise bypassed.<p>Add to that reading the works of great philosophers is a mind-opening experience. Many of these works have stood the test of time because the ideas they contain have widened the minds of those who&#x27;ve studied them.</div><br/><div id="40167084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40167084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mykowebhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40154098">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40166870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40167084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40167084">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">YES! And if it enlarges one&#x27;s worldview, it&#x27;s because Philosophy stands as the root, the superset if you will, of all other areas of knowledge, art, science, etc. For example, if Gödel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem explores the boundaries of what Mathematics can know and we want to seriously understand what this means, then we are entering Philosophy.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40166870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40166870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#40154098">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40166870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40166870">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Deleuze defined philosophy as something like “the creation of concepts.” I’ve always found that to be the best way to think of the field. It’s also a refreshingly creative one, because “philosophy” courses tend to really be “history of philosophy” courses that cover already-existing concepts.</div><br/><div id="40167045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40167045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mykowebhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40166870">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40167045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40167045">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Although I find the notion of philosophy being like &quot;the creation of concepts&quot; rather limiting (philosophy can be this, but much more), if we stick with this notion, I still think it&#x27;s not entirely correct.<p>If philosophy were to create concepts, then the question immediately arises of how one would determine whether these concepts were created correctly, or truthfully. The understanding here is that concepts are universal, and not contingent on anything, including on how they were &quot;created&quot;. Instead, I think Deleuze should have defined philosophy as something like &quot;the discovery of concepts, a discovery that, once accomplished, reveals to us something we had already known.&quot;<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m defining concept not in the regular, everyday way, but more in line with Hegelian, Idealist way--der Begriff.</div><br/><div id="40167089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40167089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#40166870">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40167045">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40167089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40167089">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t think I’d call Deleuze “wrong” based on my one line description, if you haven’t read him yourself.<p>The rest of your comment seems predicated on a Platonic idea of concepts; which is definitely not in line with how Deleuze thinks about things. His ideas are very much not in line with the typical way of thinking about concepts as universal things we discover.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Spam - once the app is large enough, you will be inundated with &#x27;groups&#x27; that are just marketing pitches for companies and products. If you don&#x27;t have a system for approving groups or figuring out how to promote high-quality over low-quality groups, you&#x27;re going to struggle. Also, the whole idea of &#x27;high-quality&#x27; vs &#x27;low-quality&#x27; groups is dangerous in various ways.<p>2. All the other pitfalls of user-made content, e.g. hate speech and inappropriate content<p>3.

I&#x27;ve seen all of these issues.<p>1. Spam - there&#x27;s a question of definition. I&#x27;ve seen lots of bars post their happy hour etc. Is that an event or just an ad for the bar? Lots of meet ups that are really just an hour long pitch for some service&#x2F;software&#x2F;consulting. I&#x27;ve seen a groups post the same event under different names 10-15 times. I&#x27;ve also seen groups somehow claim 300 people are coming to their event even though the venue only holds 80 people. I don&#x27;t know what kind of backdoor they found since this &quot;300+ people&quot; was the number reported by the service itself, not just something in the description.<p>5. I don&#x27;t know what &quot;too many features&quot; is but I did enjoy posting images to meet ups. Sure that can be done via some other service but that requires all the people at the event to coordinate separately from the fact that they already signed up for the event. OTOH I&#x27;m sure hosting images brings up all kinds of problems. Similarly, the &quot;chat&quot; feature has been invaluable for coordination. Show up to a picnic, need to find out where they ended up, check the chat on the event page.<p>&gt; Then there&#x27;s the fact that their search experience is just terrible.<p>Agreed - but you don&#x27;t have search yet or if you do it wasn&#x27;t clear. I assume that&#x27;s on your TODO list.<p>That brings up issue 2, user made content. Maybe AI can categorize events from descriptions but on many sites with user content, people will tag themselves with whatever they think will get search results, even if their event is entirely unrelated. Which then ruins the results and makes the experience bad.<p>In any case, I which you luck.

I’m glad to see alternatives coming about, but I’m also somewhat skeptical this can actually solve our dissatisfaction with Meetup. As an event organizer, I don’t really need that many fancy features. I need a product that is moderately priced and will actually get people to walk in the door when I schedule an event. Focus on building network effects because that is what group organizers are ultimately paying for. I think this is solved by gaining large amounts of capital to support a promotional strategy to compete. I don’t think a lot of energy needs to be spent on building every feature that an attendee would want because ultimately they will never pay for anything and will continue to use the service as long as interesting groups stay put. Put differently, I don’t think you need to make features your differentiating factor to win. Event organizers, a.k.a. the people who ultimately pay for the service, have serious problems with the pricing strategy they are being offered by Meetup but have no viable alternative.

The service is simple, non-profit, its management is open, and it&#x27;s free. It mostly replaced couchsurfing, at least in the cities in europe where I used it.<p>Can the same be done with meetup?

This raises a few auth complications, e.g. if the event organiser wants to post their event ideally they&#x27;d be able to take ownership of the placeholder event uploaded by the community member.

The apps in the meetup space are so bad there is a lot of potential here for new platforms.<p>It is interesting that both you and the comments are focused on event discovery.  I am looking at it from a different angle.  I am looking for a platform that can keep a calendar of events and rsvps for already-established small nonprofits and community groups - like book clubs, board meetings, local political groups, etc.  In my opinion there are lot of social networks that are doing a decent job of event discovery out there (as much as you can in our very fragmented world).  The problem is organizing who is going to what without using Outlook, Google Calendar, etc. - also with better options for recurring events and notifications&#x2F;reminders, and something non-tech-savvy people can use.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40731522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40731522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s17n</span><span>|</span><a href="#40733406">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40731753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40731522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40731522">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Meetup has steadily gone to shit, and it&#x27;s not hard to see why: you can&#x27;t make money with a user-friendly platform for hosting community groups.

Given that my use case is not about making money, I don&#x27;t want to be spending money either. Meetup seemed to only have high budget events, many of which needed money to join. It would be very nice to have a place where you can just have non-money-related events (free to post, free to attend). Perhaps making everything that does not (generally) charge money to attend free would be a good choice for you.<p>Also, there should be a map so I can see as pins on a map which upcoming events are physically close to me.

You might want to consider hiding the numbers of groups and events until you have numbers that are likely to impress anyone viewing them. No shame at all in starting small (there&#x27;s really no other way to start). But you might turn away potential users who think you&#x27;re likely to disappear.</div><br/><div id="40730994" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40730994" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">djbusby</span><span>|</span><a href="#40730843">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40733451">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40730994">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40730994">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But small numbers are a signal to the visitors they are early.

Pretty much everyone I know is on meetup, and if they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re on facebook. The experience isn&#x27;t great but good luck getting anyone to sign up to a new random site. It&#x27;s also very risky for people hosting events to switch over.<p>So I would focus on that more than any technical features other than group&#x2F;event discovery.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Science is a remarkable collective effort of humanity, and it is crucial that we continue to allocate resources to this endeavor.<p>If anything, studying the history of science would open one&#x27;s eyes to the fact that the methodologies and approaches that have resulted in a vast reservoir of knowledge have not followed a linear or consistent path throughout time.<p>There&#x27;s a quote from his first blog post titled &quot;A Clean-Sheet Introduction to the Scientific Method&quot; that is unironically portraying science as a human endeavour somehow relieved of everything that made &quot;religion&quot; bad.<p>&gt; Let me start with the easy part: By &quot;religious beliefs&quot; I do not mean to imply that science is a religion in the usual sense.  It isn&#x27;t.  Religions generally involve things like the worship of deities, respect for the authority of revealed wisdom, and the carrying out of prayer and rituals.  Science has none of that, not because science rejects these things <i>a priori</i>, but because when you pursue science you are invariably (but not inevitably!) led to the conclusion that there are no deities active in our universe, and therefore no good reason to accept the authority of revealed wisdom, and hence not much point spending valuable time on prayer and ritual<p>Science as an insistution has all those hallmarks: worship, authority and rituals. I&#x27;m not trying to make a case for religion here, but wanted to point out the shallowness of the whole write-up. I wish these science preaching guys would actually engage in more science worthy attitudes and be a bit more humble in their holistic assessment of what does and what doesn&#x27;t constitute science.<p>Anything goes! would Paul Feyerabend say.</div><br/><div id="40233300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40233300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">remoquete</span><span>|</span><a href="#40233263">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40233392">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40233300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40233300">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah, Feyerabend.

The objective fact of the matter, as I point out in the first article in the series, is that the scientific method produces vastly more accurate predictions than anything else humans have ever tried.

(This can be restated in an unsettling, for a natural science enthusiast, manner as “there is always the unexplained”.)<p>2. We cannot know where the incorrectness&#x2F;incompleteness lies.<p>However, the arrogance of modern natural science due to its success makes us disinclined and demotivated to look outside the box of its current models and tempts us into, e.g., treating the entities described by <i>current models</i> (wrong, per above) as ground truth, treating consciousness (you’d think, the only thing we have direct access to) as an illusion (red flag, explaining away), etc. Thus, we get entrenched in a local maximum.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40233467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40233467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raskelll</span><span>|</span><a href="#40233263">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40233392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40233896">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40233385">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40233467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40233467">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The arrogance I mentioned is directed towards the people who think of themselves as appropriate to speak for the century-long success story of science itself while not really addressing (and understanding) how science emerged.

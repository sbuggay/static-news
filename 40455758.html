This worked well enough for two titles to be released to a few tens of thousands of customers, who enjoyed them well enough.<p>A days before the clients started shipping the titles they&#x27;d built with my engine, I went back to look at the floppy disks for the &quot;master engine&quot; series, which would be the last update to the engine itself, just to be sure - and by then I needed a raw disk copying routine for another project, so I took a close look at the prior results to see if there were any major issues.<p>Sure enough, in the &#x27;empty&#x27; sectors of the engine disks I&#x27;d produced, I&#x27;d managed to include things that looked suspiciously like a DOS FAT-based filesystem.  This was because I&#x27;d simply reused the same floppy to produce beta versions of the engine disks, and someone had taken one of my old master beta disks and used it &#x27;temporarily&#x27;, to copy some files for themselves, on MS-DOS machines.  Lucky I caught it - we really didn&#x27;t need to include a resignation letter in the empty spaces of the multimedia titles.<p>Anyway, this story brought back fond memories of making a multimedia engine that didn&#x27;t use MS-DOS .. and also, 40 years later, reminded me to <i>always</i> check the edge cases before you ship a master&#x2F;gold release to customers who will ship it to tens of thousands of people ..

TSR stands for &quot;terminate and stay resident&quot;, basically background programs in DOS. It&#x27;s somewhat similar to what you would call a &quot;daemon&quot; in Unix, though much more &quot;free form&quot; and low level.<p>One such early TSR of mine hooked the disk services interrupt (INT 13h I believe), which got invoked whenever you want to access the disk through the BIOS (so, almost always), and my program then output a little &quot;click&quot; over the speaker. The result was as if you took the already very audible seeking of spinning hard disks and made it really, really loud. It wasn&#x27;t even my idea, just a fun premise to fiddle with hooking interrupt handlers.<p>I compiled&#x2F;assembled the TSR, ran it, and typed &quot;DIR&quot;. The expected clicking came out of the speaker with every disk access, which indeed sounded funny and great, but at the end of the directory listing, an error appeared. I typed &quot;DIR&quot; again, and now listing the directory failed entirely.<p>In a bout of incredible stupidity, I typed &quot;CD \&quot; to change to the root directory, and &quot;DIR&quot; again. Now I couldn&#x27;t list my root directory. I reset my computer and... DOS did not boot anymore.<p>It suddenly became immediately clear what I had done. My interrupt handler, after outputting the click over the speaker, obviously had to call back into the old handler, to actually service the requested disk access. When saving and restoring the registers that instruct the original handler what disk access to perform, I must have messed up in a way that it, at least sufficiently often, converted a read access into a write access. I don&#x27;t remember the details, probably just flipping a single bit would do that. But effectively I&#x27;ve overwritten every sector of my root directory (and the original working one) with junk.<p>So I had destroyed at least my root directory, and hence lost access to all my data.<p>With lots of work I probably could have pieced my root directory back together. Nowadays, I&#x27;d probably have taken it as an exciting challenge to write a program that heuristically does just that by itself. Back then, I&#x27;m pretty sure I just abandoned the file system and started over.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40457349" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40457349" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sumtechguy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40456538">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40461591">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40456973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40457349">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40457349">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I blew away a boot sector once playing that game....</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40456973" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40456973" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrguyorama</span><span>|</span><a href="#40456538">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40460464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40456973">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40456973">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This exact situation actually happened all the time.

If other studios wanted to get into adventure games they didn&#x27;t need to steal AGI to do it. And no one with a functioning brain would have used a stolen game engine for a commercial game. Companies don&#x27;t want to give away their code but in the case of adventure games it&#x27;s not because they are worried about their competitors.<p>The other assertion that&#x27;s off-base is that this would have been a sackable offense. No. Sierra still had legal protection against competitors using their game engine. This goof, while a little embarassing, had no real financial or security or any other damaging implications for the company.

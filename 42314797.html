This definition roughly matches most people&#x27;s intuition of what &quot;living paycheck-to-paycheck&quot; means. That isn&#x27;t nothing but it implies 85-90% of Americans are not actually living paycheck-to-paycheck.<p>There is another 25-30% of households that spend all of their income on ordinary expenses beyond necessary expenses. This includes things like car payments on a new BMW or a mortgage on a big house; &quot;ordinary&quot; is determined by expense category, not expense necessity, so a lot of spending on luxury goods is classified as &quot;ordinary&quot;. By implication, there is effectively no ceiling to ordinary expenses.<p>By contrast, the median US household has &gt;$12,000&#x2F;year in excess income after <i>all ordinary expenses</i>. Technically these households could have expanded their lifestyle to consume that income, but in many cases they are spending it on things that are not classified as &quot;ordinary&quot; and therefore not saving it. The categories of &quot;non-ordinary&quot; expenses (which have a sensible objective criteria) are almost entirely obvious lifestyle flex things, so not particularly controversial.<p>The implications of these statistics are pretty wild. The median household can easily accumulate a million dollars in inflation-adjusted net worth, not including their house, over a 40 year career. And they can do it without being particularly thrifty, since ordinary expenses covers a lot of luxury spending.<p>Americans have very high incomes, both in theory and practice, they just would rather spend it than save it.</div><br/><div id="42325915" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42325915" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ProxCoques</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324206">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42325915">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42325915">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also by the Fed: 4 in 10 Americans lack enough money to cover a $400 emergency expense:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;23&#x2F;inflation-economy-consumer-finances-americans-cant-cover-emergency-expense-federal-reserve&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;23&#x2F;inflation-economy-consumer-fi...</a></div><br/><div id="42326147" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42326147" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CalRobert</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325915">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42326102">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42326147">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42326147">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Question EF3.

A typical chicken breast is 1&#x2F;3lb to 1&#x2F;2lb before cooking, so you’re really looking at roughly $5.50 per cooked chicken breast.<p><i>Uncooked</i> organic chicken breast is $10&#x2F;lb [2] at the same store.

Making better than average life choices provides a lot of insurance against bad luck over the long run.<p>An under-appreciated point that extends far beyond the financial is that Americans have an anomalously high amount of optionality in life.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42324253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42324253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refurb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324487">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322991">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42324253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42324253">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">** ...

If income is $50k&#x2F;person and household size is 2, the reported income is $71k&#x2F;person. If household size increases to 3, reported income increases to $87k&#x2F;person.<p>On the average, Americans move out of their parents&#x27; home in their mid-20s. Swiss people typically do it a couple of years earlier. When people in their 20s live with their parents, it often indicates the lack of affordable housing. But if you combine this with normalizing household incomes by dividing by the square root of household size, higher housing costs lead to higher reported disposable incomes.<p>International comparisons are difficult, because pretty much every way to do them is wrong in some sense. But in general, it&#x27;s better to collect data that is consistently wrong in the same way than to try to correct the issues you encounter. If your data is consistently wrong, you can at least make reasonable comparisons between a country today and the same country 10 or 20 years ago.<p>Subsidized services such as education and healthcare are tricky. You could try to calculate the subsidies based on the actual costs of providing the services, or as the difference between the nominal price and the subsidized price. These can lead to very different amounts, and it&#x27;s not always possible to use the same approach with every service.<p>If the degree of subsidies varies between countries, you could try to normalize the situation by either adding the subsidies to disposable incomes or subtracting the costs the individual has to pay. In a country where the services are more expensive to produce (and maybe also less efficient), the former leads to higher and the latter lower disposable incomes relative to other countries.<p>Retirement contributions are another tricky question. Voluntary savings are often included in disposable income, while mandatory pension contributions often count as taxes. But you can&#x27;t always tell the difference between voluntary retirement savings and other savings. But if you then count retirement income based on voluntary contributions as disposable income, you have to be careful to avoid counting the same income twice.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42323771" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323771" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klipt</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323564">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323977">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323771">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323771">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; larger household would make the median income per person lower not larger.<p>Depends whether the household is larger due to children, or due to more adults, no?<p>That is, if a bunch of single adults pair up into households, income divided by household size will go up.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42323373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jorvi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323436">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324928">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323373">[28 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When taxes and mandatory contributions are subtracted from household income, the result is called net or disposable household income<p>I don’t understand why Americans always have such a fetish about bragging about their disposable income.

It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty&#x27;s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.<p>---<p>Of course, I&#x27;m sure none of that would ever apply to <i>our</i> numbers, only to those of our <i>opponents</i>.</div><br/><div id="42323005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">comicjk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323000">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323005">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What are the actual numbers you think are fantasy?

People claiming economic downturns are near are a dime a dozen.<p>That said, there are possible indicators. Yes, unemployment is low, but what form is employment taking? Is it generally trending toward fulfillment, growth and&#x2F;or rewarding or is it trending toward mundane, unfulfilling and&#x2F;or unrewarding?<p>Is everyone benefitting from the official economic growth? Or are the gains statistically lopsided?<p>Let’s take a common mentioned stat about wage growth. Yes since 2020 wages finally raised. But if you look at it overall since 1970[0], it still behind productivity gains. Wages are not keeping up with overall productivity growth and people are still going to notice that in some form. Everyone talks about since 2020, but that misses the broader story. (As an aside, I suspect by the end of 2025 wages will significantly stagnant again. Growth won’t continue on the best take of the current trajectory)<p>Then there’s inflation. Regardless of cause, an entire generation+ of people have never experienced such rapid prices rising, particularly with groceries. People aren’t going to forget this, no matter what the official line is. This also eats away at wage growth which as noted above, has not kept paced with productivity gains.<p>The official sources though say everything is great, or heading toward it.

People should not consider their primary residence to be an investment; in truth it should be an expense and a liability.  But the expectation here (fueled by market-distorting policy) is that home values always go up, and that homeowners can expect to sell their house in some amount of years at a profit.<p>As houses get older, their value should decrease.  Even large-scale renovations often should not push the value up quite as much as one would hope.  Certainly the value of <i>land</i> can go up, based on housing&#x2F;zoning policy, coupled with supply and demand in a particular area.<p>At any rate, most things are temporary.  Interest rates are headed downward again, and the Fed expects to make more cuts.  Presumably we won&#x27;t get back down to zero, but that&#x27;s probably a good thing.<p>Also let&#x27;s consider history: interest rates are still objectively not all that high right now.  They&#x27;re on par with or lower than what rates were in much of the 90s, and even some of the 00s.  It&#x27;s only the 10s that saw zero rates.  And hell, go back to the 80s and prior, and the current rate situation looks delightfully low.<p>&gt; <i>High interest rates have also helped crash the real estate market, so even if you just own a home, you&#x27;ve taken a bath since the high interest policy has been implemented.</i><p>A note on this: so what?  What matters is the cost of comparable housing.  If my house has lost 25% of its value, it stands to reason that similar houses in similarly-desirable locations will have lost a similar amount, and still be affordable for me if I wanted to sell my house and move.<p>But again we run into the problems caused by the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage!  Anyone who has bought a house with a mortgage recently enough, at a price high enough, might be in a situation where they can&#x27;t move because they won&#x27;t be able to sell their current house at a high enough price in order to pay off their mortgage (and still have enough of a down payment for their next house).

That&#x27;s certainly more expensive even in the meantime than having a lower-rate loan to start, and there&#x27;s always the risk that rates don&#x27;t actually come down, but it&#x27;s an option for many (admittedly not all).</div><br/><div id="42324913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42324913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">willis936</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323362">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323330">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42324913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42324913">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If lower interest rates are not coming then how can the low rates of the oughts be framed as anything other than generational theft?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42323330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">forgetfreeman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322946">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323362">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323330">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe. the 15% interest rates in the 80s made a lot of working class families a shitload of money due to the magic of compound interest.</div><br/><div id="42323496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cfraenkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323330">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323496">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You obviously didn&#x27;t live through it, or you wouldn&#x27;t be spouting such offensive, naive nonsense.

I.e. dress and personal technology shibboleths, etc.<p>—-<p>It is worth pointing out that the large role of real estate as a passive wealth compounder, tracking up with the product of increased overall economy and inequality growth, is perverse enough.<p>But the common arrangement of property taxes that tax both land (the limited and exclusionary asset) and its development (the non-exclusionary asset we should not be disincentivizing in any way), adds another perversity to land economics.<p>When a problem compounds already, it doesn’t need any more perverse incentives!<p>If property taxes were replaced by just land taxes (renormalized to be revenue neutral) it would:<p>1. increase the return on development, and<p>2. increase the costs of holding (absolutely or relatively) undeveloped land!<p>Which would both increase development (i.e. housing, multi-housing) and increase supply of (relatively) unused land.<p>This would be a net win for those who are impacted or concerned about inequality, but also those with a libertarian or capitalist viewpoint. As it removes a wealth tax. (Which isn’t just a double tax, but an unlimited repetitive tax on the same already taxed&#x2F;unrealized non-exclusionary wealth!)<p>Whether rich or poor, improving one’s property with already taxed capital or self-supplied labor, would not perversely raise one’s taxes.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42322160" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42322160" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42321897">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322071">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322159">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42322160">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42322160">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As if those are the only two choices.

I don&#x27;t have time right now, but I&#x27;d encourage anyone reading this to go find the actual source for this stat and read their full report. Last time I looked, it was freely available.<p>Many of those people living paycheck to paycheck have a budget where they&#x27;re saving or investing a significant amount of their money, and accordingly, money feels tight. This is the financially sound way to avoid lifestyle creep, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re in a precarious position. Or alternatively, they&#x27;re paying for really expensive, but optional things like private schooling and expensive cars or vacations.<p>Obviously some people are struggling, but this paycheck-to-paycheck stat is not an accurate way to quantify that.

I think it is a little dubious when you use PPP to compare th3e size of two economies because 1) you are taking two approximate measurements and multiplying them 2) countries with lower GDP &#x2F; person typically have higher relative purchasing power.<p>In &quot;rich country&quot; (high GDP &#x2F;person) you can charge a lot for a cup of coffee.  In &quot;poorer country&quot; you are likely to charge less.  Therefore you can say that person in the poorer country is not as badly off as the absolute numbers suggest.  However, if &quot;poorer country&quot; got to the same GDP &#x2F; person purchasing parity might end up being almost the same.  Or, countries with lots of poor regions will have a better PPP, but the cost of living in the places where people have high income may have similar costs.<p>And in general the most valuable purchasing power differences don&#x27;t happen for the most valuable and traded goods.

That said, living in the mountain west friends of mine own guns, hunt, and one set of friends owned a gun related business for several years.<p>For the incidents 3 were school&#x2F;university shootings, 3 were in malls or similar public locations, and 1 was a house party. I don&#x27;t know of any real common theme beyond gatherings of people. One I included in the earlier post was a domestic incident with several deaths and so it might not belong with the others.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed my 50-60 year old friends and their children in high school are more concerned about school shootings than I ever was. That may just be excessive concern due to increased news coverage, but I think there is also something about the availability of guns and teenage brains that is a real concern for them.<p>My personal experience has only been hearing gunshots nearby, although one incident involved a death. I don&#x27;t think of myself as being in dangerous places but it has happened more than a few times. Guns and gun violence aren&#x27;t something I think about much at all, but when I do it&#x27;s surprising by how much it touches my life and my friend&#x27;s lives.<p>All that said, one thing I do appreciate about this country is the variety of it.

Getting simple residential permits can take half a year or more, environmental regulations have limited what even homeowners can do with their own houses, and the majority of the city is still zoned for only single family homes.<p>The high price of building means that daycares can&#x27;t open (too expensive to justify), and workers in all fields demand ever higher pay just so they can afford rent, which drives up the cost of everything.<p>For the last decade we&#x27;ve built 1&#x2F;2 as many houses as we&#x27;ve had people moving to the city, and a large percent of new dense construction is rental only, which means money leaving the city and residents not building up any equity (or long term stake) in the city.<p>Bad policies lead to bad outcomes.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42321546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42321546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jandrewrogers</span><span>|</span><a href="#42314987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321372">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322092">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322058">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42321546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42321546">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Most Americans have around a thousand dollars in savings and that is it.<p>Per the US government&#x27;s own BLS, the median household has &gt;$1,000 leftover <i>each month</i> after <i>all</i> ordinary expenses.

Those are effects, not causes or even the effects that directly drive discontent; yet by emphasizing those aspects we spend an inordinate amount of time on measures that attempt to address those symptoms specifically rather than the causes. But also...<p>1) Income share is complicated: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equitablegrowth.org&#x2F;labors-share-lost&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equitablegrowth.org&#x2F;labors-share-lost&#x2F;</a> There are structural issues, like automation and immigration, underlying those trends. Immigration isn&#x27;t, per se, irrelevant, especially when you consider dynamics like volatility and displacement. (But, again, it&#x27;s complicated.)<p>2) Throughout history vilifying the rich has not worked out well for the poor and working classes, neither in absolute nor relative terms. Where sustainable improvements have been seen, they&#x27;re the result of a flattening of the social hierarchy (not necessarily in monetary terms!), but in a way that shifts norms to the type of long-term, group management that you see in the upper middle classes, not the winner-take-all, rat race rules of the poor (at least, that they see as governing inter-class conflict, not necessarily among themselves). The cookie metaphor, both in the model it presents and the devious motivations it insinuates, is rat race rules, and rat race rules favor the rich much more than cooperative, inclusive norms. What you want is for the wealthier to <i>identify</i> with the poorer, but that can only happen (if at all) to the extent the poorer <i>identify</i> with the wealthier. If some wealthy person perceives themselves as having been wholly self-made, despite what&#x27;s obvious to everybody below him, good! That implies he at least <i>values</i> agency and work ethic, norms that in the United States can be and are shared with people below him on the ladder, and therefore a way to sell political concessions as being in his self-interest (psychologically).<p>3) Wealth (as opposed to income) doesn&#x27;t work as implied in the cookie metaphor. Elon Musk is a trillionaire, but there&#x27;s no bank vault with a trillion in gold bullion that he can go to at will. At any point in time--hour by hour, even--his nominal wealth is primarily a function of the future expectations of others, including expectations of social contentment and economic growth. You can&#x27;t take half of Musk&#x27;s cookies and redistribute to everyone; it&#x27;s entirely non-sensical to think that way. Our intuition breaks down at scale; certainly from a process perspective (as opposed to a static context). Just like running a $30 trillion national economy isn&#x27;t the same as running a small business (for one thing, nobody <i>runs</i> it), the cookie metaphor leads to horribly misguided ideas about the nature of our problems and the viability of remedies.<p>Yes, inequality of outcomes matters (at least at the margins), it just doesn&#x27;t provide much if any insight into causes and solutions. Imbibing in zero sum cookie narratives is counterproductive. Like other forms of social injustice, e.g. racism, it&#x27;s paradoxical--how can you fix something without identifying the effects with an intention to address them; yet, such a fixation has a tendency to solidify (reify?) the divisions undergirding them. If you look at critical theory, especially critical race theory, you can see an admission of this paradox at the core of the literature. People like Frantz Fanon and Derrick Bell came to the conclusion that it&#x27;s impossible to completely overcome racism--systemic and otherwise. Their perspective is understandable given the seeming intractability of these sorts of problem, I just don&#x27;t share the fundamental pessimism at the heart of how these issues are framed by contemporary social justice thinking. And it&#x27;s that framing that I saw in the cookie metaphor. I don&#x27;t have the right answers, but history has shown us the wrong answers.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42320808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42320808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pineaux</span><span>|</span><a href="#42314987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42320429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42320690">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42316530">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42320808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42320808">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">@wahern.

Especially with an ever increasing ageing population. If you want to take care of all of those people at a high quality of life, it&#x27;s gonna cost you, and we don&#x27;t have that kind of money anymore.<p>So you either get Europeans to accept slowly sliding into poverty due to declining welfare and rising CoL, OR, you need to bring in more money to the state somehow. Previously it was done in Europe via slavery and theft through colonialism, but since that conveyor belt of free money is gone and what&#x27;s left to bring in more money is innovation in highly profitable high-growth industries where EU is almost absent. No, ASML, Airbus and some struggling German mittlestand companies can&#x27;t support a whole continent like they did in the 1980&#x27;s.<p><i>&gt;I think a lot of people in the EU would be fine with being 3rd on &quot;productivity&quot; if it was enough to maintain a high standard of living and decent competitiveness.</i><p>They would be fine, if those losses would come out of the pockets of tax dodging corporations, but they&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re being eaten up by the working class and the taxpayer who still expects the same welfare quality like in the good ol&#x27; days when the EU economy was as strong as the US.<p>Do you you see how this level of welfare is unsustainable without matching economic growth?</div><br/><div id="42316148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42316148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sofixa</span><span>|</span><a href="#42314987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42316148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42316148">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You said<p>&gt; Without innovations and highly profitable industries generating well paying working class jobs, with what will you pay for that welfare and quality of life<p>Without presumes with none, and you&#x27;re saying it like it&#x27;s true.<p>&gt; The EU economy was at the same level as the US economy 15-20 years ago., now it&#x27;s only half the US.

Why are there so many fintechs which are a decade ahead of US counterparts (Revolut, Monzo, MyPOS, SumUp, Bunq, Qonto) and why is finance-related tech so much ahead - you can pay contactless pretty much anywhere in most of the EU and UK, you can accept card payments with your phone and just an app, all banks have to have an API with Oauth to be able to aggregate accounts and whatever?

Ok, I&#x27;ll bite.<p>Yes, the United States is big, but some areas are more dense than other and would need good heavy investment in public transit infrastructure. For example, the north eastern corridor would in particular benefit from investment in true high speed rail.<p>There&#x27;s also the need for investment in freight infrastructure, especially if we want to take off more trucks off the road. This is a safety benefit too. Less vehicles on the roads just mean less people risking their neck.<p>Now let&#x27;s talk more local public transit.<p>Atlanta for example, really need to expand heavy rail. Traffic there is one of the worst in the country. MARTA at time outpaces cars, even with all the stops they have to make. Rather, a lot of time is eaten up just waiting for the train. A more frequent schedule would help here, but Georgia would need to actually contribute funding to make this possible. If they extend it more into the surburb, I would have less of an incentive to move.

I merely wanted to point out that the fundamental absurdity of capitalism requiring infinite growth in a finite system has been resolved by having the growth of wealth coming from speculation on future unrealized value. Since I (or anyone else) can&#x27;t predict the future, it might happen that things do not come to pass as they were expected and that future value might not be realized. Money <i>is</i> divorced from reality, it derives its value from the collective trust and belief by the people participating in the system that it can be exchanged for goods and services. In a system of rational and impartial actors, that belief is backed by chiefly existence of said goods (which is the real size of the economic pie) and less by the speculation of future potential that might or or might not happen. So in summary my argument is not between communism or capitalism, but a captialism that is backed by real world value and one that is backed by future speculation. Even if the former can create less economic growth, we can be certain that growth is real.<p>- Central planning works. Great public works certainly are dreamt up and funded by governments yet they contribute enormously to the wealth of nations and enable a lot of value to be created. The moon landing was centrally planned and executed by a country whose per capita wealth was on par with modern day Poland, yet is considered the greatest achivement in history.<p>- There are no real &#x27;centrally planned&#x27; or &#x27;free market&#x27; economies, as all countries employ both concepts to some degree. But if we were to make a argument, we could say that the US belongs to the &#x27;free market&#x27; camp and China belongs the &#x27;centrally planned&#x27; camp. Both countries are doing extremely well, this very discussion is about finding which one is actually doing better.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42320595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42320595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bjourne</span><span>|</span><a href="#42314987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315102">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42315132">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42320595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42320595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Though it has very much decreased in recent years due to rampant inflation.

A lot of things you compare between two countries are in fact very different in reality. You might actually end up paying a lot more in nominal dollars for a lot of things in countries which are supposedly &quot;cheap&quot; to get not even the same quality. I find that the cost to maintain the same quality of life between different countries ends up being much more similar between countries than the statistics would have you believe.<p>I&#x27;m in a relatively poor country at the moment. On paper meat costs a fraction of what it does in the US, but what you get at the local market tastes absolutely terrible, uneatable to my spoiled western standards. I think they literally feed the animals trash. To get quality meat you need to go to specialty stores in the rich neighborhoods that caters to the country&#x27;s elite. There it&#x27;s actually about 10% more than what I pay at a US supermarket and it still is not as good. The same thing goes for housing, household goods, clothes, etc. In many countries you pay a huge premium for goods imported from the west, and the selection is often quite limited.<p>This has been my experience everywhere in the world. Excluding a few cities where you pay a premium just on the basis of the local job market, you more or less get what you pay for no matter where you go. The differences that don&#x27;t fit into spreadsheets are quite significant and almost fully account for the pricing differences from location to location.</div><br/><div id="42322359" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42322359" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jltsiren</span><span>|</span><a href="#42314987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321801">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42322914">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42322359">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42322359">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the common expat mistake.

Then there are a million little things you can&#x27;t change at any price; you can&#x27;t drink water from the tap even in my sparkling luxury apartment on the poshest block of the nicest city, and if I ever needed serious medical care I&#x27;d be on the first plane back to the US. There are tradeoffs everywhere but when you factor everything in including the overall quality of life in the city itself, prices are quite similar everywhere around the world...as you&#x27;d expect, since that&#x27;s how markets work.<p>My point is that the cost of things is more similar than people think, not what you should or should not buy as an individual, and that these adjusted PPP numbers do not make for valid comparisons. 99% of the time when PPP is used in the popular press someone is trying to bend the numbers to distort the real economic situation to try to further whatever narrative they&#x27;re pushing.

A faint metallic scent hung in the air. They tried to remember—who they were, where they were—but their mind was a void. Not a name, not a memory, not a fragment of identity surfaced.<p>A man in a gray suit entered the room, carrying a clipboard. &quot;You’re awake,&quot; he said with a calm yet clinical tone. &quot;No need to panic. The state of your memory is intentional.&quot;<p>&quot;Intentional?&quot; the person asked, voice cracking.<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the man replied. &quot;You’re participating in an experiment—a thought experiment, to be precise. You’ve been placed under the Veil of Ignorance.&quot;<p>&quot;The what?&quot;<p>&quot;The Veil of Ignorance,&quot; the man explained. &quot;It’s a framework proposed by philosopher John Rawls. You’ve forgotten everything about your past—your name, social status, skills, beliefs, and even your preferences. This ensures impartiality. Now, you’ll design the rules of the society in which you’ll live, unaware of who you’ll be once the veil is lifted.&quot;<p>&quot;But I don’t understand,&quot; they said, clutching the sterile sheets. &quot;Why me?&quot;<p>The man’s eyes softened. &quot;Imagine a world where no one is favored, where justice prevails because no one knows their position in life. You’re here to help build that world.&quot;<p>A holographic display flickered to life above the clipboard, showing a blank canvas labeled Foundational Principles.<p>&quot;Your task is to choose principles for society: how wealth is distributed, rights are allocated, and opportunities provided. Remember, once the veil is lifted, you could be anyone—a billionaire, a beggar, a politician, or a prisoner.&quot;<p>The enormity of the situation settled on them like a weight. They stared at the glowing screen. &quot;What if I make the wrong choices?&quot;<p>&quot;That’s the beauty of the Veil,&quot; the man said. &quot;You’ll choose fairness, because selfishness serves no one when you don’t know who you’ll become.&quot;<p>They hesitated, then began to think. If they could be anyone, they’d want a world where wealth wasn’t hoarded but shared. Where healthcare was a right, not a privilege. Where everyone, regardless of birth, had a shot at education, opportunity, and dignity.<p>With trembling hands, they input their principles:<p>1. Equal basic rights for all.<p>2. Fair equality of opportunity.<p>3. Redistribution favoring the least advantaged.<p>When they finished, the man smiled. &quot;You’ve done well. Shall we lift the veil?&quot;<p>Before they could answer, the room dissolved into a kaleidoscope of color and light. Memory and identity rushed back like a torrent.<p>They found themselves sitting in a modest apartment, a steaming mug of coffee on the table. Outside, children played in a clean park, and neighbors greeted each other warmly.<p>For a moment, they wondered: was it all a dream? Or had they truly built this fair and just world from behind the Veil of Ignorance?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42326014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42326014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dlkf</span><span>|</span><a href="#42324792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325167">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42326014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42326014">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If we did this fifty years ago, we’d be having this discussion by snail mail.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42325557" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42325557" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anon291</span><span>|</span><a href="#42324792">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42326014">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42325557">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42325557">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would have thought Khosla to be quite intelligent, but then he says this:<p>&gt; additions and exits from this group can also be tracked.

And the Fed can buy T-Bonds at below market rates and slowly destroy excess money in the economy in a controlled fashion.<p>Something to keep in mind is that US government debt is integral to the economy.

The only real risk is the potential for a default.  But even then, if you have $4 trillion dollars, what are you going to do with it instead of buying t-bonds?  Exchange it for Euros and risk the impacts of currency fluctuation?  And what will the buyers do with those dollars? At some point, someone is going to want to bank those dollars in savings, and that means buying t-bonds (directly, or indirectly), and the risk of default merely becomes a factor in an equation for the holder.</div><br/><div id="42322299" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42322299" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rich_sasha</span><span>|</span><a href="#42315200">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42321755">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42322299">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42322299">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can do all this at an accounting level. But ultimately US government is buying things with debt, ie paying for goods and services from third parties with an IOU, and can only do it if people think they are getting a good deal.<p>The way you get shafted with debt is inflation. Barely a few years ago bond yields were around 0. If you lent money to the government then, you&#x27;re already very behind because of inflation - you&#x27;re not getting any interest, and by the time you are repaid, the money is worth far less than before.<p>Furthermore, the Fed can&#x27;t really let interest rates diverge too much from inflation, since the mismatch drives inflation further. That&#x27;s why the rates are around 4% now, even as the economy is slowing. They have to be up to contain inflation.<p>So then, as the election was playing out, you could see bond yields fluctuating in line with inflation expectation. Whenever Trump said something that sounded inflationary, like tarrifs, bond yields jumped up. That&#x27;s not the Fed doing it, that&#x27;s lenders demanding more interest from the US govt.<p>Now I agree the US can get away with this more than other places.

And all over the thread you&#x27;ll find people arguing over nominal GDP versus PPP, but what&#x27;s not in doubt is that the balance of nominal GDP versus PPP is related to the strength of the dollar. Imports are vital to US industry — we thrive on buying less processed inputs from cheaper countries and producing high-value outputs.

That shale revolution has also come with big opportunity costs reductions, because the US didn&#x27;t have to geo-strategically care about the Middle East and the oil there all that much, at least not as much as to send real feet on the ground there, with all the associated costs.<p>With that said, there&#x27;s also the danger of the US following on Britain&#x27;s steps from the 1980s up until the 2000s, i.e. to rely on this shale&#x2F;oil bonanza and not care about (internal) structural reforms that are in dire need of being enacted. At some point the shale money will not be there anymore (the shale gas will have run out, the world&#x27;s car-fleet turns to electric en masse etc), and if the Americans don&#x27;t carry out the necessary reforms sooner rather than later then that future &quot;no more shale-gas money&quot; moment will come at a very, very bad time for them. I said it&#x27;s similar to Britain&#x27;s situation because things started going downhill there as soon as the North Sea oil&amp;gas money started thinning out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

1. Micromanage early and often
2. Measure, and whatever you&#x27;re measuring, act like it&#x27;s truth and that you know best.
3.

I&#x27;d rate him as better than average manager, who was surrounded by a lot of well under average managers.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear longer stories on your opinion here, because I have theories on the issues with Will&#x27;s advice, but nobody sees quite enough organizations to quite be certain. The more stories we hear, the more likely we are to get things right.<p>My hypothesis is that Will&#x27;s advice is a lot of recipes to create change in organizations, but lacks focus on when to apply them, and how to be sure you aren&#x27;t bungling it all up by fixing the wrong problem. This makes the ideas more attractive to the dashing, aggressive, confident executive, whether he has a good pulse on the problems, or he is the kind to trust on the wrong people, and fail to see that they are building enemies (as all agents of change do), without getting sufficient number of fans in the right places. So people that like his advice will tend to fail by overstepping. I know some executive who have an entire career like this, company after company: Seeing themselves as the protagonist of every story, and acting like bulls in a china shop, therefore failing politically even if their diagnosis was somehow right, and their changes made sense.<p>Ultimately the best advice is &#x27;make sure your manager likes you&#x27;. Which works just as well if you are a CTO reporting to a CEO, or an engineer reporting to a line manager. It&#x27;s trivially easy for executives to think this isn&#x27;t the case, and then be surprised when the reorg comes.</div><br/><div id="40532681" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532681" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roenxi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40529067">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532681">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532681">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; but lacks focus on when to apply them<p>The gap between theory and practice - tacit knowledge - is probably a factor here. It seems quite likely that a lot of <i>really good</i> managers in software have theories about why they are good managers. Those theories could all easily be wrong and they are actually experts at communication or weird technical details that happen to make great managers. A manager&#x27;s theoretical base is always built on a large tacit &quot;I know how to X, Y, Z in a social setting&quot;.<p>If we look at this article through a very abstract lens, software managing advice fits the pattern of &quot;at the appropriate moment, do the appropriate thing&quot;. Obviously the advice he gives is heavily tinged by the managers ability to identify the appropriate moment to do something unusual. He&#x27;s pointing out some times where the appropriate action seemed to be the counter-intuitive one, which is fair and interesting. But I wouldn&#x27;t <i>ever</i> trust a random manager to be able to pick the moment to do a counter-intuitive action; unless they were mentored with extreme care.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40531787" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531787" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atomicnumber3</span><span>|</span><a href="#40529067">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532681">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531721">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531787">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531787">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;make sure your manager likes you&quot;<p>This is always the best advice I&#x27;ve found.

The usual run off the mill micromanagement, that almost every terrible manager follows is what I call micro verification. Double guessing every step you take and adding a verification layer on top of it. In the long run, it erodes the confidence and risk taking abilities of employees and overall completely detrimental to a company.<p>Real micromanagement is the ability to dive in and solve unsolvable bugs or issues, rally the team until the minutest detail of an issue has been hashed out or remove any micro obstacle. Once a manager shows skin in the game and proves themselves, they often win the minds and hearts of all engineers, who then feel inspired to get into micro details themselves.<p>Now like a sleight of hand, you have scaled accountability and integrity in your team.<p>So micromanagement done in the right situation and in the spirit of moving things forward is highly beneficial. In most cases, however micromanagement devolves into this micro verification tool that every mediocre manager uses to justify their existence.</div><br/><div id="40532387" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532387" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DandyDev</span><span>|</span><a href="#40529067">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531465">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532387">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532387">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why is verification bad?

And crucially, you ask your team about their plan on how to get there. This still lets them decide on the “how”, while you can step in if you feel the plan is wrong.

Listen to the curmudgeons and the naysayers because they are the true sources of knowledge.<p>Theirs: &gt; “I’m a big believer in bringing folks into the room so that they can represent themselves rather than having small decision groups.

If you&#x27;re &quot;bringing everyone into the room&quot; to make engineering decisions then either you have a very small company, or you just treat all engineers as juniors (meshes well with constant micromanagement, of course).

</code></pre>
The lever isn&#x27;t people, we&#x27;ve known that one since the 70&#x27;s. But what we&#x27;ve learned over the past 15 years is that more quality, speed, and reliability through automation and shifting left, is a lever that works. A decade worth of DevOps reports show this to be true: the high performers do certain things, and the low performers don&#x27;t. If you do the things, you also start performing at a high level. But you have to actually do them, not just intone tech jargon and hope for the best, like so many ineffectual leaders have.<p><pre><code>  &gt; when you hear from your eng leaders that ‘Engineering is an art, and you can’t predict how it’s going to work,’ it’s frustrating. They’re sitting there thinking, ‘They’re telling me this is art, but I’m spending $100 million on this art each year.’ That’s not reassuring.”
</code></pre>
But you <i>can</i> predict how it&#x27;s going to work. It has barely been written down, and it is never really taught, but everything you need to know is out there. There&#x27;s no mystery to producing software products. Ask any veteran. The same stupid bullshit keeps happening, until you do certain things, and then the bullshit stops, and things start working better.<p><pre><code>  &gt; too many well-meaning engineering leaders go by the book of conventional leadership advice.
</code></pre>
Too many engineering leaders don&#x27;t understand that not all &quot;engineering&quot; is Engineering.<p>If you want to engineer a building or a brake caliper or something, that&#x27;s not art. You use math and science and engineering skills to design the thing to work, based on what is known to work and quantifiable and specific criteria.<p>But to actually <i>manufacture</i> the thing you engineered - quickly, effectively, without defects - <i>that</i> is a craft and an art.<p>There&#x27;s designing a thing, there&#x27;s building a thing, and there&#x27;s operating a thing. These are very different things, and require very different ways of working. Software people have this bizarre misconception that somehow they&#x27;re all the same thing, like some blob of random actions that they should intuitively know, and will execute flawlessly without any kind of enforced process or continuous improvment, and it should be easy, predictable, cheap, fast...... That&#x27;s not how the world works.<p>But I get it. Not everyone is a veteran who has seen and done all the things and knows the right way to do all the different things. The thing is, you don&#x27;t even need to know the right way to do things. What you <i>do</i> need to do is rely on data. Look at DORA metrics and the qualities of high-performing teams. Change how your org is working until those metrics improve. Continuously iterate on improvement, through process, experimentation, study, refinement. If you walk that walk (not just talk the talk), you <i>will</i> get improvement, predictability, value.<p>But you know how many engineering leaders I&#x27;ve seen actually walk the walk? One. And he got canned by political pressure because he was making other leaders look bad.</div><br/><div id="40529785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40529785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lifeisstillgood</span><span>|</span><a href="#40529555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40529681">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40529785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40529785">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From yourself and sibling comment I get three metrics that matter<p>- speed

We can look into whether that&#x27;s cheaper than just buying another book.<p>Either method is a huge improvement on this &quot;read two pages at a time&quot; business, in any case.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40528874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40528874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scrlk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40526818">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528674">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40528874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40528874">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If only there was an audiobook - listen to it at 2x speed. :^)</div><br/><div id="40532226" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532226" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esafak</span><span>|</span><a href="#40526818">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528874">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528922">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532226">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532226">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here is a ten minute summary: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;6EwppFDqNNyXIFZqbbITvt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;6EwppFDqNNyXIFZqbbITvt</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40528922" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40528922" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Scubabear68</span><span>|</span><a href="#40526818">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40530132">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40528922">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40528922">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a great article.<p>In particular, so many technical leaders work in a vacuum with no context.

Micromanagement Avoidance: Sometimes, engaging in details can prevent leaders from becoming bureaucrats and help in making informed decisions.<p>2. Flawed Metrics: Measuring something imperfect but useful is better than not measuring at all, helping to build intuition and understanding.<p>3. Umbrella Leadership: Shielding teams from external pressures can hinder their growth. Involving them in challenges builds resilience and better prepares them for the future.<p>These lessons are drawn from experiences at Stripe, Uber, and Carta.</div><br/><div id="40530958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40530958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">derwiki</span><span>|</span><a href="#40530132">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40530958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40530958">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks ChatGPT?</div><br/><div id="40531597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">darylteo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40530132">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40530958">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531597">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think top-comment was trying to save people a click?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

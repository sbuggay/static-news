A lot of managers refuse to understand the details of the systems and talk about how engineers need to provide &quot;executive&quot; summaries. This is the most bullshit argument I&#x27;ve ever heard. I spent many years at AWS, and one of my fav parts of working at AWS used to be Charlie Bell randomly picking Directors and Senior Management to answer basic reliability questions about their service. If they are unable to do that, they would be reprimanded infront of the entire organization. It was the perfect way to keep managers inline with the actual reality of their engineering organization.<p>AWS had many faults, but keeping managers honest was one of the good parts of working there.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36255104" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36255104" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">olivierduval</span><span>|</span><a href="#36254625">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36255058">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36255104">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36255104">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Actually, I think that it depends on your org level:<p>- if you&#x27;re a developer, then your manager is supposed to be available to manage you &quot;day-to-day&quot;... so if any problem arise, you can just ask him directly.

Big calls like a retro are incredibly useful but no matter how much people are comfortable with each other, due to size of the group alone, people won&#x27;t always truly speak their minds.<p>With 1:1s you have two humans speaking with each other, conversations naturally flow much better this way.

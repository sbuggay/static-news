For instance, even if we assume that your GenAI is properly sandboxed (and I&#x27;m not counting on early movers in the industry to ensure anything close to proper sandboxing), you could request one piece of statistics you&#x27;d like to display to your user, only to receive something entirely unrelated – and quite possibly something that, by law, you&#x27;re not allowed to use or display.<p>If we continue on the current trajectory, I suspect that it will take decades before we achieve anything like the necessary experience to write code that works without accident.

That the Best Seller list is a gamified black box is basically an open secret. The NYTBR, in particular, has become far too interconnected into the MFA-publishing-literature industrial complex. The reviews are so bland and milquetoasty <i>because</i> so much MFA-lit is bland as all hell and the reviews are just marketing.<p>The NYRB and the LRB are orders of magnitude better reading than the NYTBR, even if this article seems to criticize them (unfoundedly, in my opinion) as fuddy or old fashioned. They&#x27;re not traditional &quot;reviews&quot; in the sense that they usually don&#x27;t come around to saying whether a book is good or bad, though; they&#x27;re essays that use the books reviewed as launch vehicles for pushing the ideas in them into new directions or put under a new light. The NYTBR, in contrast, often reads as ad copy or toothless summary (the latter being the plague that has infected nearly all film criticism as well).<p>There has also been a big resurgence in smaller mags, like N+1 (now an elder statesmen of the new upstarts), The Drift, The European Review of Books (heavy focus on translation), and many others that have excellent, lively, criticism. Also subreddits like r&#x2F;truelit are a great way to expose yourself to new or interesting books. I usually find a book to add to my TBR list once or twice a week. Is the writing always up to par with professional publications? Not always, but sometimes it honestly is. (r&#x2F;truelit does have a strong slant towards formal experimentation, though, which some people aren&#x27;t a fan of. People more interested in &quot;the classics&quot; or contemporary-lit can find great recs still in r&#x2F;literature.)</div><br/><div id="40933077" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40933077" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jfim</span><span>|</span><a href="#40932744">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40932837">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40933077">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40933077">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In this context, what does MFA stand for?

You accepting the painting of the Mona Lisa as art tells something about you, while my grandfather rejecting it with the words &quot;my 7-year-old granddaughter can draw better&quot; tells something about him. This is inherently political. A modern art painting with color splashes is, in the most basic sense, not distinct from a 5-year-old playing with paint without context. With context, whether you accept it as art or not is political.<p>&gt; Politics is the set of activities associated with making decisions in groups or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status.<p>So even if you could argue that art itself is not political, you surely cannot argue that the perception of it isn&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40934650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40934650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sva_</span><span>|</span><a href="#40932744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40934579">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40934686">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933329">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40934650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40934650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your gracious political leaders have allowed you to sit on the beach and draw a picture, of course.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40933329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40933329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adolph</span><span>|</span><a href="#40932744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40932837">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933655">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40933329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40933329">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This always has something interesting with links to high quality discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernewsbooks.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernewsbooks.com&#x2F;</a><p>(Not affiliated, just an appreciator)</div><br/><div id="40933593" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40933593" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crossroadsguy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40932744">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933329">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40933593">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40933593">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Books recommended on hn are almost always books that are &quot;useful&quot; in the spirit of productivity and all that.

You&#x27;re looking for an opinionated review in a place where the writers are tasked with being objective, what you called &quot;8th grade summary&quot; style. I understand the desire and would prefer it myself, but a shift to opinionated reviews changes the game. The tastes of the reviewer are now front and center and whether or not you find the review valuable is dependent on how similar they are to your own. It&#x27;s hard to build a long-lasting brand when the tone becomes intertwined with the individual.<p>&gt; The dawn of the internet did not bring about a democratization of book reviews for the betterâlet us look again at Goodreads as an example of what can happen and then, quickly, look away. We still need critics to review publications that bring in intellectual and other histories while making judgments about books but without fetishizing books or authors.<p>In many ways I <i>thoroughly</i> enjoyed this section. It&#x27;s truly a blessing to watch an author undermine their entire argument so completely all at once. In a way I suppose it&#x27;s a compliment, Mr. Nair is so talented at arguing for a position that in a moment of distraction took a wrong turn into the contra and simply kept moving forward without skipping a beat. To build up such a strong foundation and then knock it down like a sandcastle is, if nothing else, entertaining. You&#x27;re there on the eve of battle inspired to charge in and destroy the ivory tower and evils that precipitated it only to find out the plan is to build a new one, but paint it eggshell this time. And it&#x27;s not as if eggshell isn&#x27;t an improvement, ivory is after all stilted and antiquated but-- perhaps we could make the new thing not quite as tall?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40932695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40932695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">janalsncm</span><span>|</span><a href="#40932798">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40932772">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40932695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40932695">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kind of strikes me as fighting over crumbs at this point.

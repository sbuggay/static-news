It seemed boring to me, I thought all I&#x27;d be doing was pushing numbers around...now I have a humanities degree (I don&#x27;t regret it one bit, I learned to appreciate everything beautiful in the world), but I&#x27;m finding myself growing interested in math once again, but in things like set theory and topology and the areas that seem to ask the questions of representation that I felt what was called &quot;STEM&quot; never addressed.<p>It&#x27;s not my fault! The author is right, things like mathematics, physic (in fact, nearly the whole of STEM, at this point) have been subordinated to the logic of &quot;rationality,&quot; instead of desire for beauty in the world and human creative effort. What kind of &quot;rationality&quot; builds a society of busybodies and functionaries of power whose only job is to perpetuate a norm of bureaucratic dictatorship, who only have the &quot;freedom&quot; to watch youtube and scroll tiktok after work. True freedom only comes with power, with willful, creative action. And we aren&#x27;t building a society that teaches kids to do anything but suppress their most natural tendencies for fear of total social alienation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35934136" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35934136" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jstrieb</span><span>|</span><a href="#35936016">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35934041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35934136">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35934136">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone who majored in math in college, this essay did an excellent job of communicating ideas that I&#x27;ve struggled to explain to family and friends who practically flinch when I tell them I studied math.<p>If you connected with this essay (or, perhaps, if you did not), I highly recommend checking out a book called <i>99 Variations on a Proof</i>, by Philip Ording.

The book has diagrams, though they are more like sketches you might see on a chalkboard or whiteboard in a lecture (e.g. a ray diagram, several rows of hand-drawn circles that are slightly uneven non-uniform sketches, and other geometric sketches, such as triangles inside of semicircles).<p>There are some nice abstract artistic illustrations at the start of each &quot;part&quot; of the book (and also the covers), though they are more for aesthetic decorations rather than for communicating mathematical concepts. For example, one of the illustrations is an abstract medieval-like artwork with a sun that has a human-like face, a starry sky, and a person in robes whose head is peeking through the starry sky to look at a world across the boundary. So, you won&#x27;t lose out on comprehension at all by reading the ebook, but the book does have some minor artwork only tangentially related to the book&#x27;s content, which might make a physical edition preferable for aesthetic&#x2F;collector&#x27;s purposes.<p>The e-version is perfectly fine, though; as the prologue states, the book was first published as part of an online column on the Mathematical Association of America&#x27;s website, so the e-version appears close to the original version. The prologue writer who helped publish the book also first received the essay as a 25-page printout from an audience member at a lecture.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35935400" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35935400" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">downvotetruth</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934041">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35934152">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35935400">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35935400">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I have no objection to a term like “right angle” if it is relevant to the problem and makes it easier to discuss.

Then, continued hard work and persistence can set you up for a strong career in mathematics, without necessarily being brilliant.<p>The perspectives shared there were quite interesting. There were quite a few users who have worked as professional mathematicians—some very successfully—who talked about how they didn&#x27;t really worry about whether they had mathematical talent, but just worked hard at their goals to become mathematicians because it&#x27;s what they wanted to do.<p>So, in many cases, it&#x27;s a valid approach to work hard at mathematics without worrying if you have enough mathematical talent, and eventually find challenging and interesting work along the way.<p>~~<p>Separately, there was an interesting Medium post discussed on Mathstodon and r&#x2F;math a while back, about a father encouraging curiosity for his daughter to learn about the definition of the derivative: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sunilsingh-42118.medium.com&#x2F;the-death-of-the-mathematics-i-knew-2255693c87cd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sunilsingh-42118.medium.com&#x2F;the-death-of-the-mathema...</a><p>I liked the second part of his essay more when he talks about his approach in encouraging intuition. He wrote about creating a sense of mystery by rolling a marble up and down a curve to introduce the idea of a tangent line and the concept of a slope, then got his daughter curious about finding ways to numerically calculate the slope.<p>I thought that was an interesting approach for kindling a innate motivation to learn mathematics for a person new to mathematics, rather than focusing on physics, engineering, or economics applications like many textbooks too. Though motivating students to learn calculus for applications can also be interesting (especially for different types of students), it&#x27;s a bit rarer to find ways for educators to motivate students to learn mathematics for the sake of itself, especially for students learning calculus for the first time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35934289" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35934289" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Buttons840</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35934815">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35936106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35934289">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35934289">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think I was good at easy math, and I refused to follow directions.

I think it’s weird that we don’t teach people to read music effectively as a regular part of musical instruction. Playing music is boring and mundane unless you’re good at it and becoming good first involves imitation. The most effective way at to imitate is to be able to read. I know everyone says there are loads of amazing guitarists who can’t read music but there are zero amazing guitarists who didn’t start by imitating someone else.<p>Why not give people the best way to imitate as a first step?<p>Music and maths are very similar in that they are as much a skill as they are an art form. You have to practise both regularly, you can’t cram for maths on the night before an exam and you can’t cram the night before a music recital.<p>I think music education should be more like mathematics but I also think that both should bring “big ideas” and outcomes into play sooner, with less emphasis on theory and more emphasis on practical implementation. In maths that means project based learning in music it means focusing on reading and practise rather than theory.</div><br/><div id="35934882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35934882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nohaydeprobleme</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934245">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35934330">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35934882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35934882">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You made an interesting observation, but in my personal experience, educators can help students by striking a balance between rigorous fundamentals and getting to improper-but-enjoyable interactions with a new skill, when teaching a new subject—if the student isn&#x27;t already strongly self-motivated.<p>My personal experience is with language learning, which might be comparable to focusing on sheet music and scales. When learning languages like Mandarin, Japanese, or Arabic, you can spend a lot of time focusing on fundamentals before getting started with how to say basic useful phrases (e.g. proper tones for Mandarin, and the alphabet system for Japanese and Arabic).<p>I spent more than a month learning the mundane fundamentals of tones in Mandarin before learning basic useful phrases. I was personally strongly convinced this was useful and was prepared for the mundanity, but I could easily see myself or other people quitting after spending several weeks without knowing more than a few phrases. With Arabic, too, I spent weeks with one teacher just focusing on the alphabet and how the letter shapes transform in certain letter combinations, without learning more than very basic phrases—which I appreciated, as the strong basis paid off down the line. Another teacher, however, spent about two-thirds of the time on phrases with romanization with English letters, and about a third of the time on the alphabet.<p>~~<p>For learners—especially adult students—already convinced about learning a subject, a mundane approach is acceptable because they already have the proper motivation to learn. But especially for younger students, perhaps it&#x27;s okay to spend a good amount of time having fun learning the subject—but not in a way that&#x27;s necessarily optimized for time.<p>For adolescents learning musical instruction, a better approach might be a split between theory and learning to play a simple but nice song without knowing how to read notes. But for already strongly-motivated students and&#x2F;or adults, a few weeks or even months on more mundane can be even preferable, especially if the student has volunteered to spend their time working through the mundanity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35934330" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35934330" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cammikebrown</span><span>|</span><a href="#35934245">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35934882">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35935389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35934330">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35934330">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reading music is absolutely something that most students of music learn.

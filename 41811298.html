I even have two at home, one a K2000 (MIPS) machine from the 90&#x27;s and an Itanium server from a the mid 10&#x27;s. I am pretty sure the suburbs lights dim when I fire them up :).<p>It&#x27;s an interesting machine architecture to work on, especially the &quot;Guardian 90&quot; personality, and quite amazing that you can run late 70&#x27;s based programs without a recompilation written for a CPU using TTL logic on a MIPS, Itanium or X86 CPU; not all of them mind you, and not if they were natively compiled. The note on Stratus was quite interesting for a long time the only real direct competitor Nonstop had in a real sense was Stratus. The other thing that makes these systems interesting is they have a unix like personality called &quot;OSS&quot; that allows you to run quite a bit of POSIX style unix programs.<p>My favourite nonstop story was in the big LA earthquake (89?) a friend of mine was working at a POS processor. When they returned to the building the Tandem machine was lying on its side, unplugged and still operating (these machines had their own battery backup). The righted it, plugged everything back in and the machine continued operating as though nothing happened. The fact that pretty much all the network comms were down kind of made this a moot point, but it was fascinating none the less. Pulling a CPU board, network board or disc controller or disc - all doable with no impact to transaction flow. The discs themselves were both mirrored and shadowed, which back in the day made these systems very expensive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41813941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41813941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#41817599">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41813431">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41813941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41813941">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Tandem was interesting. They had a lot of good ideas, many unusual today.<p>* Databases reside on raw disks.  There is no file system underneath the databases. If you want a flat file, it has to be in the database. Why? Because databases can be made with good reliability properties and made distributed and redundant.<p>* Processes can be moved from one machine to another. Much like the Xen hypervisor, which was a high point in that sort of thing.<p>* Hardware must have built in fault detection. Everything had ECC, parity, or duplication. 
It&#x27;s OK to fail, but not make mistakes. IBM mainframes still have this, but few microprocessors do, even though the necessary transistors would not be a high cost today. (It&#x27;s still hard to get ECC RAM on the desktop, even.)<p>* Most things are transactions. All persistent state is in the database. Think REST with CGI programs, but more efficient.
That&#x27;s what makes this work. A transaction either runs to successful completion, or fails and has no lasting effect.
Database transactions roll back on failures.<p>The Tandem concept lived on through several changes of ownership and hardware. Unfortunately, it ended up at HP in the Itanium era, where it seems to have died off.<p>It&#x27;s a good architecture. The back ends of banks still look much like that, because that&#x27;s where the money is.
But not many programmers think that way.</div><br/><div id="41817544" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41817544" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sylamore</span><span>|</span><a href="#41813941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41814542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41817544">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41817544">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Speaking of Tandem Databases, HP had released the SQL engine behind SQL&#x2F;MX[0] as open source (Trafodion) running in front of Hadoop to the Apache Software Foundation but it appears they have shutdown the project[1].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;sql-hadoop-database-trafodion-bridges-transactions-analysis-divide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;sql-hadoop-database-trafodion-bridges...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attic.apache.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;trafodion.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attic.apache.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;trafodion.html</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41814542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41814542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sillywalk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41813941">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817544">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41817049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41814542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41814542">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Databases reside on raw disks.

Either fails, then the hypervisor moves the (V)IP over with ARP to the running one and spawns another to replace it. More often than not, it&#x27;s a way to run a critical machine that cannot accept any downtime and cannot otherwise be (re)engineered in a conventional HA manner with other building-blocks.

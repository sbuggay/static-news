And thereby having my wants reinforce executive control so that I can do what I think that I should.

You wouldn&#x27;t say autism isn&#x27;t a disorder just because there are few autistic savants.<p>Also consider - ADHD is much more often present in highly intelligent people.

YMMV but it changed my life after 41 years of struggling with ADHD.</div><br/><div id="36993181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36993181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991784">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994732">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36993181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36993181">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  but is prescribed off-label as an ADHD med<p>Guanfacine is approved to treat ADHD in the United States and several other countries.<p>Technically, extended-release Guanfacine is approved because that&#x27;s what was used in the trials. The brand name is Intuniv and the generic is Guanfacine ER.<p>The generic guanfacine (non-ER) can also be used, though technically off label. The only difference is that it must be dosed twice a day instead of once a day and the absorption is different so you can&#x27;t do a 1:1 translation of your dose to the ER.<p>Now that Guanfacine ER is generic and cheap, you might want to consider it for once daily dosing.<p>The non-stimulant medications are very good, but require some patience to get started with. Too many people give up in the first week or month because the side effects haven&#x27;t settled yet. Straterra (Atomoxetine) is another one that can take 1-2 months for good efficacy. Clinical trials show the positive effects continue to build over the course of a year. Surprisingly, Atomoxetine has a lower relapse rate after discontinuation too, suggesting it might be making some long-term positive changes to the brain. This is a nice contrast to stimulants, where the patient becomes essentially dependent on the medication and can go through a protracted rebound if they ever have to discontinue.</div><br/><div id="36996606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36996606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ddmf</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36993181">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36996534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36996606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36996606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Started on atomoxetine in February - I was 47 - the difference it has made with regards to staying on task, and short term memory is staggering.

How exactly are you managing emotional state if not with medication? Ironically the only way I&#x27;ve managed my emotional state off medication is by conforming to outside demands and ignoring my individual desires&#x2F;motivations as much as possible.</div><br/><div id="36992294" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36992294" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">btilly</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992033">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991527">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36992294">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36992294">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An example of rejecting outside demands is seeking out work environments where I can cooperatively seek out tasks, rather than having someone try to order me to do what they want me to do. If I encounter someone who wants to order me around, I&#x27;ll ignore if possible. And if not possible, I&#x27;ll change jobs before complying.<p>Trying to do things because someone is pushing me to do them will result in my becoming resentful, and losing my ability to get into an effective state of flow. But enough places in tech provide enough flexibility that I&#x27;ve been able to find places where I can be productive. And, in a virtuous cycle, productivity can make all sorts of oddities acceptable in an employee.<p>As for emotional dysregulation, let me address that. ADHD is caused by weak executive function. People with ADHD are slow to realize that we SHOULD do X, and the SHOULD is fairly weak. Therefore it becomes hard to resist emotions telling us we want to do Y instead.<p>I have two tools to address that.<p>The first is that at a purely emotional level, I strive to be fairly balanced. I work to address things that cause me negative emotions, like resentment, so that I don&#x27;t have negative emotions to fight against.<p>The second is that I attach my &quot;shoulds&quot; to my understanding of what I actually want and care about. As a result the idea &quot;I should X&quot; is reinforced by a DESIRE to do X. And this emotional reinforcement makes it easy to do it.<p>Ironically, it is always easier to motivate myself in the short term with negative emotions. But the effect of doing so is a breakdown of the positive feedback loop that I&#x27;m using to maintain myself. Thus forcing myself only works for a limited time, and then falls apart.

Basically all of them should be dismissed out of hand.<p>Medication is fine, it helps a lot of people, even if it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. For some, the effect is quite profound, even life changing. It&#x27;s up to you, and anyone telling you it&#x27;s somehow wrong isn&#x27;t worth listening to.<p>As to AI, what I want is a LLM acting as a personal assistant fed from a database of all of my daily experiences. My brain isn&#x27;t that great at organizing and recalling data, so I want to take all of the data I receive and feed it into a machine that can organize and recall it for me. I want a digital copy of my brain that I can search through.<p>The AI can pick up from my conversations that I promised Bill the TPS reports at 4. Because I&#x27;m bad at remembering and actioning on things, it can pop an event into my schedule. Or it can pick up that I said I&#x27;d work on encabulator designs in six standups but there&#x27;s no reference in my commit history and nag me.<p>I could ask &quot;what do I know about encabulation&quot; and get every article I personally have read relating to mazelvanes and perfabulated amylite. Or &quot;what was that book I read one time about time traveling dogs&quot;, or &quot;what&#x27;s my sister in law&#x27;s favorite color?&quot;, or &quot;what did Kathy say last week about her kid&#x27;s audition?&quot;<p>Better yet, it could scan through conversations and guess that Alice wants fancy German chocolates for her birthday because she mentioned it 18 times.<p>There&#x27;s just some things my brain does badly at. Just part of the neurological lottery I guess. I want to make up for that by offloading cognitive effort onto a machine. That will massively improve my quality of life, which has the side effect of making me much, much more productive.<p>I feel like this is a more positive way to help ADHD people. It works <i>with</i> you to make up for the things you&#x27;re deficient at, rather than making you work harder to compensate. It&#x27;s actual helping and not &quot;you can do better&quot;<p>I think everyone could benefit from this type of thing, but right now I see enormous potential for actually helping ADHD and autistic people.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36993632" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36993632" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">callalex</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992957">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994061">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36993632">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36993632">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Based on my experiences on this forum and how my vote counts seem to go, it seems the majority of readers are not anti-medication, but the people who ARE tend to be highly vocal and combatative about it.

I also don’t use meditation.<p>Generally, I’ve noticed a lot of society has a vague anti-daily-medication-for-mental-health view. If you need it every day people tend to be against it. Part of it is that people seem to think you should learn how to cope (you should), which some people think as minimizing the disorder (which is bad). I’ve seen people mention that they don’t like how medication changes your personality (which can be very strong) or generally just don’t like the feeling of being on it.<p>I’m not a doctor, but ADHD medication can increase your risk of suicide and other severe mental health issues, so there is good health reasons not to take it unless you “need” to. Everyone just seems to have a different definition of “need”.<p>Personally, for me and my decision not to take it, I felt it was important to learn to live how my body wanted me to. I never liked how i felt on the medication, and i wanted to be myself. Society is very focused on productivity, which can be hard for someone with ADHD to fit into. I wanted to learn how to fit myself into the world, so I could “succeed” and live a happy life (whatever that meant) without having any dependencies. I didn’t want a missed pill one morning or a drug shortage to impart my ability to live my life. That might mean that I don’t have the career I wish I could have, and I won’t live by others’ definition of success, and maybe I have to make conscious changes to my routine.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36993224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36993224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lyapunova</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992957">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36994469">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36993224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36993224">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You only have to look as far as big social media to see proof of the damage that corporate motives can cause on the mental health of average internetizens.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36994469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36994469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jkhdigital</span><span>|</span><a href="#36992665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36993224">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36992949">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36994469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36994469">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah I tend to agree, my ADHD is an existential problem only because I have a family to support and it tends to disrupt the flow of income.

I applaud anyone who actually makes something and puts it out there.<p>That said, a lot of &quot;ADHD apps&quot; are todo lists and planning apps.  ADHD isn&#x27;t a disorder of planning, it&#x27;s a disorder of doing.  I can make realistic, specific, achievable plans as well as anyone else, but when it comes to doing the work it often just doesn&#x27;t happen. Literally yesterday I lost a freelance client purely due to my own procrastination.  I had a sensible plan and didn&#x27;t follow it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to just slam this app or other existing apps, so in an effort to be constructive here are some spaces that I think could be explored further to help people with ADHD:<p>* Smart speakers. I use them heavily and they are a great distraction free computing device. &quot;Fire and forget&quot; reminders are great. I have a smart speaker in every room and can set a reminder to do something in 30 minutes time without having to move, find a pen, pick up a phone or distract myself in any way.<p>* Emotional regulation.  ADHD means you are on a rollercoaster of emotions that you can&#x27;t regulate well. There are techniques for controlling them but when you are blinded with rage or bursting into tears you don&#x27;t remember.  Perhaps a device could constantly asses your emotional state and remind you of regulation techniques right when you need them.<p>* Anything centered around positivity and forgiveness.  An app that makes past successes visible without minimizing the impact of the disorder would be great.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36991823" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36991823" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThinkBeat</span><span>|</span><a href="#36994554">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991094">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36991823">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36991823">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a person with ADHD I hate these fancy high tech

Or at least I haven&#x27;t found a good way to manage its alerts in a helpful way.<p>For one, basically all alerts are the same.  Meaning there&#x27;s no good way to make noisy alerts for critical events and quiet ones for mundane things. You can set multiple alerts for an event, like 1 week before, 1 day before, etc. But it&#x27;s manual every time.<p>Something more like PagerDuty style alerts that let you set up classes of alert patterns would help. Alerts that blow up your phone until you get them would help. It&#x27;s so easy to have the calendar alerts go completely unnoticed with just a chime if your phone is in your pocket or in another room or if your alert volumes don&#x27;t happen to be perfect, which is pretty much impossible since background noise levels change throughout the day.<p>Even such minor things, like when you snooze an alert and you can configure it to notify X minutes before the event, if you select 0 minutes it <i>still</i> alerts the minute before the event which is enough time for me to get distracted again.<p>No, it&#x27;s one of my biggest disappointments of technology today is that such basic tools are so poor at their job and lack such straightforward configuration controls. The tools are made to work for Google, not for you.<p>So of course people are going to points loads of third party add ons, and hacks to get calendar to be marginally more useful, but WHY should we need to jump through hoops to make our devices serve some actual useful purpose for us?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36990616" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36990616" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jasoncurry</span><span>|</span><a href="#36991267">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36991655">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36990616">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36990616">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hi, we just started building a few weeks ago but have about 700 beta users.

Especially in open office spaces, which is the reason why I am never in those.<p>- if I am in an emotional state that does not allow me to work (mad&#x2F;sad&#x2F;bored&#x2F;angry&#x2F;overwhelmed), I need to find motivation to work with little and easy to fulfill tasks that have a low complexity in the scrum sense. Quick bug fixes, documentation tasks, writing tests etc.<p>- if I am in an emotional state where I can focus (happy&#x2F;excited&#x2F;motivated&#x2F;calm&#x2F;focussed&#x2F;hyperfocussed), I don&#x27;t want to be distracted by anything else. I am usually listening to music without vocals because of that, because vocals, alerts and notifications are distracting. This app&#x2F;extension does not respect that, and adds more to the sea of noise.<p>The reason I use VIM as an editor for more than 20 years, and around 10 years together with i3 is mostly because of notifications. GNOME 3 got better for that, but blinking windows and notification bubbles on systray icons are still notifications, and are still distracting, so I made my choice to move away from GNOME to i3 because of that.<p>With my current setup, I have zero notifications - for better or worse. The only app I allow in the systray is OpenSnitch (my firewall), anything else is not allowed to have a systray or background-running process. I avoid electron apps like the plague because of that, and I wrote helper scripts that automatically kill those apps when I close their windows. I even tried to submit a PR to upstream electron because of it, but nobody seems to care about this issue and they deleted it.<p>A lot of electron apps enforce their UI decisions upon to you, which means that the UI frameworks, if not allowed to run in systray, render shitty toasts on the active screen - even when they are on another virtual screen. So yeah, the UX of &quot;modern apps&quot; is horrible from my point of view, because they keep ignoring my decisions to not want notifications. This includes Thunderbird, Slack, Mattermost, Discord and especially everything from Microsoft, like Outlook, Office or Teams.<p>I cannot use Windows or MacOS because there&#x27;s literally hundreds of notifications, popups and dialogs that interrupt my workflow. In every single UI, from IDEs to even the goddamn GPU drivers that offer me promos, now even in the Start Menu. WTF.<p>At some point I tried to build a task planning app for myself to overcome mentioned issues with hyperfocus and external dependencies. I got it into a somewhat working state, but am out of ideas on how to make it more usable across multiple devices without having to have to host a web service that could add pitfalls. Would love to hear feedback if others like the idea, too.

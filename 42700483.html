(I&#x27;ve changed from calling it WFC to Model Synthesis; Paul Merrell earned the naming rights, unless we discover an even earlier description.)<p>I mentally divide it into two important components:<p>1. Cross-correlation  (the &#x27;wave function&#x27;)<p>2. Label selection (choosing where the &#x27;collapse&#x27; occurs)<p>The &quot;cross-correlation&quot; is exactly what it sounds like - given an incomplete model and a set of example patterns, this data structure represents the cross-correlation of every place that any of the patterns would individually fit in the incomplete model.  I think this is the most useful structure in the algorithm, and is a form of iterative &#x27;feature detection&#x27; over the incomplete model.<p>I think there are many interesting things which can be done with this which aren&#x27;t in the basic algorithm, such as:<p>- Having larger indivisible &#x27;patterns&#x27; and collapsing such patterns all at once.  Although example patterns are always broken down into discrete cells, larger patterns can exist where each cell gets a unique label and very limited transition set. The cross-correlation will detect where they can be placed, and if one is chosen the entire pattern could be chosen at once.<p>- <i>Partial</i> seeding of labels, e.g. selecting portions of the incomplete model and artificially limiting the available labels in that area, without collapsing it.<p>- Addition of information to labels which aren&#x27;t easily expressed in an example pattern, such as rudimentary counting of distances.<p>The &#x27;label selection&#x27; portion (in WFC terms, this is the algorithm used to choose which space to &#x27;collapse&#x27;) is where <i>all</i> of the random generation comes into play.  If using Model Synthesis for full world generation, <i>this</i> is what should be focused on for generating more interesting types of environments.<p>However, given the common label selection algorithms I&#x27;ve seen and used, I think that Model Synthesis excels mostly at adding small-scale, largely self-similar patterns onto constraints provided by a larger structure.  I think that other proc-gen methods better lend themselves to generating large-scale structures. A combination of the two - generating a large-scale structure to serve as a constraint, and allowing model synthesis to fill in interesting detail - seems like a good path to explore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42751679" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42751679" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jasonjmcghee</span><span>|</span><a href="#42753130">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749091">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42751679">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42751679">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think proc gen like this often falls victim to the 1000 bowls of oatmeal problem.<p>Unless things _feel_ different, it just feels same-y.<p>Some games handle this well (often through biomes with different rules and&#x2F;or special areas with different rules) and others (interestingly, often those that talk about how many billions of possibilities there are) are techniquely different...

The many caves in Skyrim start to feel the same after a while. You can often recognize the same assets over and over in very content-rich games. The total number of assets used in the article is tiny compared to what a production game would have. Procedural generation can&#x27;t be used as an excuse to do less work, or it just feels same-y. A game is still a ton of work; it&#x27;s just different work for different goals with procedural generation.<p>Generating a huge world is boring if you don&#x27;t have interesting objects to put in that world. Interesting objects are meaningless unless they&#x27;re connected to a story. Minecraft works because it&#x27;s a sandbox for you to invent your own stories, so the infinite world ends up getting filled by the player. If any element feels repetitive, the whole game will. If you wanted a fully procedural game, you need to figure out how to procedurally generate all the different aspects: story, characters, enemies, places, objects. It&#x27;s <i>more</i> work to do that well than to make a traditional game.

Novelty delights us in a backdrop of routineness, sameyness, same-old-same-old-ness. So in between interesting things, the thusly necessary slightly-&quot;duller&quot; in-between areas are to pace and prep and make one anticipate novelty &quot;hopefully almost just around the corner&quot;. Ideally it&#x27;s so spaced to appear just in time before the player resigns such hopes.<p>And so if you&#x27;re going to have slightly-duller &quot;filler areas&quot; (and let me posit that any real-world say forest (in a biome one has traversed before), without the physical air and smells and winds (or friends&#x2F;pets stringing along) is quickly &quot;proc-gen dull-ish&quot; within minutes — even in reality — or call it &quot;meditative&quot;&#x2F;calming) — so again, if you&#x27;re going to have slightly-duller &quot;filler areas&quot; just to connect and space apart the unique content things to good effect, then procedural placements&#x2F;scatterings&#x2F;variations are going to beat manual placement not just in &quot;effort time&quot; but because <i>manual</i> would swiftly look much <i>more</i> repetetive (being inevitably eventually effectively copy-paste driven) given the scale of environments under discussion, even if it would <i>not</i> take a human months of menial clickery.<p>Rockstar gets it right imho but their approach would also get  your &quot;many caves in Skyrim&quot; right because they manifest little novel uniquenesses not in scattered objects or env textures&#x2F;models but via lively interactive interludes, whether it&#x27;s animals frolicking or chasing each other or attacking towards you or &quot;random stranger&quot; incidents etc. That&#x27;s the right kind of &quot;filler but not boring&quot;, nobody cares about the variety of the rocks, only noticing them if nothing seems to be happening.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42752313" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42752313" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alhadrad</span><span>|</span><a href="#42751679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42751856">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42749091">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42752313">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42752313">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The interesting part comes with building a simulation on top of this.

Even the long-in-the-tooth &quot;just fire Perlin noise at varying levels of detail at the problem&quot; at least produces some overarching structure even if it is itself just random because the low-frequency, high-amplitude components you use will produce <i>some</i> sort of higher-level variation.<p>Literally <i>anything</i> with <i>any</i> hierarchy in it would be better, unless you&#x27;re really leaning into that SCP-esque, liminal-space creepiness. But if that isn&#x27;t your explicit goal I would definitely not recommend this for large-scale usage because in most projects that creepy liminal-space-ness is probably actively fighting your artistic goals.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even take that much; lay down some sort of street network with some other algorithm, a bit of &quot;zoning&quot; to switch some tile sets between &quot;residential&quot; and some other zone or even just a couple different types of &quot;residental&quot;, perlin noise it up if you&#x27;ve got no better ideas, then use &quot;wave function collapse&quot; (I <i>really</i> dislike the in-name-only &quot;quantumness&quot; of the name, can hardly call the algorithm that with a straight face) to fill in the blocks.

My implementation took almost 8h to generate a single map, and the result was not even good.<p>In the end, I used a combination of multiple techniques:<p><pre><code>  - voronoi to split the map into regions
  - use a noise function to make the regions boundaries a bit more natural
  - fill the map with water tiles, place randomly some island seeds
  - grow the islands from their seeds using a cellular automata
  - to create continents, simply put a lot of island seeds in the same area, to generate a bigger one
  - place mountains or rifts on region boundaries to simulate &quot;tectonic plates&quot;
  - generate a heat map (influenced by position of the north&#x2F;south poles and equator of the map), a humidity map (influenced by leftover ocean tiles), a height map (which is influenced by the already placed mountains&#x2F;rifts) using a noise function
  - using the previous heat&#x2F;humidity&#x2F;height maps, generate a wind map
  - using the wind map, modify the humidity map (wind carries humidity over the land)
</code></pre>
Then, choose randomly some tiles that fit some criteria to place biomes:<p><pre><code>  - desert on hot&#x2F;dry land
  - forest on temperate land
  - swamp on temperate&#x2F;wet land
  - jungle on hot&#x2F;wet land
  - ...
</code></pre>
Then a bunch of different cellular automata to grow the biomes naturally.<p>The result was quite nice, but it still wasn&#x27;t on par to the map gen in Civilization games.

However, it is now longer the WFC algorithm. The idea of the WFC algorithm is that it is limited to one-at-a-time iteration, this mathematically means that every element in the input communicates its full &quot;state&quot; to the output.<p>The parallel tiling is neat, and the resulting cross-boundary replacements are neat as well, but they are in no way WFC, and as a result will lack a lot of the positive properties of the original algorithm! This is a kind of procedural generation now that does approach the properties of WFC in the limit as the number of chunks and comparisons goes to infinity.<p>It is a great way to scale an approximate&#x2F;approximating WFC algorithm (and I&#x27;m a huge fan of the first post on this -- sent a video of results from it to someone just a month ago or so!), so it may end up being much more practical in use day-to-day due to the speed of chunk loading.<p>I do maintain that WFC looked a bit nicer and more natural due to the iterative collapse bit and the constraints out on it, it felt, very &quot;cohesive&quot;. I feel like some of that has been lost in the speedier chunk-based algorithm (i.e. the entropy of the generations is much lower), but, this doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not as useful or anything like that. Just a tradeoff for parallel computation (and I&#x27;d call it something like &quot;approximate WFC&quot; or &quot;pre-baked approx WFC&quot; or the like just for clarity&#x27;s sake).<p>In any case, good work and I appreciate the problem solving skills and especially a lot of the hard problem solves like the heightmap differences and such.

You _cannot_ scale phone service or television or radio the same way.  There are simple limits on physical space and on carrier allocations that require there to be a licensing body.  The FCC is required to be reasonable and non-discriminatory and broadcasters are required to serve their local communities directly.  The FCC can only license broadcasters and can place no limits on receivers at all.  This is because these airwaves collectively belong to the people.<p>It was created to serve these purposes.

But it has picked up the pace since the arrival in 2017 of the first of three justices appointed by President Donald J. Trump.

In the era of Chevron Deference, court precedent was that in the face of ambiguity, the courts were to trust the unelected administrative agencies in their interpretation of statutes.

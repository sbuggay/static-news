Math not so much. She’ll gladly play Roblox every day with no assistance or structure from me. Math? That’s about as easy to form a habit with as running 5 miles. How do I get her to love math (or other good things) in the first place?<p>The hard part isn’t getting by kids to do things they love,  it’s getting them to do things they DON’T love.<p>I was able to get her hooked on reading actual paper books but only when she messed up in school and lost access to devices for 9 days. Boredom took over and books were the answer.

Just like our brains cannot tell the difference between a picture of a girl that doesn&#x27;t exist and a girl that does and both evoke some feelings of attraction, or an image of a wild animal that couldn&#x27;t possible exist and one who does and both evoke some feelings of fear, the same happens when we get upvotes on reddit or platinum rank in Call of Duty.<p>In healthy and balanced scenarios both are distractions in our free time. For people whose life situation is less than ideal those same tools exploit their need to be appreciated and rewarded, in return for profits from sales or&#x2F;and advertisements.<p>And we&#x27;re all pretending that these people just lack willpower, and if only they had willpower they could break away from the software whose parts are deliberately designed after consultation with psychologists specialized in behavioral addiction.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39355749" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39355749" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sureglymop</span><span>|</span><a href="#39354983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39355553">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39355157">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39355749">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39355749">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This may be just an insignificant anecdote, but as a gen-z person, what helped me as a kid was a sense of community. In my case specifically our parents bought us ipod touches and that sense of community was the early jailbreak community. It didn&#x27;t get me into math but into computer science which got me into math.<p>But this could extend to many things, e.g. the kid who likes Minecraft may get into &quot;logic puzzles&quot; through red stone while the kid who likes Roblox may get into creating roblox games.<p>Then, they will get into math once they actually need math as something useful for their &quot;logic based hobby&quot; as I will call it. Of course it is very hard when a kid is just hit with theoretical math and there is no real association with something they are already interested in. But there are actually countless associations, now you just need to find them and bridge your kids interests with math through them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39355157" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39355157" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rtodea</span><span>|</span><a href="#39354983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39355749">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39355290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39355157">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39355157">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We love the things that we are good at.<p>If you start with easy math problems (but not labelling them as &quot;math problems&quot;, but as logic, smart puzzles) you can build up from there.<p>Consistency and frugality of options is important.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39355290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39355290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mbork_pl</span><span>|</span><a href="#39354983">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39355157">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39355164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39355290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39355290">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re right, but this is a different problem.

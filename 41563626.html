And by process of elimination, we can deduce that the innocent starship crewmembers being attacked by facehuggers (novels) are innocent readers.<p>The metaphor actually contradicts the author&#x27;s main thesis, since every egg (writer) does in fact contain a facehugger (novel).  But contrariwise, all the human characters (the rest of us) would be much better off if those novels just stayed inside the writers and didn&#x27;t insist on being written or read.<p>Metaphors are like scissors; they&#x27;re twice as much fun when you run with them!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41565258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41565258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hengheng</span><span>|</span><a href="#41565267">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41564442">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41565258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41565258">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve once talked to a semi-successful author. His day job was Mechanical Engineering at the local university. He eventually quit once he had his formula worked out.<p>He writes crime novels. Doesn&#x27;t even like them, but if you want to sell, you either write smut (big gamble) or crime novels (less crowded). Anything you actually want to write about, you have to shoehorn into the crime novel. You also have to keep your protagonists whether you like them or not, or else every book will be your first one.<p>He also found that he had to write <i>local</i> novels that take place around the local tourist sights. He couldn&#x27;t write about his actual hometown of course, but there is a touristy spot an hour&#x27;s drive from him, so that&#x27;s where the detective had to be based for every single adventure. The touristy area must also be a city. That way you have half a million inhabitants, and the same amount of tourists whose relatives are looking for gifts.<p>He was basically playing bookstore SEO.<p>Unsurprisingly, being an ME, he had a product lifecycle. He was working on several books at once in a pipelined fashion. One was being drafted, the next one was being written, the third one was in early proof reading, the fourth one was being finalized. That way he had a good balance between creative and menial work <i>at all times</i>. He also explained how he was careful to use few proofreaders in the early stages, because apparently, his work is a dire read before any corrections. He has a process where he rotates through his early stage proofreaders, and mostly gives them later stage work that is more readable.<p>Being a successful author is no more romantic than being a successful programmer. Or painter. Or mathematician. Any romanticism is at odds with professionalism, e.g. <i>what works</i>. And that&#x27;s the same across all these professions.</div><br/><div id="41565293" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41565293" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dr_dshiv</span><span>|</span><a href="#41565258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41565293">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41565293">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Anything you actually want to write about, you have to shoehorn into the crime novel.<p>Isaac Asimov figured that out!</div><br/><div id="41565772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41565772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beacon294</span><span>|</span><a href="#41565258">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565293">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565481">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41565772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41565772">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What do you mean?

I published a book last year and it has been a long journey. It took me one year and a half to write it. But then when you think it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s just a second challenge coming up.
I wanted to write a book that was as straight-to-the-point as possible. The publisher I signed with didn&#x27;t really understand my approach and wanted me to turn it into a random book (&quot;less rough&quot;) where you would get the usual long and useless introductions that I hate. Took me a while to realise that if I signed with a publisher it was just to get this &quot;I&#x27;m an author&quot; recognition this article talks about. I realised I didn&#x27;t even buy &quot;regular&quot; programming books and most of my library are self published books. I didn&#x27;t want to publish a book I would have not read.<p>Ended up cancelling my contract and publishing it myself. I talk a bit about it in this article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.einenlum.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;my-book-from-php-to-python-is-out" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.einenlum.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;my-book-from-php-to-python...</a><p>I sold like 50 of them but got great feedback. To anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth it financially, definitely NOT. Is it still worth it for other reasons? I would say I don&#x27;t regret it but you first have to realise you&#x27;ll go into a rabbit hole and experience the levels of stress the author of the article talks about.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41564690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41564690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coolThingsFirst</span><span>|</span><a href="#41565050">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565178">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41564690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41564690">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I always find it very interesting when smart people mistakenly exaggerate how difficult it is to achieve something.<p>Pro bodybuilder is hard to become but it&#x27;s very likely that with once to once every 10 days in the gym is going to transform the average person into a monster.<p>Funny how we can make assumptions about life which are totally wrong.

The following passage is I think the most interesting:<p>&gt; Now of course, there is a second kind of author: authors who write books with little discernible impact on their newsletter or blog. They sit down for an hour (statistically, in the morning), pound out their quota, and turn to the next task. The book does not weigh on their minds, and they are confident that they will have it out, as usual, in 12 months. More power to them—but I also think that most would-be book authors already know if they are one of that latter kind of writers, or if they are the former kind I’ve been discussing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41564484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41564484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hyperbrainer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41565113">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41564706">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41564484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41564484">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">See, I am torn on this article.

Certainly a certain kind of bodybuilding body is absurdly difficult to achieve and I simply don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone - and every single person I know that&#x27;s achieved it has body dysmporphia and is driven by it. Not worth. But achieving something &quot;like&quot; a bodybuilder&#x27;s body is, imo, achievable for most people with the same amount of effort as most of the things people dream about - learning a language, learning to code, having an active blog, reading a book a month, etc. A few hours effort a week consistently and you&#x27;ll likely have great results after a year, and the journey never ends from there!<p>Mandarin as well is a more than achievable goal that can be achieved with a great degree of skill with a few years of consistent effort.<p>I think this article is right though - a book will kill other goals and activities if you don&#x27;t maintain a balance. I have many different thoughts about this that one day I&#x27;ll organize, hah, into a blog post. But my thinking is basically along these lines:<p>1. The 40 hour workweek is the wrong way to approach maximizing human productivity<p>2. Humans are inconsistently productive<p>3. Guardrails are necessary to achieve productivity<p>4. Consistency is probably the most important guardrail<p>5. The hardest part of doing a thing isn&#x27;t doing it, it&#x27;s scheduling it accurately, and sticking to the schedule<p>If a person maintains a fun blog incidentally alongside their work, blitzing out an article here and there as the whim strikes them, they might appear quite productive. However in an office setting, a corporation would find their productivity schedule infuriating - when will the thing be done? Idk, when I feel like it? When the mood strikes me? Leave me alone, I&#x27;m reading hacker news until the mood strikes me. Hence the inconsistently productive.<p>I&#x27;m not making a naturalist argument though - I want to be more productive than &quot;when the mood strikes me,&quot; and I don&#x27;t mean for just capitalist endeavors, I mean for all the various activist activities I want to do as well. However I think the modern trap is thinking that the way to be productive is to set hours for activities - 40 hours for work, 9-5. Lots of work done then, right?<p>Instead I think it&#x27;s better to combine scheduling time <i>with</i> an understanding of human motivation as something flexible and malleable. Most workout advocates will advise things like going to the gym every day 8am, and achieving this by making putting on your gym shorts the first thing you do when you get out of bed, engaging a Habit process, and I think this is effective. But for me what&#x27;s been more effective is, the night before, determining what time I&#x27;m going to bed, and then setting my alarm 8 hours after that, and then noticing - oh wait, I have a meeting 20 minutes after I wake up, ok, in that case, I put my gym shorts next to my computer chair, and immediately after the meeting put them on and <i>then</i> go to the gym, because 2 hours after that I have another call. Or, it&#x27;s 2am and I&#x27;m drunk, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to do anything but puke my guts out if I try to go on a run in 8 hours, I&#x27;ll schedule a nighttime run instead - or fuck it,  it&#x27;s the weekend, I&#x27;ll relax instead and acknowledge it&#x27;s just not happening tomorrow, but that&#x27;s ok because I have another go scheduled on Monday morning.<p>There&#x27;s another side to that which is accurate scheduling. Writing a book takes a long time and I think if it was slotted into a life correctly it would take years to write the book, when most want it done within a year or at most 2. But to achieve that they&#x27;d need to spend all their free time on it which would kill their blog hobby or whatever else. If I accurately measure out all the things I want to do in life - blogging, language study, reading, working out, riding my motorcycle, making videos showing off how beautiful taiwan is, fighting car capitalism, continuing to develop myself as an engineer, making enough money to retire - boy do I get depressed... I can do maybe 4 of those things before a week&#x27;s time is spent already. It&#x27;s hard to schedule things across the months, year, years, and not feel sad imo.<p>Also total sidenote but I think most non fiction books are way too long anyway and would work better as blogs and blog posts, and I think the market dynamics of bookselling pushes this tendency - excluding fields like academia where people are writing to include as much supporting material as possible and with the expectation of being quoted and cited extensively in future works by themselves or other authors, which with the merging of popular culture and academia is causing issues. See: &quot;Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity&quot; as an example. A really incredible new view of history and anthropology that&#x27;s imo inaccessible to most readers because it&#x27;s also at least partially written for academia.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41564331" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41564331" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">__mharrison__</span><span>|</span><a href="#41564826">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41564331">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41564331">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you want to write a book wrote one (out two or three).

Still, in the strictest real estate sense, my best and highest use is as a dishwasher.<p>I was managing a small optics factory in Livermore. We made laser mirrors to order there — any wavelength, any reflectivity, any angle, any polarization, you name it. I was working my ass off and was unmarried at the time. Thanksgiving came around and I had nowhere to go. But I hooked up with a church in San Jose that had a dinner for poor people and went as a volunteer. After serving the dinner, I wandered back into the dish room. I immediately went over to the sink and kicked out the lady who was pretending to work. I then washed all the dishes and left.<p>Comes one year later.  I’m in the exact same situation.  I call up that church.  The lady says, “Oh, that’s very nice of you.  But we don’t need any more volunteers, we have enough.”  Oh shit.  What to do.  I found my old replica army parka I had bought in a Cambridge surplus store 20 years earlier. I went as a poor person. I didn’t want to be alone.<p>The first thing I found out is that poor people are herded, controlled, treated like children. We had to wait outside the church in the mild cold until permitted to enter, in a kind of line. So I sit down.  I will never forget the beatific smiles of the volunteers that served us.  This was performance art, and they were the stars.  Everyone on the supplicant end noticed this, I’m sure. So the meal ends. I walk back into the dish room, survey the situation, once again kick out whoever was pretending to do the dishes, do the dishes, and leave.</div><br/><div id="41386278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41386278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">faeriechangling</span><span>|</span><a href="#41382859">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41383600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41386278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41386278">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Everyone on the supplicant end noticed this<p>I’ve downright gotten philosophical about it.

If you’re in a desperate situation you use the resources you have in front of you, and even say whatever it takes for them to help you more.  I just don’t trust their motivations as people who “help the disadvantaged” can have INSANE saviour complexes and hurt those around them so they can heal them.  Because they don’t actually care about you - they care about saving and being seen saving.<p>You’re perceptive to have caught on to the game so quickly.

Monopolies are absolutely awful, and that applies to unions too.<p>&gt;So if you want to join a company and enjoy the benefits that a union has fought for without contributing to their continued push for better conditions, you are a parasite and their enemy, and they are justified in locking you out of that job via collective action.<p>That&#x27;s a really bizarre quirk of US mindset.  So what if someone else gets the benefits of a better working conditions?  Great for them, that&#x27;s a fellow human being who&#x27;s life now doesn&#x27;t suck quite so much.  That should be celebrated.<p>If better working conditions is the only value the union provides you, your union sucks.<p>I&#x27;ve joined unions in the past because of the access to all the other stuff that they can provide, like free legal support, representation in disciplinary situations etc, just as much as working conditions.</div><br/><div id="41383555" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41383555" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacoblambda</span><span>|</span><a href="#41380640">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41383175">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41384006">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41383555">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41383555">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; That&#x27;s a very US centric view<p>It is of course however it can be argued that the US is somewhat of a unique case here.<p>To quote wikipedia (which itself is citing three other sources in this quote&#x27;s case)<p>&gt; According to labor historians, the US has the most violent labor history of any industrialized nation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_history_of_the_United_States#Analysis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_history_of_the_United_St...</a><p>So the US has a bit of a unique history here.

While human labor certainly can create value, it can also destroy value, so simply measuring human labor in terms of hours cannot reflect the actual usefulness that time provided. Hitting a bike in random places with a hammer for eight hours does not produce a more valuable bike; it probably destroys the bike, and no sane person would pay a higher price for that bike. This is one of the most fundamental flaws of communist economic systems.<p>Contrast this with the capitalist definition of value, which is simply to measure the price one is willing to pay for a good. If the price a consumer is willing to pay exceeds the price for which a seller is willing to sell, then you have a mutually beneficial exchange. Only time will tell whether or not the seller or buyer will actually benefit, but numerous experiments throughout history have shown this to trend upward in terms of improving the standard of living for the poorest in society.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41379631" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41379631" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FredPret</span><span>|</span><a href="#41378805">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41379471">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380133">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41379253">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41379631">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41379631">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m quite disappointed that you&#x27;re willing to lift your ideas wholesale from a French communist [0] unless of course by &quot;Capital&quot; you mean &quot;Das Kapital&quot; in which case it&#x27;s the original, German one [1].<p>Perhaps you should broaden your horizons and read up on the theory of people who disagree with you.<p>Specifically:<p>&gt; The dish, obviously.

However:<p>- The decoupling is not equal for all the countries examined. For the US, wages as a fraction of GDP has been roughly steady, declining from 49% in 1942 to 43% today [0]<p>- We&#x27;re going through major demographic changes - we have two huge cohorts in the boomers and the millennials entering different life stages in huge numbers. We&#x27;re also living much longer. This will mess with asset prices and wages in weird ways. Lots of old people holding on to their assets much longer than before, and lots more young people entering the workforce all at once.<p>- Some of the above issues are getting straightened out. Millennials were behind in wealth creation for a very long time, but for the first time are ahead and are now on our way to become the richest generation in history.

This is just the concept of Buffet&#x27;s &quot;moat&quot; broadened to apply to the rest of society rather than a market segment.<p>&gt; Real-life rich people invest their capital in (hopefully) productive enterprises. If they do a bad job, their wealth gets reassigned to savvier investors.<p>&quot;Productive&quot; is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. What actually might provide value to society and what might generate returns are wildly different things and are often diametrically opposed. Actual democratic control over the economy would yield a very different society than the one we live in, and it&#x27;s very difficult to see how a capital-driven society doesn&#x27;t create poverty and the long laundry list of associated evils (homelessness, illiteracy, substance abuse, widespread mental health issues, malnutrition, violence, etc etc).<p>Not to mention—more relevantly to our discussion here—technology&#x27;s potential is woefully, woefully, woefully hamstrung by our insistence on using it to extract wealth from each other. Imagine what a smartphone could be capable of if it wasn&#x27;t viewed as a profit center well outside the control of its users. Imagine what kind of internet we could have if people weren&#x27;t obligated to sell ads to keep it running. Etc. This devotion to the &quot;free market&quot; (as if such a thing could actually exist outside of a textbook) has destroyed liberals&#x27; ability to imagine humanity&#x27;s actual potential, and the demand for continual returns creeps into all our lives in the form of lower quality products, constant ads, drowning in plastic waste and roasting all summer. If the market is going to course-correct towards rational use of resources I have no clue what this would even look like.<p>&gt; A common example of people trying to hoard wealth is homeowners who interfere with the free market by blocking new construction. This is going to work out great for them... until it doesn&#x27;t.<p>The best way to make this argument will be to show when this fails (as it does, occasionally, do). Currently it&#x27;s really only failing where global warming is literally washing real estate out to sea. Judging by who owns the real estate in this country—mostly, the richest generation to ever have existed and very possibly to ever exist—being a NIMBY is evidently a great way to grow your wealth. Crassus was known for making money by withholding his firemen from burning buildings until they handed the deed over. Joe Manchin&#x27;s daughter makes money by exploiting an insulin monopoly at insane profit margins while people regularly have to choose between food, insulin, and rent. Etc. Markets are only able to correct these dynamics over the long term, much longer term than a human life. Hell, some of Europe&#x27;s aristocracy are <i>still</i> clinging on to money and power that their family acquired a millennium ago for reasons completely lost to memory, and the &quot;failures&quot; famous in European history occur over <i>centuries</i> (e.g. see the Fugger family). The easiest way to make wealth is to already be wealthy.<p>&gt; As another example of capital reallocation, if you&#x27;re earning good money by working for an pre-revenue startup, you&#x27;re enjoying the process of capital getting reassigned to you.<p>Of course! Trying to pass down what money I can is certainly why I took the job over, say, being a dishwasher. However, this is not an opportunity for most folks, and by any definition of making this an opportunity for everyone (not just a subset of society) is directly contradictory to the fundamentals of investment, which relies solely on using wealth inequality to drive productivity increases.<p>Look, all I&#x27;m saying is that investment is really useful for driving economic improvements... until it&#x27;s not, at which point whatever service the invested-in thing provides should be nationalized and run at zero margin to avoid inevitable enshittification. I strongly, strongly recommend reading Schumpeter. For being the father of our industry I&#x27;m flabbergasted with how few people actually read him. It&#x27;s easy to look at the 20th century and confuse the economic boom that came with industrialization and exploitation of virgin frontiers with the natural course of market forces, but the latter is coming to a close.

Given the markets inability to honor human dignity I suggest regulating this part of it by mandating a minimum wage that is a living wage and keep that wage updated at least on a yearly basis. Not a radical thing to demand.<p>A real job is one that allows you to lead a dignified life. Being okay with essential jobs being paid below that wage is a problematic stance to take for various reasons and comes across as an egoistic stance to me (e.g. imagine someone saying: &quot;While I enjoy cheap and good coffee, I don&#x27;t want the batista who made it to afford to live off it.&quot;)<p>There are not many reasons to say that, but all of them are to some degree egoistic. You might be a star bucks manager that makes a good living off your workers earning less. You might be a customer that wants to pay as little as possible and is okay to ignore the exploitation. Or you might think this is market logic and go like &quot;they simply have to find another job&quot; (thus admitting it is not a real job anybody should expect to live from).<p>Now my stance — just like yours if I got that right — is that all jobs are real jobs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41380643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41380643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thisislife2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41378805">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41379618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380022">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41381476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41380643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41380643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A really long time ago, I had once visited a police station in Tamil Nadu (India). One of the lower level officials there had the rank &quot;SSI&quot;. I was perplexed as I had never heard of this rank before. So I asked the Inspector about it. He said it stood for &quot;Special Sub Inspector&quot;. He then smiled and added, &quot;There was some court case involving some government official or union who complained about not being promoted even after serving for many years in the same post. The court ultimately ruled that was unfair, and said even if an official doesn&#x27;t get promoted by virtue of merits, their experience also matters. Thus, any official who serves a certain number of years (I think it was 5-10 years or so), and doesn&#x27;t get a promotion on merit during those years, should automatically be promoted by virtue of their experience. Ofcourse, some government bureaucrat in the Tamil Nadu civil service and police service weren&#x27;t happy with this ruling as police officials who don&#x27;t get promoted don&#x27;t because they are either corrupt and &#x2F; or incompetent. Thus, the government created a new rank (in between the ranks of Head Constable and Assistant Sub Inspector) to &quot;comply&quot; with the court ruling but cheekily called it &quot;Special Sub Inspector&quot; to convey their own disagreement with the ruling.&quot;<p>It was funny but it did make me think - Perhaps in the mid-levels, experience can compensate for the lack of special skills or motivations as an employee will know enough to do his immediate superior&#x27;s job &quot;well enough&quot; (average or slightly below average) too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41381476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41381476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Talanes</span><span>|</span><a href="#41378805">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41379618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380643">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41379572">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41381476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41381476">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That 5+ year grocery store stocker is the lynchpin that allows them to quickly hire teenagers who are only going to work there for a year at most before moving on.

I was a dishwasher (and everything else) at your standard suburban Italian deli for a couple years in high school. Italian delis are famous for their cold deli sandwiches, but also for things like bacon, egg and cheeses for the breakfast crowd, and chicken cutlet, chicken parm, sausage and pepper, meatball, etc. sandwiches for lunch. And the great thing about it is that these things, historically anyway, are cooked on-site, starting first thing in the morning, using your standard baking sheets&#x2F;pots&#x2F;pans, which (surprise) creates a lot of dishes each day.<p>Now this deli I worked at had no machine so all those pots and pans stack up and by afternoon, when the cooking is done, there&#x27;s a huge stack of dirty dishes. My first day working there, I show up after school and since they know I&#x27;m coming there&#x27;s the huge stack of dishes waiting for me, the new guy. They tell me to get cracking on it and so I don the apron and get going. This is maybe at 2pm.<p>As I&#x27;m working away, folks periodically check in with me, kind of with these quizzical looks, but they don&#x27;t really say anything other than an &quot;all good?&quot; type of vibe. And I&#x27;m sweating my ass off because the amount of char&#x2F;build up on these stainless steel pans&#x2F;pots&#x2F;etc. is off the charts. But I&#x27;m diligently working away getting them absolutely friggin&#x27; spotless! Like restoring them back to their brand-new state.<p>Well, you see where this is going. The guy who got me the job, a friend who&#x27;s also a high school guy but a bit older, comes in the back, as I&#x27;m finishing up, maybe 4 or 5 hours later. The two owners of the deli also come around the corner. My friend&#x27;s like &quot;dude, those have never looked like that,&quot; pointing at the huge stack of cleaned pots and pans. And I&#x27;m like &quot;whattaya mean?&quot; And he&#x27;s like &quot;all of that black stuff? Just stays on there!&quot; I&#x27;d literally cleaned off years of charring that had built up. He slaps me on the back, starts laughing his ass off. One of the two owners, when he stopped laughing, was like &quot;I didn&#x27;t know why the hell it was taking you so long but... they look great!&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="41382608" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41382608" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway20222</span><span>|</span><a href="#41383532">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41382608">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41382608">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I kept my dishwashing job on my resume for far too long under the title “hydro ceramics engineer.”<p>It was grueling work, but I met a lot of interesting people, one in particular turned me on to studying Chinese which changed the whole path of my life.

If tipped employee compensation was actually about compensating those folks for their effort, they should received the tips they earn. (Tipped minimum wage gets increased to standard minimum wage if you earn fewer than the difference in tips—which is functionally identical to having $5 and a bit of your tips withheld every hour)<p>As it stands today, if you&#x27;re tipped and you work a shift where there are fewer customers, you implicitly get paid less (and have more of your tips soaked up by your employer) for exactly the same amount of effort. If you work a graveyard shift for eight hours and see $40 in tips from eight customers, you effectively worked minimum wage with $0 in tips, not minimum wage plus $40. For the people working those jobs, that&#x27;s multiple meals or tank of gas.<p>There&#x27;s no practical reason for having a lower minimum wage for tipped employees, it&#x27;s literally just an excuse for employers to pay their tipped employees less. If we as a society <i>actually</i> believed that some professions should be compensated based on effort, there would be a different minimum wage for people compensated by commission. But that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>So to answer your question, you&#x27;re not necessarily &quot;directly compensating&quot; the employee, because a non-trivial percentage of your tip goes towards subsidizing their employer.</div><br/><div id="41381810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41381810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CalRobert</span><span>|</span><a href="#41379901">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380735">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41381810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41381810">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This varies by state, though.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41380271" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41380271" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">liotier</span><span>|</span><a href="#41379901">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380044">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380258">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41380224">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41380271">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41380271">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; No, tipping is a way of directly compensating people who are directly doing work for you<p>From a European point of view, this is ludicrous.

I can relate, I spent a high-school summer dishwashing at a hotel, pretty much my first full-time job, and learned what hard work and long hours actually meant - 6:00 (breakfast) - 24:00 or sometimes later, albeit with breaks between serving times.<p>Any reasonably-sized restaurant needs a dishwashing machine of some kind though, eg a conveyor - I don&#x27;t see anything in those photos.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41382986" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41382986" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eat_the_rich</span><span>|</span><a href="#41379333">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41384438">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41382986">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41382986">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Starting at the bottom and working your way up to the top definitely produces a different quality of leader.

Relatively few companies ever made it work, and it&#x27;s only gotten harder with the rise of one-stop cloud vendors that host other people&#x27;s software.<p>But open source has absolutely worked as a business model. This is actually easier to see if you look at companies like IBM. Back around 2000, IBM used to charge $40,000&#x2F;year per CPU for software that was often mediocre. But as one very smart IBM marketing guy told me, the software was basically an excuse to sell IBM Global Services for consulting and customization. At heart, they were making a service play. And IBM of the early 00s loved Linux, for two rather weird reasons:<p>1. It allowed them to freely collaborate with other companies like RedHat based on nothing more than a handshake.<p>2. Even more surprisingly, it allowed collaboration <i>within</i> IBM, between different groups that usually had complex politics.<p>I as understand it, IBM was not, generally speaking, selling Linux. Linux was just one more way to sell Global Services.<p>And of course, RedHat themselves were a service company in those days, at least from what I heard from some of their clients.<p>But service companies are hard, they&#x27;re sales intensive, and they&#x27;re not valued nearly as highly as pure software plays with the same revenue. And if you want to be big, you&#x27;ll eventually need to serve big enterprises. And of course, AWS will happily eat any low-customization revenue you might otherwise be able to snag.<p>So open source + consulting might be a business model, but it relies heavily on running a successful consulting or services business.<p>A much more common way to use open source in business is the &quot;stone soup&quot; model. I&#x27;ve helped my employers open source tons of stuff over the years. It was almost all useful tools, not their main products, so it didn&#x27;t help competitors directly. The upside is that other companies may occasionally contribute something. This is usually pretty modest unless you put in extra effort promoting your software, but it happens. Sometimes, the biggest advantage is that open sourcing a tool is a great way to draw a boundary that says, &quot;This is a generic tool that focuses on one thing. It does not contain business logic.&quot; For certain kinds of tools, this can be a fantastic discipline.<p>But definitely don&#x27;t think that you can release your core product as open source, and then just run a standard product-based business.</div><br/><div id="41501083" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41501083" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragonwriter</span><span>|</span><a href="#41500615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41500936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41503875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41501083">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41501083">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Open source is business model,<p>No, it isn&#x27;t.

All their customers are stuck without any options but to stop using the software.<p>2. They start by making things AGPL.<p>2a. They become established, making decent money; eventually they take the product closed-source, doing one final release.  Their customers continue to be served, but everything is now proprietary.<p>2b. They fail.  The code is already AGPL, so nothing any of their owners or creditors can do to claw it back. 
 Large companies that have come to depend on their software can take their code and continue to use it and develop it on their own if they want.  If there&#x27;s enough of the right kind of people, a community can form around the releases and the project can live on in a pure open-source form.<p>2a is better than 1a, because at least there was a time when things were AGPL; the AGPL code can still be forked off and maintained if there&#x27;s a big enough community.<p>2b is <i>way</i> better than 1b.

We actually spoke before your pivot and we now have a bit overlap on the dashboard builder but our audience is fairly separate.<p>Congrats, you made what I believe is the best move a software company can do in our space.  You will hear a lot of naysayers, and sure the software we build is not as permissive as Apache 2.0 and MIT. Those are all true and valid points. It&#x27;s also true that VCs have perverse incentives and as a naturally skeptic myself, I understand not wanting to touch it.<p>Let me bring a little bit of counter-points to those:<p>- AGPL or Commercial Open-Source Software would probably just not exist at all if there was no path to commercialization at all. So the dichotomy between making it true MIT or AGPL is a false one, it&#x27;s the choice between proprietary&#x2F;no software and AGPL and I think we can all agree the latter is better. Software Engineers need to eat and there is a pool of talented engineers for whom glory is not fully sufficient and also need their work to be a reasonable financial paths. This enables more SWE to compete to build more software and make the software landscape more competitive for the benefit of the end-users.<p>- Taking VC money is not signing a pact with the devil that strips away your entire freedom, especially at @lucasfcosta stage and ours. The real issue is with being fully dependent on that money by having bad financial health and needing to raise in X months. COSS company like ours can stay lean and profitable, taking just the right amount of money from VC to kickstart a long-term journey to become a behemoth of a software company through having advantages over all the proprietary alternatives. Windmill for instance is profitable, and no investors has ever pressured us to go faster or monetize more. 99% of our users are using the free&#x2F;open-source version but the 1% that is not is made of medium and large enterprises that hugely appreciate running their infra on open-source software that they can easily audit and contribute to. It would have been SO MUCH harder to convince them without being open-source given our size. Another fact that helps is pricing but that is also related to our open-source nature. It&#x27;s harder to over-price your large customers because at a certain point they can say screw it, they will just build in-house to go above the proprietary features. All that to say that companies do have incentives but also are made of humans which have their own values and goals, and have some agenda to set their own path, especially early on. It&#x27;s all about balance and I would argue taking a bit of VC money at the seed-stage at a good valuation and then not much more is the optimal path right now.</div><br/><div id="41505004" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41505004" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jay-barronville</span><span>|</span><a href="#41504707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41503918">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41505004">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41505004">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You just can’t win with some folks and I honestly don’t think it’s worth the effort to try.

So nobody&#x27;s going to keep using your product after your company dies just because it&#x27;s open source.<p>With 2), companies almost always end up completely ignoring the &quot;community&quot; and just doing whatever they want. The real &quot;community&quot; is often just people on StackOverflow, Reddit or somewhere else, trying in vain to get someone to help them solve a problem the company won&#x27;t, and usually has nothing to do with code. Even if the product is open source and a user wants to do the hard work of fixing a problem in code and submitting a PR, the company can just balk and reject it (which many companies do). So just because it&#x27;s open source doesn&#x27;t mean there will be support for a real community.<p>With 3), nothing is commoditized, because you&#x27;re open-core. Like with all &quot;open source companies&quot;, the really good features will be locked up behind a paywall. So being open source doesn&#x27;t really give an advantage over competitors either.<p>The only good reasons to go open source are 1) there&#x27;s still people out there who will get excited about the <i>idea</i> of open source, and use the product just for that fact alone, because they haven&#x27;t been burned by an &quot;open source company&quot; yet, and 2) open source is a great way to attract engineering talent.</div><br/><div id="41505552" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41505552" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ezekg</span><span>|</span><a href="#41504282">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41503057">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41505552">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41505552">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Off-topic, but your bio sent me down a fun rabbit hole with ChatGPT.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41503057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41503057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FL410</span><span>|</span><a href="#41504282">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41503522">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41503057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41503057">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This looks like cool software and something I might be interested in, but I hate hate hate locking SSO behind the &quot;enterprise&quot; tier.

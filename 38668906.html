Overall I can say, the quality of WotC material has never been particularly good, but in recent years has fallen even below its old mediocrity, especially compared to their much smaller competition (not that it matters for the market share). Sure, 5e is pretty much late-stage dnd and splatbooks have always been rather questionable at the end of an edition. But the quasi monopoly of dnd and its success is also its greatest problem. They remember the reactions of the community towards 4th edition, as well as the ogl disaster earlier this year and they probably know that they cannot simply push &quot;new product&quot; to replace the current material people have purchased. They can only extend it or make slight improvements that don&#x27;t disturb the average player who already spend money on something they like and plays &quot;fine&quot; (i.e. an inoffensive, acceptable and conventional fantasy experience). &quot;one d&amp;d&quot; playtest material, anyone? d&amp;d players are a rather conservative bunch of weirdos, why else would they cling to such a dusty system? So, what&#x27;s there to promise the shareholders? A successful new edition? Unlikely. Maybe digital products? But you hardly need the old staff for that. We&#x27;ll see, I guess.
On a personal note, I&#x27;ve all the dnd I ever need and I&#x27;ve been rather bored with it. For my ttrpg future it&#x27;s currently at the bottom of my list of things I want to play. The market of ttrpgs is generally pretty over-saturated and while the last years have been great as far as products by small publishers go, there&#x27;s been less and less interesting material, e.g. even reputable publishers are desperately picking up tv and movie franchises to turn into rpg books. The hobby has had ups and downs, the early 80s, the late 90s, and the last few years were high points, now expect a downturn. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it will remain popular, but there will be less money in it for conventional material. And I guess WotC knows it, too.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38673746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38673746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solardev</span><span>|</span><a href="#38680467">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38673746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38673746">[57 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the same Hasbro that tried to retroactively close off the D&amp;D Open Game License (and thus the third party ecosystem).

And rather than focusing on the tactical turn based combat of the 4e (which was often kind a drag to execute without digital DM aids and digital tabletops), they shifted the focus more to storytelling and player involvement. It was the right move, IMO, for a tabletop role playing game.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think the 5e rules translate as well to computer RPGs.

They chased me out onto a small patio, where I set up a perfect ambush: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.cleanshot.com&#x2F;tPHhWk6p" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;share.cleanshot.com&#x2F;tPHhWk6p</a><p>A cloud of darkness blocked vision out of the only exit, with only my fighter visible at the end of the ledge. Each enemy would come stumbling out of the darkness, only to be ambushed by arrows fired from a dust cloud. Enraged, they&#x27;d run towards the ledge, engage my fighter, only to be blown into the chasm below by my warlock hiding on a tower above. Over the next couple hours, I ended up killing like 40-60 of these huge guards, a pile of bodies at the river bottom. (Apparently this was some sort of boss fight, which I had no idea lol). It was just such a perfect tactical setup to blow them off the ledge, one by one, unaware and so angry :D<p>One of the best moments I ever had in any video game.<p>My full review, with more silliness: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;76561199138390397&#x2F;recommended&#x2F;1086940" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcommunity.com&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;76561199138390397&#x2F;recomm...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38677465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38677465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jghn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38673746">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673834">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677813">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38674489">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38677465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38677465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We just need to move on from DnD to other IPs at this point<p>Or go back to AD&amp;D 1e like the good lord ... err gygax intended :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38674489" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38674489" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bugglebeetle</span><span>|</span><a href="#38673746">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673834">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677465">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38670213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38674489">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38674489">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Divinity Original Sin 2 has better combat mechanics<p>While I think the combat in 5E combat in BG3 is fairly simple by comparison, DOS2 combat was definitely not better.

I remember when full art lands and full art promos were RARE and with money for no reason other than their collectability. I really liked when cards were rare because of the fact that they were good and uncommon and maybe because they were the same as the regular card but foil, not because they were arbitrarily a different type of shiny, or like when that one card from Kamigawa had a different color neon border that made it spike to 3k for a while, let alone the new serialized cards.<p>I wish we could go back to that, because I was so excited about collecting cards back then. Nowadays I feel like unless I open a pack with a crazy reprint or a REALLY lucky list card, there are essentially no cards worth anything. I remember pulling some shock lands and even when they were only 8 bucks it felt really great, like it was gambling. Now, I only ever get packs of remastered sets, and standard sets are wholly uninteresting. I do a $40 draft and get $3 worth of cards, and it is to be seen if these EVER go up in value.<p>I still love the game, and I play it more than ever. But there are three groups of people: investors, people that realize it is a TCG, and people that think all cards should be worthless. The first is greedy, the middle is realistic, and the latter is idealistic.

In drafts, much of the actual gameplay IS the drafting and gambling. The actual decks that get built are usually uninteresting, just fast aggressive combos that play like starter decks.<p>Thankfully I discovered Commander pre-cons, easily upgraded with some cheap singles, and have a lot of fun with that.

Of course, 1st deck &#x2F; 1st pick bombs are always taken and are fully secret, but 3rd round, its unlikely that the rare is going to be in the colors of your left-side opponent. So there&#x27;s a good chance that the rare-to-your-left is passed to you, giving you information on what that opponent has drafted (whether that card matched their deck or not).<p>There are also incredibly powerful commons (ex: Lightning Bolt a few years ago...) that would be 1st-draft 1st-pick and better than the rare. So if you&#x27;re 2nd pick and there&#x27;s a good rare on the passed deck, it means the person to your left is likely going red&#x2F;lightning bolt 1st pick.<p>Or in another set, when Doom Blade was in format, that&#x27;d be the 1st-pick &#x2F; 1st draft card as a very powerful removal spell despite being a common.<p>&gt; that almost never give me a useful deck in the end.<p>But everyone has the same condition in a draft.

Obviously if your 1st pack &#x2F; 1st pick was much better than everyone else&#x27;s, that&#x27;s a bit of the luck to the draft.<p>The &quot;goal&quot; of Draft is to pick the color that &quot;the table has ignored&quot;. If your 7 other opponents are white, red, blue, green, red, green, and white... then you can pickup all the powerful black-cards. The &quot;winner&quot; of the draft will likely be fought between blue vs black (the only two &quot;uninterrupted drafters&quot;) in the table that set.<p>There&#x27;s only so many good cards for any given strategy. If *EVERYONE* goes early-aggro &#x2F; rushdown (IE: White&#x2F;Red&#x2F;Green), then the one guy who drafted all the control cards (Blue&#x2F;Black) probably just beats everyone at the table.<p>-----------<p>I&#x27;d say the main problem with Draft is the unbalanced nature of it all. If you&#x27;re sitting to the right of a newbie who passes you good cards (or is otherwise ignorant of the Drafting format), you end up building a deck far more powerful than everyone else.<p>IE: The biggest advantage you can get in a Draft is sitting to the right of a newbie (2x rounds where you pass to the right). The 2nd biggest advantage is sitting to the left of a newbie (1x round where you pass to the left).<p>But if everyone at the table is of roughly the same skill level, its a great format. The drafting phase innately self-balances, as everyone is picking (and changing their picks) in relation to what they&#x27;ve been passed.<p>---------<p>&gt; I&#x27;d much rather spend $50 on a precon and another $20 or so on singles,<p>Competitive decks &quot;in the meta&quot; are closer to $200 to $500 in my experience. 60x cards, and a chunk of them cost $20 to $80.<p>Preparation and Money ruins the game since you&#x27;re just buying up known combos and 4x of the best $50 cards that on the last tournament...</div><br/><div id="38674494" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38674494" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solardev</span><span>|</span><a href="#38670213">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38674359">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38679905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38674494">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38674494">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It sounds like you don&#x27;t know what to look for in Drafts.<p>[snip]<p>Yeah, exactly.

A campaign setting (96 pages).<p>2. A prefab adventure for levels 3-10.<p>3.

If some people have more willingness to pay, you charge them more, and you get more money! Instead of having some consumer surplus and some producer surplus, you have lots of producer surplus and almost zero consumer surplus.<p>The problem I see with attempting to drive consumer surplus to zero is that -- staying entirely within the realm of theory -- you end up with a customer base consisting mostly of people who are <i>almost completely indifferent</i> as to whether they buy your product or not.<p>This is not a good way to build goodwill. And, if you ever even slightly misjudge the value of your own product, suddenly you see people abandoning it in droves, because the barely-noticeable dip in value was still larger than the gap between how much everyone liked your stuff vs how much they liked the money it was costing them.<p>Brandon Sanderson has started writing about how much he likes WotC&#x27;s model of selling the cards at every conceivable price point, and how it&#x27;s inspired him to try to sell his books the same way.<p>But I think he&#x27;s overlooking the fact that, as a millionaire many times over, WotC&#x27;s highest offered price point is still insignificant to him.

But that drop rate doesn&#x27;t always evaluate to higher value. It correlates and they try to make if so, but that&#x27;s ultimately a different marketplace who externally decides what has value.<p>Video games don&#x27;t have such safeguards. It&#x27;s all on the studios servers and they can adjust value on the fly. Unless lootboxes are all cosmetics there&#x27;s a more direct hand in the market that can influence value and worth. And it all comes crashing down the moment the studios decides to shut down the servers. I feel that&#x27;s an intrinsic difference that places a video game closer to a casino (&quot;the house always wins&quot;) than a TCG (throw out what you think is worth and let the community sort it out).</div><br/></div></div><div id="38674279" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38674279" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AndrewKemendo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38673188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673502">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38677735">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38674279">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38674279">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They did one round, but I think it takes 3 rounds of pump and dump before it really dies</div><br/></div></div><div id="38673762" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38673762" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dontlaugh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38673188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38673502">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38674279">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38675519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38673762">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38673762">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly.

They should be a last resort, not a well-worn tool.<p>Be careful, such legislation might reduce layoffs, but might make other aspects of the labor market worse. For instance, in some European countries where layoffs are hard to pull off, companies are very adverse to hiring anyone, lest they hire a dud that they have to keep on payroll forever. Or they only hire them for fixed term contracts, so that if the economic winds change they&#x27;re not stuck with a long term liability. It&#x27;s the opposite in freerer labor markets like in the US. Companies are more willing to hire unproven&#x2F;unconventional candidates because they know they can be easily fired if things don&#x27;t work out, and they react faster to demand shocks because each hire isn&#x27;t a long term liability. That&#x27;s not to say we should accept people committing suicide after layoffs as a trade-off for a more dynamic labor market. A robust unemployment system and&#x2F;or social safety net mitigates the negative effects of layoffs without the affecting dynamism of the labor market, and should be the solution rather than making workers harder to fire.</div><br/><div id="38677995" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38677995" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johnnyanmac</span><span>|</span><a href="#38673905">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38675027">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38674227">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38677995">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38677995">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s easy to get a decently paying job to begin with in the States.

That&#x27;s just another weakness in that companies will try so hard to not convert someone to FTE even if they at some point are more productive than most of their staff. That can also be regulated. X months&#x2F;years of work and you convert or walk. Worst case the employee gets a few good years of experience, of which should be more than enough experience to make the next step much easier than the first.<p>----<p>I feel like the best balance of this would be<p>- FTE gets a 3-6 month trial period (similar to an internship). This period can be treated as &quot;at will&quot; and can be let go if stipulations show they can&#x27;t perform to the role. After that, you got an employee and that employee is protected in someone way.<p>- You need to layoff, fine. 6 month severance minimum. Otherwise the employee is either breaking the law or borderline breaking the law (e.g. sexual harassment, coercion, etc), has a significant breach of contract (breaking NDA that isn&#x27;t whistle blowing, consistently is not available at agreed upon hours), or has multiple months of severe lack of productivity to give them the boot.<p>- contract work has stipulations as above. Enforce a decent minimum contract length, only allow renewals for some given period of time by the same company (my gut says 2-3 years of work at the company, but the exact number isn&#x27;t important) before either breaking the contact or hiring full time. Contracting houses also cannot keep an employee for more than 2 of these contract lengths<i>; we shouldn&#x27;t encourage places to keep employees long long term as some mandated middleman<p>- in general, encourage more apprenticeships if you want to train unproven talent (and not leave it to a contractor).

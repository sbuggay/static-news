Garage is painless to set up and, unlike Minio, is designed for &quot;small scale&quot;, self-hosted use cases where your nodes may not have identical storage and compute. One current caveat of Garage, compared to Minio, is that anonymous access is not supported. (Patches welcome!) This means you can&#x27;t easily generate or share links to files in a bucket.<p>I personally use Garage for locally testing things that run against the S3 API. It&#x27;s very easy to run the single binary directly. No need for containers, but of course that is also an option, and it&#x27;s very easy to containerize since you realistically only need to run a statically linked binary and mount a TOML file somewhere.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38514526" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38514526" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RajT88</span><span>|</span><a href="#38514565">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38514951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38514526">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38514526">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My local setup - please critique as you like.<p>For NAS, I am running Windows Server 2022 (I have a rational reason for this).

Current energy consumption is about 250 Watt - but I also have an old Xeon from 2013.<p>The main cost (after initial investment) is harddrives and (of course) learning time. It pays off in other areas, too. I just got a job that I think I only got because of my report of self-hosting.<p>The biggest convenience is that I can sync all devices and all data (e.g. Nextcloud auto-upload from phones, DAVx5 for calendar&#x2F;contacts) to a single, secure and private place that is then automatically backed up. I don&#x27;t know the correct word, but maybe &quot;liberating&quot; describes the feeling best.<p>All of this does not require super-secret knowledge, just some motivation (and you should not be completely broke).

I had drawn up designs for my house, solar installation and half a rack of kit. This was to run a domain for my immediate family and all services including media storage and streaming. Solar was going to be 100% grid independent i.e. not some crappy provider based install. The infra was all targeted at Debian.<p>Then I got two sick parents and a divorce on my hands.<p>Then I realised exactly how much time, energy, money and headspace managing all this crap really took out of my life because I had to spend it on other stuff instead not out of choice but necessity. One of the absolute killers for all of this wasn&#x27;t really the cost and complexity but the time to curate my data and deal with it is incredibly high if you have a lot of it. One of the worst sub-parts was the question from the kids: I want this music and then going to get it and deal with it and then distribute it to everyone. This would take <i>hours</i> a month to manage.<p>I came out of the other side of this somewhat unscathed thankfully and with a much larger pile of cash than I thought I was going to.<p>So a year long project took place. I combed through several TB of data, from myself and my parents and did a huge minimisation effort. I deleted all the fuzzy ass photos, pictures of stuff no one cared about, all the films I&#x27;d already watched, deleted all the crap music, deleted scanned paperwork dating back to 1989 I&#x27;d never need, everything. I also did a physical clean out at that point. Then I scanned all the family photos as a backup.<p>End game was everything everyone in my family ever did, or found value in, could be crammed in 200Gb of iCloud with 40Gb left over. Apple got to handle the music too. So that&#x27;s how it rolls.  I have no infrastructure other than a laptop, router and offline backup drive now, no huge energy dependency (my energy usage is stupid low) and my domain sits on AWS&#x2F;CloudFront and Apple iCloud+.<p>There&#x27;s a dependency in one form or another so I&#x27;ll pick the one that makes my life easier. Feeling liberated for me is not having the weight of this on <i>my</i> shoulders personally and not leaving that weight on my kids shoulders one day to pick through and deal with. I&#x27;ve been through too many dead people&#x27;s stuff to want to do that to someone else now.<p>If I want to learn something, I&#x27;ll do a formal higher education thing, because I have the time to do it now!<p>Edit: notably there was an advantage here at two points. Firstly my internet connection was down for 2 days when someone cut the cable. I did not lose any services because I could 4G tether. And secondly I moved house and had several months of hell trying to get an internet connection sorted out. Again, 4G was fine. I was pulling 100 gig a month over that 4G working from home and there was no noticeable material difference for me.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38513993" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38513993" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">below43</span><span>|</span><a href="#38514873">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38514219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38513993">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38513993">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s definitely worth people considering getting local storage.

The model was developed by (i) assigning explanatory variables to brine samples collected at wells, (ii) tuning the RF model to make predictions at wells and assess model performance, (iii) mapping spatially continuous predictions of lithium concentrations across the Reynolds oolite unit of the Smackover Formation in southern Arkansas, and (iv) inspecting the model for explanatory variable importance and influence. Initial model tuning used the tidymodels framework (52) in R (53) to test XGBoost, K-nearest neighbors, and RF algorithms; RF models consistently had higher accuracy and lower bias, so they were used to train the final model and predict lithium.<p>Explanatory variables used to tune the RF model included geologic, geochemical, and temperature information for Jurassic and Cretaceous units. The geologic framework of the model domain is expected to influence brine chemistry both spatially and with depth. Explanatory variables used to train the RF model must be mapped across the model domain to create spatially continuous predictions of lithium. Thus, spatially continuous subsurface geologic information is key, although these digital resources are often difficult to acquire.<p>Interesting to me that RF performed better the XGBoost, would have expected at least a similar outcome if tuned correctly.</div><br/><div id="41919565" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41919565" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jofer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41917385">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41918858">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41919565">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41919565">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Put another way, this is pretty similar to the interpolation approaches that would normally be used for datasets like this in the world of mineral exploration. Kriging&#x2F;co-kriging (i.e. gaussian processes) is the more commonly used approach in this particular field due to both the long history and the available hyperparameters for things like spatial aniostropy.<p>However, kriging is really quite difficult to use with non-continuous inputs. RF is a lot more forgiving there. You don&#x27;t need to develop a covariance model for discrete values (or a covariance model for how the different inputs relate, either).</div><br/></div></div><div id="41918858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41918858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lordgrenville</span><span>|</span><a href="#41917385">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41919565">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41918303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41918858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41918858">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So it turns out that there&#x27;s no theoretical reason that gradient boosting will always outperform RF (which would violate the &quot;no free lunch&quot; theorem).

RF tends to do quite well out of the box, and is very fast to fit. It&#x27;s less of a pain to cross-validate too, with fewer tuning parameters. XGBoost has a huge number of knobs to tune, and its performance varies from god-awful with bad hyperparameters to somewhat better than RF with good ones. Giant PITA with nested cross-validation, etc. though.<p>I haven&#x27;t read in detail what their validation strategy is but this seems like the kind of problem where it&#x27;s not so easy as you&#x27;d think -- you need to be very careful about how you stratify your train, dev, and test sets. A random 80&#x2F;10&#x2F;10 split would be way too optimistic: your model would just learn to interpolate between geographically proximate locations. You&#x27;d probably need to cross-validate across different geographic areas.<p>This also seems like an application that would benefit from &quot;active learning&quot;. given that drilling and testing is expensive, you&#x27;d want to choose where to collect new data based on where it would best update your model&#x27;s accuracty.

Oil, coal, gas, etc. mining is huge and lithium batteries plus renewables are already reducing the need for those. So, the transition to renewables and batteries might actually result in a net reduction of mining.<p>Of course doing lithium mining cleanly and responsibly is an important topic. Especially in places close to where people live. But considering the vast amounts of other stuff we mine already at a much larger scale than we&#x27;ll ever need to mine lithium, this is a drop in the ocean.<p>And of course the lithium that is mined can be used and recycled over and over again. Once it is in circulation, we&#x27;ll be re-using it forever. And given the improvements in battery tech, production processes, etc. the amount currently in circulation is likely to power a larger amount of battery capacity when we do recycle it eventually. Even when considering inevitable losses during recycling.<p>Lithium recycling processes are working fine already of course but there&#x27;s very little recycling being done at scale for the simple reason that most lithium batteries in use are still very young and quite far away from needing any recycling. If anything, the improved life times of batteries is pushing the date that we need to be recycling at scale further and further away.<p>Extraction methods very much depend on composition of the deposits and whether they are in brine or other form and what other materials are present.

See Orozco v Casimiro<p>2. Ill-advised farmers up north are consuming tons of water on crops that make zero sense, and in many cases are growing crops that are basically exporting our scarce water overseas. Then they want to complain about a &#x27;government-created dust bowl&#x27; when it&#x27;s their own out of control water usage basically creating and exacerbating the situation. Oh and the desire to live in a floodplain, thus draining the largest lake in the state (if not landlocked lake in the country) and worsening drought conditions for the area for the past near-century.<p>3. OTHER STATES keep shipping their homeless here, thus drastically increasing our poverty numbers, artificially, and straining resources we don&#x27;t really have thanks to ill-advised programs that do nothing to actually address anything.<p>4. Thanks to climate change, it&#x27;s getting fucking HOT. Like, the heat you would normally only experience in the desert, is now a regular occurrence here in the valleys of SoCal. The deserts are actually cooler on occasion.<p>5. People can&#x27;t drive and the cops do nothing even when it happens right in front of them. Oh, speaking of police, did you know many of them are in inter-department gangs? Yea, we just had to outlaw that.<p>6. Nobody&#x27;s fixing the infrastructure. Sure new stuff is being built but that is supposed to be ON TOP of what we already have - and we&#x27;re just letting what we already have crumble away. Yea internet and some power is going down but that&#x27;s about it. Roadways, bridges, oh no. Route 66? It&#x27;s screwed right now. Recent issues we had on the 40 forced a traffic reroute and the weight limit on those little bridges is 3 tons - guess what went over those bridges? Semi trucks with 10 or more tons of freight. You bet those bridges got wrecked, and nobody&#x27;s fixing them. Ludlow to Cadiz is absolutely wrecked. Thankfully, I have an offroad vehicle and powerline roads exist, so I&#x27;m able to still get to digging areas or visit Dish Hill Volcano.<p>7. Thanks to new law, fast food workers have a minimum wage over the state minimum wage.  So many jobs which require high skill, like what I do in LASERs and LED lighting, get paid less than them (I&#x27;m lucky, where I work knows my worth) and it ends up being demoralizing. I&#x27;m betting it caused a small hit across a few sectors as people said &quot;I&#x27;ll pay the $30 to get a license that lets me make $20 an hour&quot; meanwhile starting techs in my sector get $16, or $17 on a night shift differential.<p>Happy yet?

Owners are sometimes surprised to find out someone else owns the rights to the minerals under their land<p>&gt; U.S. laws regulating mining and mineral rights typically prohibit mineral owners from damaging or interfering with the use of any homes or other improvements on the land when extracting minerals. As a result, mineral owners do not typically attempt mineral extraction in highly populated areas.

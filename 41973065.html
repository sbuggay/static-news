Very much like this picture: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com&#x2F;bphoto&#x2F;NudVpPKiq1AsWL1CSAa_-A&#x2F;o.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com&#x2F;bphoto&#x2F;NudVpPKiq1AsWL1CSAa_...</a> So I agree crime and theft is a big factor. But it&#x27;s not enough of an explanation, as other high-trust societies (and even more parts of the US not that long ago) don&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t emulate various Japanese aspects, and even in Japan there are various &quot;why do they do things this way&quot; aspects that would make most sense in a low-trust or corrupt society. Some of them can be traced to being an over-reaction, like the lack of public trash cans in Tokyo. Increasingly I think the real answer to these &quot;why can&#x27;t place x have this unique thing Japan has?&quot; sorts of questions is &quot;because it&#x27;s not Japan&quot; -- you need the whole collection of aspects that only came about via Japan&#x27;s unique history, you can&#x27;t do it by just capturing a few aspects like their low crime state. It&#x27;s an unhelpful answer, but at the same time suggests maybe people should look for ways to do something better, not emulative.

I need to know the market, the laws and regulations, and some other stuffs, most of which are extremely boring and not really &quot;hackable&quot; (as for hackers) because accountants and governments already sorted everything up to make sure it&#x27;s hard for small businesses to evade tax -- You can learn which parts are expenses in an afternoon, and then you have to deal with a lot of headaches.<p>I know some people who own gas stations and large depanneurs (in QC they are independent convenient shops), which are luxurious on face, but they either have to pick a remote one (away from competition from supermarkets) or&#x2F;and work 7 days without hiring an extra hand.

They of course get an even better return during the sale, but I am happy with what I get for doing nothing.<p>My rental properties are paying me a decent passive income of about 6%, and additionally the total investment about doubles in roughly 5 years.  Also the tax advantages are pretty huge with the depreciation and the ability to take the money from a sale and put it into a new property with no tax.<p>So say you start with an initial $100K investment.  That pays back about 6K a year for 5 years and then turns into about 200K after 5 years which you then put into a new property and make 12K a year, and so on and so on.<p>So if you start with 100K when you are say 25, then when you are 50, you will have around 1.6M in property assets making you about 96K a year in passive income, where the depreciation on the property value and the assets in the property outweigh the tax on the income, so that income is all tax free.  And that calculation is assuming you don&#x27;t put even more capital in from some other source.  Of course it&#x27;s a roughly average return assumption.  Some properties will do better and others will do worse, but it&#x27;s been my experience that it&#x27;s about right.<p>Of course this is only one of my investment baskets.

It itself was a set of interconnecting passive income schemes[0], ultimately derived from your ability to own the most economically valuable land. This scheme hinges upon your ability to enclose and exclude access to that land by force - <i>not</i> prior labor paying off over time.<p>Of course, the only passive income schemes that work today are the &quot;prior labor&quot; type. But that&#x27;s because of copyright and patent law, which exist specifically with the idea that you can make something valuable now and charge the public for it later. A creative work or an invention is itself land being excluded by force, but this is a magical abstract land of nearly infinite size[1]. It&#x27;s enclosers are empowered not through direct force, but through the blessing of a legal priesthood.<p>Ok, I suppose if we&#x27;re including force and feudalism, we probably should also include, say, organized crime. But in that case the labor isn&#x27;t stored, it&#x27;s slaved: you find suckers and scam them into doing crimes to your benefit, then get them to continue working for you, because if they ever leave you can just kill them, or sick the Feds on them.<p>Y&#x27;know, I&#x27;m starting to think passive income is actually just a funny way to say theft...<p>[0] The two schemes I&#x27;m thinking of are manorialism, and something akin to modern rent extraction or &quot;chokepoint capitalism&quot; in which you own a road or river and can charge money to people passing through your land. I forget the name of the latter, and there&#x27;s probably additional relationships I&#x27;m not counting. I know the Holy Roman Empire was lousy with the latter kind.<p>[1] Since there&#x27;s far more of this creativity land than there is land on Earth, it&#x27;s far harder to find land that people want or have to pay for.

Failed miserably. Funny how brain works, I knew in 3 months that this is not honest, it feels spammy but then orders were coming in so I convinced myself that half the amazon products are doing the same thing. There is market for it then why should I not do this. This nagging voice in my head never went away and I paid for this later on. This matters when you have to work through night to get the marketing campaign out or you have double down the investment for certain product during holiday sale. Dealing with daily email of customers or tracking lost orders. I eventually lost energy and any sort of desire to grow my business. I was not making the kind of money I was promised by the field of dropshipping without adding way more money in spamy marketing and I had not passion to sell the product I Was selling. Certain folks who seems to be making 1m rev per year are also pivoting through spammy products every month and just dumping 100s and 1000s of dollars in facebook ads. It is more of a spammy marketing game then implementing any sort of creative or intellectual skillset. If anyone is thinking of doing this then I would encourage or first figure out how attached you are to money and the work you are doing. I was pulled into this because I thought I am smarter than rest and I can crack this because of my skills in technology and design so I dont to pay anyone to setup website, taxes, marketing etc however I missed out on how much soulless you have to be to run such a business. I dont mean soulless as a bad thing here, if you are robot or a you can setup a bot to do this then by all means try it but I just could not. This had a double impact on my life. Not only I failed to make money, wasted time but I also hate myself of even getting stuck into this. Lost my confidence and self respect which probably was unfounded anyway. Only thing I can tell myself is that hopefully this lifted some sort of delusion I had about myself and I learn and become better at life through this.</div><br/><div id="41974657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41974657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SoftTalker</span><span>|</span><a href="#41974498">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41974624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41974657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41974657">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The lesson here is that there really is no free lunch.

I’ve witnessed many people on the same market as I was, trying to find something to sell, and failing at it.

It’s that you didn’t have a good edge at start, maybe your only flaw is not judging against your initial idea, early enough, and waiting for the next opportunity in your professional life.

There is a lot of capital out there in the world looking for a return. If the returns really were so attractive on a risk-adjusted basis, and you could deploy a fair amount of capital without building a large organization and incurring a bunch of fixed operating expenses, why wouldn&#x27;t someone who is a proven successful operator in that field just raise more capital themselves and keep more of the profits?<p>Even when the propositions look plausible on the surface, there is usually some hidden gotcha that prevents it from being scalable. For example, the economics only work if you can find a really good location that meets a bunch of requirements, and there simply aren&#x27;t that many of those &quot;good&quot; locations left.

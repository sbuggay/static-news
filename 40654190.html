Are you sure such a right is typically granted? I mean even the gap between 409A valuations and preferred valuations, as well as a huge amount of precedent, give a different material value to preferred and common stock. Giving that right out of thin air in a sale by an insider is effectively theft from common holders and I have trouble believing what you’re saying as I’m not sure how that could be kosher, if perhaps infrequently litigated.

Worse, the stats aren&#x27;t great for a chance on return. Your lotto ticket gets expensive and risky as soon as you decide to leave.<p>Articles like this one hammer home more and more to me how little VCs actually value early employees. Paying out founders to stay is a strategic move. Keeping them is worth it because they are the face of the company and turmoil at that level hurts their payout. Burning out early employees is not a concern because you can just swap them without drama. In fact, with the way options are structured and the &#x27;industry wisdom&#x27; to hold off purchasing, it feels like a strategic move to burn out early employees since many employees that are forced out often can&#x27;t even buy their options. They are left with nothing after all that work and risk. From a purely cynical view this is a great thing for VCs since now the company got all the benefit of an early employee and just lost all the costs.<p>I don&#x27;t know about the other three points, but I can guarantee you point 1 of &#x27;right sizing perceptions&#x27; is wrong.</div><br/><div id="40654885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40654885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lumost</span><span>|</span><a href="#40654725">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40654969">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40654885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40654885">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the model, you can see a lot of early stage founders looking for a &quot;founding engineer&quot; which is really just an excuse to pay founder salaries for 1% of the company rather than 50%.

If we&#x27;re out here both making chairs and when we sell a chair for $100, you get $85 (assuming someone took one of the standard-ish seed rounds that are usually 10-20%?) and I get $1? No thanks.<p>The other sense is aware that the founder is taking various risks and blah blah blah. Ok whatever. Let&#x27;s pretend somehow 1% is a fair number and just look at it from a payoff perspective. 1% of stripe? Yeah I&#x27;ll take that. 1% of the other 1000 startups who had mediocre exits or just muddle along to finally do some kind of tender? I&#x27;m barely breaking even. 1% of the other 10000 startups that just folded?

Start it. There&#x27;s no cabal preventing you from doing that. Have better options than 1% of a likely-dead startup, that pay more and have better WLB? Take them.<p>After all, few industries give <i>any</i> employees equity. First employee at an ice cream parlor? 0%. First employee of a hedge fund? 0%. First employee of a medical practice? 0%.<p>Equity grants can be motivating and aligning, and frankly more industries should probably consider them. But not that many people are in a position to found a startup that can raise money (larger equity grants are much more common for pre-external-funding employees) and this differential reflects that.<p>Btw, &quot;1% of the other 10000 startups that folded&quot; is worth about the same as a founder&#x27;s 40%: $0. The issue is the middle ground, but there the equity grant is often not worth the paper it&#x27;s written on: typically the acquirers dictate who gets the money. 1% or 5%, unless the acquirer is trying to retain you, chances are you&#x27;ll see nothing even if the nominal payout is large.<p>Anyway, the upshot is what people have been saying for decades: don&#x27;t do a startup for the money.

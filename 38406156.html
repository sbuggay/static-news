Might be difficult for elderly) - Apple video on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qDm7GiKra28" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qDm7GiKra28</a><p>- Having a learning partner really helps the blind person. Try to learn to use a phone blind with him, it will allow you to help debug his (most definitely occuring) issues<p>- Watch some videos on how blind people use the iPhone, lots of tips there. For example Molly Burke, or even simple ones like this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3FVjLXIaBC4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3FVjLXIaBC4</a><p>- For elderly, an iPad is really nice. Especially as dexterity gets worse it&#x27;s easier to use blindly. Also usability between iPhone and iPad is almost the same, so easy transition between both (i.e. on the go)<p>- For movies, check out Greta.

He can also ask for more info etc. And if that doesn&#x27;t work out, he can call a volunteer for free, 24-7.<p>Another good one is Seeing AI. This one is from Microsoft, and it has all sorts of useful utilities inside it, including a way to tell how bright a room is (helps to know if you left lights on or not), a barcode scanner that gives you product info (it beeps at you faster or slower to let you know you&#x27;re getting warmer), a color analyzer that kinda&#x27; works sometimes, a document reader with voice guidance to help you get the camera lined up, a currency reader, and I think a few more goodies.<p>Many countries also have a library service for the blind.

She is pretty intelligent and wanted to learn new things so I thought I&#x27;d try to set up VoiceOver and similar things mentioned in this thread - various assisted screen technologies. Unfortunately it was a complete failure. I think that for whatever reason, in general trying to teach new things to an elderly person who&#x27;s newly blind is an uphill battle. If you don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll be able to hack it I wouldn&#x27;t try, it&#x27;s somewhat demoralizing to fail at something at any age. My grandmother dealt well with it but it was clearly somewhat upsetting to fail to learn something, especially as she was proud of learning other things quickly throughout her life (for example learning to drive, where she passed her test the first try with minimal prior instruction.) If you do think he has a decent chance at learning it I would start slow and build your way up.<p>What <i>did</i> work was Siri, an audiobook player, and a Google Home connected to speakers. The one she uses most of the time is the audiobook player, it&#x27;s a large chunky machine that takes CDs that she gets in the mail. Every so often she gets a menu of new available audiobooks and someone sits down with her to pick out which she&#x27;d like. The next most used is Siri on her iPhone. I set up her contacts with various easy-to-say names and now she can call whoever she needs whenever. She uses Siri 95% just to call people, the other 5% she occasionally does look something up or ask the weather but it&#x27;s mostly just calls. The least used is the Google Home, which she uses to play classical music through the speakers.<p>One thing that&#x27;s not technology related is that being blind is lonely. The biggest thing that helps with this is regular small interactions. Any way you can facilitate more short visits is good, for example with the mailman, neighbors stopping by, family, et cetera. Even short phone calls help. The best are the visits that happen &quot;automatically&quot; so they don&#x27;t slow over time. For example if you plan a phone call once a week to pick out some new audiobooks or podcasts to put on his device of choice.<p>Good luck!</div><br/><div id="38410910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38410910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rramadass</span><span>|</span><a href="#38407993">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38406540">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38410910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38410910">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the most simple, straight-forward and workable solution.<p>Trying to teach elderly people involved usage of technology will be frustrating to them and everybody else.

Additionally they can assist with a broader range of tasks like caning, adaptive equipment for meal prep, braille instruction, etc.</div><br/><div id="38410727" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38410727" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bfcpllc</span><span>|</span><a href="#38408485">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38411515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38410727">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38410727">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m a commercial building systems engineering consultant and business owner, and have been visually impaired for &gt;30 years (juvenile type of macular degeneration onset as an early teen).

My state’s division for the Blind and Visually Impaired (DBVI) resources have been very helpful over the years. They provide adaptive tech kit for free (e.g., iPads, PCs, large screens) and software&#x2F;instruction for those who need it).<p>The OP didn’t indicate whether their grandparent is retired (suspecting so?) but in that case, sometimes the State’s path is a little different—they put a huge effort into workforce development, and sometimes different efforts into adaptive tech &amp; services for folks not intending to return to the workforce. In our state, there is an association for the blind that I believes handles more of those cases (but I don’t know for sure).<p>I’ll also give a +1 for everyone I know who is blind and visually impaired having an iPhone.

I think it was a daily program.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still on in Houston, but if it was a national program, you might be able to find it online somewhere.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38406468" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38406468" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kldavis4</span><span>|</span><a href="#38407518">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38409432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38406468">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38406468">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Supersense (ios&#x2F;android) is the app that was recommended for my grandmother and can be used for reading mail, etc. I honestly found it to be buggy and hard for her to use.

Smooth flat glass without tactile feedback, advertising-focused producer intent, and frequently-changing UI&#x2F;UX are all the antithesis of high usability for the visually-disabled and elderly.<p>Android is <i>not</i> particularly good for the visually or otherwise disabled, in part because there&#x27;s simply so much variance amongst devices and vendors.  I&#x27;m not sure that iOS is particularly <i>better</i> but it is at least <i>far  more consistent</i>.<p>I&#x27;d strongly suggest looking into <i>physical</i> players.  One of the best in the US (presuming from your &quot;in town for the holidays&quot; remark) is the US Library of Congress National Library Service for the Blind and Print-Disabled:<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;</a>&gt;<p>In particular this piece of shinay kit:<p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;services-and-resources&#x2F;equipment-for-nls-materials&#x2F;#nls-digital-talking-book-players-free" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;services-and-resources&#x2F;equipment-for...</a>&gt;<p>That&#x27;s the NLS Talking Book Player.  What you&#x27;ll note is that it has large, physically-differentiated, Braille-labeled buttons.  Less obvious are other features:<p>- Physical headphone jack.<p>- Cartridge and USB slots.  The player will support up to ~16 GB USB sticks, which can hold well over 100 books at a time.<p>- An integrated, audio, information and help guide which will walk the user through all the features and functions, as well as give current player information (book position, book title, elapsed, remaining, total time, power&#x2F;battery status).<p>- &quot;Bookshelf mode&quot; permitting navigation through multi-book cartridges and USB sticks.<p>- Excellent and detailed printed documentation including a user manual (&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;Digital-Talking-Book-Library-Manual-1.00-28.Feb_.10.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;Digital-T...</a>&gt;) and service manual (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;Digital-Talking-Book-Service-Manual-1.0-Technician.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;Digital-T...</a>).<p>What that will play are the 300,000+ items in the National Library Service&#x27;s BARD (Braille and Audio Reading Download) collection:  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;services-and-resources&#x2F;catalog-and-bard&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;nls&#x2F;services-and-resources&#x2F;catalog-and-b...</a>&gt;.

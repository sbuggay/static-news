A healthy, vibrant startup draws more investors during fundraising. The competition gives founders the leverage to negotiate for more founder-friendly terms. Healthy startups get better valuations, better terms, and raise funds with much less effort.<p>Hmm. The lesson I learn from that is to bootstrap&#x2F;self-fund, rather than get investment in the first place.</div><br/><div id="39600020" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39600020" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aetherspawn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39599992">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39600020">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39600020">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah I have a small business and I sway strongly towards being contempt with letting the business grow at its own rate.<p>No, it won’t have a 1 bil payout, but you make your own rules and you’ll get a healthy cash out from the dividends after only 1 year or so.<p>It also forces you to keep pivoting and finding a cash cow rather than assuming your initial plan was any good.

The founder raised a good amount of capital from investors a few years ago, and that provided a decent runway, but there&#x27;s no traction, no KPIs, and whilst we&#x27;ve built some impressive technology, impressive technology does not bring in revenue. One of the problems (amongst many) is that the primary stakeholder has a perfectionist attitude to the user experience. Which in a start-up is deadly.<p>Now, as I said, the start-up cannot meet its capex obligations and the current funding round is looking grim. It is definitely going to be a down round and it ain&#x27;t going to be pretty should a term sheet get thrust under our collective noses. To get the developers motivated to stick around a little longer, &quot;generous&quot; equity packages are on offer, with a request to convert over-due back pay and future payments too, into equity .<p>When I sought transparency - &quot;Can I see the cap table?&quot; - &quot;Can I see the terms of the investors?&quot; - &quot;Can I see anything?&quot; - the answer was invariably &quot;no.&quot; Essentially, they&#x27;re asking me to make a nominal investment of over $200K in the company, accepting common stock in lieu of pay without any insight into the financials or the terms provided to other investors.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that I had previously given the start-up a sweetheart deal, significantly discounting my usual rate and offering generous payment terms, in the spirit of support and belief in the project. This makes the current scenario even more disheartening. Compound that with what has become an overall toxic environment that I have euphemistically called &quot;challenging&quot; when asked to sum it up, and the future isn&#x27;t bright enough to wear shades.<p>Now this isn&#x27;t exactly my first rodeo. I&#x27;ve seen the beautiful side of start-ups and liquidity events. And I&#x27;ve seen the dreadfully ugly side too. Hard lessons learned.

I was previously at a FANG when a startup doing some really interesting work agreed to match my total comp in cash, and then gave me the equivalent in options based on their recent valuation. All fully remote.<p>At the time, the company I was at seemed to be going downhill quickly, and they began mass layoffs for the first time shortly after I left.<p>What happened since then? Well, the startup options have very likely gone to zero. And my previous company’s stock price, which had been dropping quickly over my last year there, made a hard U-turn right after I left and has been skyrocketing ever since (my family likes to joke that I caused the change of course at both companies).<p>Was it really a bad decision though? It’s sort of hard to tell. At my previous company, my manager had put together a promotion packet, but this likely would have been cancelled with the layoffs, and there’s a chance I could have been laid off as well (as far as I can tell it was random). And then there’s the fact that  even with a promotion, the new comp heavily lags the going rate of external hires at the same level for many years.<p>So at least up until now, I think I came out even with or maybe slightly ahead of the counterfactual situation where I didn’t join a startup. Plus I’ve had new experiences and different types of challenges than I had previously, and I think it’s valuable to experience a variety of these over a lifetime.<p>Obviously, from this point forward my future outlook would be better off if I had stayed, but it’s hard to write off my decision to try something new, and some other coworkers joined different startups that are likely to go public soon, so it’s not like going from FANG to startup always works out unfavorably, and if you join one that’s doing well at later stage, the risk doesn’t seem that high really.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39599912" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39599912" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mcmoor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39599509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599573">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39599804">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39600563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39599912">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39599912">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess this is why worker-coop would never really take off.

Even if they come in with what would be “a lot” of money to most of us, it can’t compete with investment capital.<p>We build energy plants with investor money as an example. They don’t invest in us, but into the projects we run, so it’s a little bit different than having someone invest in us (but I’ll get to that). We don’t solely build a power plant with investor money though, we build it with a mix of investor money, loans and our own money, and that last bit just got a whole lot larger (meaning we can do much larger projects) with private equity investing into us directly. So now instead of doing a tiny mom-and-pops sort of solar plant, we can build some of the largest solar plants in the world. The payout on the other side isn’t linear either, there is much, much, more money in a single large plant than in a hundred tiny plants. Especially when you sell the product a few years after its completion.<p>In the current world, maybe it would’ve been better to not take private equity on board, but at the time it was done, nobody knew Putin would invade, that the global supply lines and manufacturing power would never recover from covid, or, that interest rates would go above 15% in countries where they were below 1%. Everyone knew the low interest rates wouldn’t stay, but we sure didn’t expect them to go so far above 8%.<p>Anyway, even if the world hadn’t gone to shit, our company would still have been 10-20 people and not in the hundreds if we hadn’t acquired the massive amount of funds. Since while our founders are rather rich, they aren’t that rich, and this would’ve limited the company growth to such a significant degree that even two years of economic turmoil has us at a level we would’ve likely never reached. It’s not all gloom and doom either, people still need power after all.<p>So you’re both right and wrong, founders sort of become employees, but not really.

This entire story above happened for three reasons:<p>1. The CEO made terrible decisions in regards to how much and who they raised from. They got in over their hands as the company grew and the entire founding team got fired.<p>2. The CEO immediately after, who took over an unprofitable business that wasn&#x27;t growing and was in bad shape after the merger with DraftKings got called off, took a deal that was the best he could do at the time. That CEO was a non-founding CFO before taking over, and was basically put in the C-Suite by KKR as a term of their investment in the business.<p>3. That deal to PaddyPowerBetfair, now Flutter, was completed about a year before PASPA was repealed and sports betting was legalized in the US. Had #2 happened a year later, or if #2 had happened with that information in mind, the deal terms would have been insanely different and way more valuable.<p>It&#x27;s very easy in retrospect to say that the original CEO should have taken different terms, or that the following CEO should have taken a better deal.

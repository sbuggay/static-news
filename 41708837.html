Users hate them, etc.<p>These are all issues that can be improved. In the last few years there have been several CAPTCHAs that work without user input at all, and safeguard user privacy.<p>- They&#x27;re not good enough, sophisticated (AI) bots can easily bypass them, etc.<p>Sure, but even traditional techniques are useful at stopping low-effort bots. Sophisticated ones can be fought with more advanced techniques, including ML. There are products on the market that do this as well.<p>- They&#x27;re ineffective against dedicated attackers using mechanical turks, etc.<p>Well, sure, but these are entirely different attack methods. CAPTCHAs are meant to detect bots, and by definition, won&#x27;t be effective against attackers who decide to use actual humans.

For example, imagine visiting an &quot;attestor&quot; site where you can make a one-time donation of $5 to a charity of your choice, and in exchange it gives you some proof-you-spent-money tokens. Those tokens can be spent (burned) by some collaborating site (e.g. HN) to mark your account there as <i>likely</i> a human, or at least a bot whose owner will feel pain if it is banned.<p>This would be <i>far</i> more privacy-preserving that dozens of national-ID lookup systems, and despite the appearance of &quot;money for speech&quot; it could actually be _cheaper_ than whatever mix of time and bus-fare and paperwork in a &quot;free&quot; system.<p>____________<p>I imagine the big problems would be things like:<p>* How to handle fraudulent payments, e.g. someone buying tokens with a stolen credit card. Easiest fix would be some long waiting-period before the token becomes usable.<p>* How to protect against a fraudulent attestor site that just takes your money, or one whose tokens are value-less.<p>* How to protect against a fraudulent destination site that secretly harvests your proof-token for its own use, as opposed to testing&#x2F;burning it properly. Possible social fix: Put in a fake token, if the site &quot;accepts&quot; then you know it&#x27;s misbehaving.<p>* Handling decentralization, where multiple donation sites may be issuing their own tokens and multiple account-sites that may only want to support&#x2F;trust a subset of those tokens.</div><br/><div id="41716027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41716027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brian_cunnie</span><span>|</span><a href="#41710578">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41714245">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41717375">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41716027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41716027">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; you can make a one-time donation of $5 to a charity of your choice ...<p>The Alcoholics Anonymous San Francisco website had to implement CAPTCHAs on their website because scammers were making one-time donations to make sure their stolen credit cards were still valid.

Maybe not at first. But definitely gradually and definitely eventually.<p>We know that these sites&#x27; growth and stability depends on attracting human eyeballs to their property and KEEPING them there. Today, that manifests as algorithms that analyze each person&#x27;s individual behavior and level of engagement and uses that data to tweak that user&#x27;s experience to keep them latched (some might say addicted, via dopamine) to their app on the user&#x27;s device for as long as possible.<p>Dating sites have already had this down to a science for a long time. There, bots are just part of the business model and have been for two decades. It&#x27;s really easy: you promise users that you will match them with real people, but instead show them only bots and ads. The bots are programmed to interact with the users realistically over the site and say&#x2F;do everything short of actually letting two real people meet up. Because whenever a dating site successfully matches up real people, they lose customers.<p>I hope I&#x27;m wrong, but I feel that social content sites will head down the same path. The sites will determine that users who enjoy watching Reels of women in swimsuits jump on trampolines can simply generate as many as they need, and tweak the parameters of the generated video based on the user&#x27;s (perceived) preferences: age, size, swimsuit color, height of bounce, etc. But will still provide JUST enough variety to keep the user from getting bored enough to go somewhere else.<p>It won&#x27;t just be passive content that is generated, all those political flamewars and outrage threads (the meat and potatoes of social media) could VERY well ALREADY be LLM-generated for the sole purpose of inciting people to reply.

Meta spaces inevitably become the gathering point for these accounts and users, and their sheer volume ends up making public refutations and evidence sharing impossible.<p>As a result, meta becomes impossible to engage with at the level it was envisioned.<p>In my experience, all meta areas become staging grounds to target or harass moderation.

All I can tell you is that in specific cases people ask us to look into, there are usually obvious reasons not to believe this interpretation. For example would a sufficiently smart manipulator be smart enough to have been posting about Julia macros back in 2017, or the equivalent?

IME the last 18 months or so I’ve been here, this has been a welcome bastion against typical bot&#x2F;campaign activity. Nowhere in the web seems safe the last ~dozen years. Most of what I’ve written here applies to my research of foreign bot activity on social networks, particularly in election years, in which you can far more easily piece together associations between accounts and narratives and writing style and piece together a lot more dots than on a site like this - and conclude very definitively that yes, this is a bot.<p>My original comment was just meant to chime in that, in the wild the last ten years, I’ve encountered an extraordinary amount of this kind of activity (which I confirmed - I really do research this stuff on the side and have written quite a lot about it) - that would support credibility to anyone that felt they experienced bot activity on this site. I haven’t done a full test on this site yet, because I don’t think it’s allowed, but at a glance  I suspect particular topics and keywords attract swarms of voting&#x2F;downvoting stuff, which you alluded to in your post. I think the threshold of 500 upvotes to downvote is a bit low, but clearly to me what you are doing is working. I’m only writing all of this out to make it very clear I am not making any criticisms or commentary about this site and how it handles bots&#x2F;smurfs&#x2F;etc.<p>Most of my research centers around 2016,2020 political cycles. Since the invention, release, and mass distribution of LLM’s I personally think this stuff has proliferated far beyond what anyone can imagine right now, and renders most of my old methods worthless, but for now that’s just a hypothesis.<p>Again, I appreciate the moderation of this site, it’s one of the few places left I can converse with reasonably intelligent and curious people compared to the rest of the web.

I appreciate your positive outlook on these things. It helps counteract my negative one. :)<p>For example, when you say &quot;The answer to the Sufficiently Smart Manipulator is the Sufficiently Healthy Community&quot;, that sounds reasonable, but I see a few issues with it.<p>1. These individuals are undetectable by definition. They can infiltrate communities and direct conversations and opinions without raising any alarms. Sometimes these are long-term operations that take years, and involve building trust and relationships. For all intents and purposes, they may seem like just another member of the community, which they partly are. But they have an agenda that masquerades as strong opinions, and are protected by tolerance and inclusivity, i.e. the paradox of tolerance.<p>2. Because they&#x27;re difficult to detect, they can easily overrun the community. What happens when they&#x27;re a substantial percentage of it? The line between fact and fiction becomes blurry, and it&#x27;s not possible to counteract bad arguments with better ones, simply because they become a matter of opinion. Ultimately those who shout harder, in larger numbers, and are in a better position to, get heard the most.<p>These are not some conspiracy theories. Psyops and propaganda are very real and happen all around us in ways we often can&#x27;t detect. We can only see the effects like increased polarization and confusion, but are not able to trace these back to the source.<p>Moreover, with the recent advent of AI, how long until these operations are fully autonomous? What if they already are? Bots can be deployed by the thousands, and their capabilities improve every day.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure that a Sufficiently Healthy Community alone has a chance of counteracting this. I don&#x27;t have the answer either, but can&#x27;t help but see this trend in most online communities. Can we do a better job at detection?

They would rather pay more for flat rate plans. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from <i>The Case Against Micropayments</i> [1]. It&#x27;s an old paper, but human behavior hasn&#x27;t changed.<p><i>Behavioral economics, the study of what had for a long time been dismissed as the economicly irrational behavior of people, is finally becoming respectable within economics. In marketing, it has long been used in implicit ways. One
of the most relevant findings for micropayments is that consumers are willing to pay more for flat-rate plans than for metered ones. This appears to have been discovered first about a century ago, in pricing of local telephone calls [13], but was then forgotten. It was rediscovered in the 1970s in some large scale experiments done by the Bell System [3]. There is now far more evidence of this, see references in [13], [14]. As one example of this phenomenon, in the fall of 1996, AOL was forced to switch to flat rate pricing for Internet access.</i><p><i>The reasons are described in [19]:</i><p><i>What was the biggest complaint of AOL users? Not the widely mocked and irritating blue bar that appeared when members downloaded information. Not the frequent unsolicited junk e-mail. Not dropped connections. Their overwhelming gripe: the ticking clock. Users didn’t want to pay by the hour anymore. ... Case had heard from one AOL member who insisted that she was being cheated by AOL’s hourly rate pricing. When he checked her average monthly usage, he found that she would be paying AOL more under the flat-rate price of $19.95. When Case informed the user of that fact, her reaction was immediate. ‘I don’t care,’ she told an incredulous Case. ’I am being cheated by you.’</i><p><i>The lesson of behavioral economics is thus that small payments are to be avoided, since consumers are likely to pay more for flat-rate plans. This again argues against micropayments.</i><p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180222082156&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openp2p.com&#x2F;pub&#x2F;a&#x2F;p2p&#x2F;2000&#x2F;12&#x2F;19&#x2F;micropayments.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180222082156&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openp2...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-users.cse.umn.edu&#x2F;~odlyzko&#x2F;doc&#x2F;case.against.micropayments.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-users.cse.umn.edu&#x2F;~odlyzko&#x2F;doc&#x2F;case.against.micr...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41711057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41711057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joshdavham</span><span>|</span><a href="#41709757">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41711447">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41709842">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41711057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41711057">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I weep at the thought that every site will require login with sso from google (and maybe Apple if you&#x27;re lucky)<p>I think that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re going.

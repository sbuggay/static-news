Two of them are called &quot;Class Airspace&quot; and &quot;Special Use Airspace&quot;.<p>The guy who wrote the original importers for these treated them as completely separate and unrelated data. He used an internal generic tool to convert the FAA data for each kind of airspace into a format used within the company, and then wrote separate C++ code, thousands of lines of code each.<p>Thing is, the data for these two kinds of airspace is mostly identical. You could process it all with one common codebase, with separate code for only the 10% of the data that is different between the two formats.<p>When I asked him about this, he said, &quot;I have this philosophy that says if you only have two similar things, it&#x27;s best to write separate code for each. Once you get to a third, then you can think about refactoring and making some common code.&quot;<p>That is a good philosophy! I have often followed it myself.<p>But in this case, it was obvious that the two data formats were mostly the same, and there was never going to be a <i>third</i> kind of almost-identical airspace, only the two. So we had twice the code we needed.</div><br/><div id="40528380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40528380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ebolyen</span><span>|</span><a href="#40528193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40530244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40528380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40528380">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t know, that sounds like a complex kind of ingest which could be arbitrarily subtle and diverge over time for legal and bureaucratic reasons.<p>I would kind of appreciate having two formats, since what are the odds they would change together?

This may be a case where domain knowledge is helpful.<p>One of the reasons they brought me in on this project is that besides knowing how to wrangle data, I&#x27;m also an experienced pilot. So I had a good intuitive sense of the meaning and purpose of the data.<p>The part of the data that was identical is the description of the airspace boundaries. Pilots will recognize this as the famous &quot;upside down wedding cake&quot;. But it&#x27;s not just simple circles like a wedding cake. There are all kinds of cutouts and special cases.<p>Stuff like &quot;From point A, draw an arc to point B with its center at point C. Then track the centerline of the San Seriffe River using the following list of points. Finally, from point D draw a straight line back to point A.&quot;<p>The FAA would be very reluctant to change this, for at least two reasons:<p>1.

Apparently the first FAA sectional chart was published in 1930! So the data format was derived from what must have been human-readable descriptions of what to plot on the map using a compass and straightedge.<p>I just remembered a quirk of the Australian airspace data. Sometimes they want you to draw a direct line from point F to point G, but there were two different kinds of straight lines. They may ask for a great circle, a straight path on the surface of the Earth. Or a rhumb line, which looks straight on a Mercator projection but is a curved path on the Earth.<p>You would often have some of each in the very same boundary description!<p>For anyone curious about this stuff, I recommend a visit to your local municipal airport and stop by the pilot shop to buy a sectional chart of your area.</div><br/><div id="40529678" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40529678" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tass</span><span>|</span><a href="#40528193">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40529469">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40530802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40529678">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40529678">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Paper charts are great (they&#x27;re fairly cheap and printed quite nicely in the USA at least) but you can get a good look at these boundaries through online charts.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyvector.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyvector.com</a> is a good way to view these.</div><br/><div id="40529723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40529723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Stratoscope</span><span>|</span><a href="#40528193">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40529678">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40530802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40529723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40529723">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you!

No matter the mechanism (codegen, generics, macros, inheritance, ...), if you can&#x27;t give a concept a meaningful [0] name then you usually shouldn&#x27;t DRY it up with any mechanism. Your example is a technique I also use a lot, but the critical point is that you&#x27;re choosing to break out functionality which _is_ easy to name.<p>[0a] More generally, I like a concept of &quot;total&quot; functions -- those which have sensible outputs for all their inputs. It&#x27;s a bit of a tomayto&#x2F;tomahto situation defining &quot;all their inputs&quot; (e.g., I&#x27;m personally okay using a function name like `unsafe_foo` and expecting a person to read the docs, and on the other extreme some people want sensible answers to anything the type system allows you to input), but the desired end-state is that when the project&#x27;s requirements change you don&#x27;t muck around with the ABI and implementation of `count_or_maybe_sort_for_these_three_special_customers_or_else_hit_the_db(...)`, or whatever much more generic and very wrong name the method actually has; the individual components are already correct, so you make the changes at the few methods which are actually wrong given the new requirements.<p>[0b] Another way of thinking about it is whether the two things should always change in tandem. For two largely overlapping beaucratic data formats? Maybe; there&#x27;s a comment somewhere in this chain suggesting that they&#x27;ll never go out of sync, but I&#x27;m a bit paranoid of that sort of thing. For the particular data structures that are currently shared by those formats? Absolutely not; if one diverges then you can build the new structure and link it in. The old structure is still valid in its own right.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40529195" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40529195" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">magicalhippo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40528193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40529059">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40530091">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40529195">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40529195">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We&#x27;ve got a large number of customer-specific file integrations, and a lot of them are indeed very similar as the customers have the same system on the other side.

That way, we can refer to the concept or naming pattern and ensure the client will be identical across all necessary endpoints, over hoping that a million different string joins all over the place result in the same string.<p>In such a case, early or eager DRY is the correct choice, because this needs to be defined once and exactly once.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40527109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40527109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">withinboredom</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525690">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526701">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526998">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40527285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40527109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40527109">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is why you shouldn&#x27;t write one line of code, ever again. &#x2F;s<p>We&#x27;ve all been there though, at some point in our careers.

Every time I see DRY&#x27;d code, it usually makes the project it&#x27;s in more difficult to understand. It&#x27;s harder to understand where values come from, where values are changed, what parts of the codebase affect what. And that&#x27;s before trying to figure out where to change something in the right place, because it&#x27;s often unclear what other parts of the code are coupled to it through all the abstractions.<p>At a high level, at first glance, the code might look good and it &quot;makes sense&quot;. But once you want to understand what&#x27;s happening and why, you&#x27;re jumping through five different classes, two dozen methods and you still don&#x27;t know for sure until you run a test request against the API and see what shows up where in the debugger.

Coming from Perl, everything you said was true. I wanted everything in one file as much as possible, and breaking tasks off into functions just meant I had to jump around to try and rebuild the flow in my head. I spent so much time inside the debugger since reading the code would only go so far.<p>Now I work in C#, we have a lot of classes with a few functions, a lot of helper functions. Doesn&#x27;t matter since it&#x27;s so easy to use the tooling to build a mental picture - let alone refactor it in an instant if that variable name feels a bit off, or we think a function is not used (such things were always a risky exercise in Perl).<p>We refactored one insurance based project to use generic base classes extensively since all insurance shares some attributes and features - this really helped cut down complexity of changes and overall just reduced code on the screen to sift through. I had a lot of fun doing this, I&#x27;m a weirdo who almost likes deleting code more than writing it. Once you hit the lowest level it is a little less intuitive due to being generic but at the higher levels we mostly work at, it&#x27;s simpler, and rolling out a new product we get a lot of stuff for free.

At the end both best practices can be supported by using an interface (or similar construct depending on the language) in which cohesion is provided by logic that only cares about the interface and extensibility is provided by having the right interface (offload details to the specific implementations)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40526232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40526232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">englishspot</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525596">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526164">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40526232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40526232">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a pessimistic view that ultimately the only best practices that matter are the ones your boss or your tech lead likes.</div><br/><div id="40526325" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40526325" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jkaptur</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525596">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40526325">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40526325">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What about when you are the boss or tech lead?</div><br/><div id="40526480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40526480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">znkr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525596">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526325">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40526480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40526480">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Then the only best practices that matter are the ones that your team believes are correct</div><br/><div id="40527051" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40527051" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rvnx</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525596">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526480">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40527051">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40527051">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The best practices are the ones that allow you to do business and where the maintenance work is relatively not too painful considering the budgeted development time.<p>Your task is to deliver a good product, not necessarily good code.</div><br/><div id="40527979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40527979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">englishspot</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525596">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40527051">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40527979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40527979">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The best practices are the ones that allow you to do business and where the maintenance work is relatively not too painful considering the budgeted development time.<p>the problem is even that in concrete terms can be controversial. everyone wants to minimize maintenance work; not everyone agrees on what kind of code will achieve that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40531404" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531404" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p1necone</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525596">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526232">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528338">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531404">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531404">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Cohesion over extensibility.<p>Imo the very best approach is a codebase that&#x27;s small enough that you can just do chunky refactors every so often rather than building in extensibility as a &quot;thing&quot;.

My deadline validator enforces that deadlines are in the future and are aligned with midnight UTC, to ensure correct date calculations in the database. The deadline validator Sam is working on does not enforce those restrictions.

In fact, Sam&#x27;s validator only checks that a deadline string has the expected format and is within twenty years of the present day.

You lose absolutely nothing. If you later want to handle the two cases differently, most IDEs allow you to inline the set_deadline method in a single key stroke.<p>So the argument from the article...<p>&gt; Applying DRY principles too rigidly leads to premature abstractions that make future changes more complex than necessary.<p>...does not apply to this example.<p>There clearly <i>are</i> kinds of DRY code that are less easy to reverse. Maybe we should strive for DRY code that can be easily transformed into WET (Write Everything Twice) code.<p>(Although I haven&#x27;t worked with LISPs, macros seem to provide a means of abstraction that can be easily undone without risk: just macro-expand them)<p>In my experience, it can be much harder to transform WET code into DRY code because you need to resolve all those little inconsistencies between once-perfect copies.</div><br/><div id="40530902" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40530902" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">epr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40526831">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40529034">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531402">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40530902">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40530902">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can only assume the Google example would be part of a script&#x2F;cli program that is meant to crash with an error on a bad parameter or similar.

Instead of coming up with fancy names for things, I try to call it by the simplest name to describe what it&#x27;s currently doing, which can be difficult and is subjective.<p>If we wanted to define a function which crashes like the example, I would probably write this:<p><pre><code>    def throw_past_datetime(dt):

If the point is not to crash&#x2F;throw for control flow reasons, I&#x27;d write this in non-cli&#x2F;script code instead of defining a function:<p><pre><code>    dt = datetime(2024, 5, 29)

Because of the manual nature of the job and the way data was presented in the terminal there were errors, which were really unpredictable. I was not allowed to talk to the person doing this job or visit them in their office so it took me three months to find out that what was shown on the terminal screen was essentially a 80x25 version of a punchcard and that position of the fields mattered. Sometimes the user would not copy the whole screen, sometimes there would be an extra character added while pasting data into Excel (not always a stray &quot;v&quot;), sometimes a gremlin character would be added between the mainframe and the terminal (there must have been a serial connection somewhere). Forget proper encoding, JSON or XML, it was raw data, really raw. When I started working on the pipeline it would break on every incorrectly formatted record, when I finished the job and left it was only barfing on 5% bad records and those that it could not process would be neatly put aside an emailed to the support people responsible for  dealing with this client. There was a lot of repetition initially, but I then discovered patterns (random offsets, encoding errors, extra characters) and that allowed me to build a set of generic classes to quickly implement problem-specific handlers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40531606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nfw2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40532313">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40527046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The main benefit of abstraction isn&#x27;t to reduce keystrokes; it&#x27;s to break a program into comprehensible chunks of operation.<p>Routines that are conceptually identical should share an abstraction.

More recently I&#x27;ve been practicing SPOT (Single Point of Truth). I interpret this in two ways. One, every piece of data should have a location that reigns over all others. It&#x27;s okay to have duplicates of the data, such as caches, but any copies of that data should be treated as ephemeral and possibly inconsistent with the source of truth. Second, there is some overlap with DRY where some logic that answers a question or computes a result should not be duplicates. A specific function or class which computes something important, should probably not be duplicates, but implemented once and reused. A great example is authentication, you most likely should not duplicate code that checks whether a user is authorized to do something. In a sense, the code which computes whether a user is authorized in itself becomes a &quot;source of truth&quot;.<p>There are still good reasons to DRY early on. Actions that need to be performed synchronously, rather than acquiring the same lock in several places, consolidate your code so you&#x27;re so there&#x27;s at most a few places you acquire and release that lock. Cache invalidation, having a single class for reading and writing some piece of data makes it much easier to keep the cache consistent.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40527485" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40527485" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kag0</span><span>|</span><a href="#40531053">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526195">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40527485">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40527485">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience DRY and many (any?) other coding principles are only problematic when misused. They&#x27;re typically misused because the user doesn&#x27;t understand the motivation or underlying value of the principle in the first place.<p>I think the example in the article does a bit of that as well. The example sets a deadline on a thing (a task or payment) by validating the deadline against the current time, and then presumably doing something else that isn&#x27;t shown. The article argues that in the future a task might have different validation requirements than a payment, and they&#x27;re only coincidentally the same today; so it would be foolish to abstract the deadline setting logic today.   
BUT, the reality is that the real coincidence is that payments and tasks have the same set of validations, not that the logic to validate a deadline is coincidentally the same. In my opinion &quot;good&quot; code would be fine to have separate set_task_deadline and set_payment_deadline methods, but only one validate_deadline_is_in_future (or whatever) method, alongside other validation methods which can be called as appropriate by each set_x_deadline implementation.<p>Disclaimer: the code is so short and trivial that it doesn&#x27;t matter, I think we can all assume that this concept is extrapolated onto a bigger problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40526195" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40526195" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watters</span><span>|</span><a href="#40527485">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40526195">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40526195">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reads like a paraphrase of this widely circulated post from 8 years agoâ¦<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandimetz.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;1&#x2F;20&#x2F;the-wrong-abstraction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandimetz.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;1&#x2F;20&#x2F;the-wrong-abstraction</a></div><br/><div id="40528246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40528246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmeijboom</span><span>|</span><a href="#40526195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40526010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40528246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40528246">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks!

The point isn&#x27;t to build a million abstractions; it&#x27;s to find the places where you have duplication and de-duplicate it, or where you know there&#x27;ll be duplication and abstract it, or to simply rearchitect&#x2F;redesign to avoid complexity and duplication. This applies to code, data models, interfaces, etc.<p>The duplication is typically bad because it leads to inconsistency which leads to bugs. If your code is highly cohesive and loosely coupled, this is less likely [across independent components].<p>And on this:<p>&gt; When designing abstractions, do not prematurely couple behaviors<p>Don&#x27;t <i>ever</i> couple behaviors, unless it&#x27;s within the same component. Keep your code highly cohesive and loosely coupled. Once it&#x27;s complete, wall it off from the other components with a loosely-coupled interface. Even if that means repeating yourself. But don&#x27;t let anyone make the mistake of thinking they both work the same because they have similar-looking interfaces or behaviors, or you will be stuck again in the morass of low cohesion. This is probably one of the 3 biggest problems in software design.<p>Libraries are a great help here, but libraries <i>must</i> be both backwards compatible, and not tightly coupled. Lack of backwards compatibility is probably the 4th biggest problem...</div><br/></div></div><div id="40532430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">janaagaard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40526010">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40528776">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532430">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t use DRY but WET: Write Everything Twice. :o)<p>In practice: The second time you implement something, start out by copy-pasting the first implementation.

</code></pre>
which is of course an academic example but that I&#x27;ve seen in many kind of e-business application.  Nobody ever seems to think of it until later but two obvious requirements are:  (1) query to see what state a user was in at a given time,  (2) show the history of a given user.  The code to do that in the above is highly complex and will change every time a new state gets added.  The customer also has experiences like &quot;we had a student who took two leaves of absence&quot; or &quot;some students apply,  get rejected,  apply again,  then get accepted&quot;  When you find data designs like this you also tend to find some of the records are corrupted and when you are recovering the history of users there will be some you&#x27;ll never get right.<p>If you think before you code you might settle on this design<p><pre><code>    create table history (
       student_id                         integer primary key,
       status                             integer not null,
       begin_date                         datetime not null,
       end_date                           datetime
    )
</code></pre>
which solves the above problems and many others in most situations.  (For one thing the obvious queries are trivial and event complex queries about times and events can be written with the better schema.)  I can&#x27;t decide if the thing I hate the most about being a programmer is having to clean up messes like the above or having to argue with other developers about why the first example is wrong.<p>If &quot;No code&quot; is to really be revolutionary it&#x27;s going to have to have built-in ontologies so that programmers get correct data structures for situations like the above that show up everyday in everyday bizaps where there is a clear right answer but it is usually ignored.</div><br/><div id="40526092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40526092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gls2ro</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525321">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40525652">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40525528">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40526092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40526092">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Two points here just for fine grain discussion:<p>1.

That query is harder for the second one.  On the other hand figuring out what state a user was in at time <i>t</i> could be a very hard problem with the first table.<p>My experience with the first is that you find corrupted data records,  one cause of that will be that people will cut and paste the SQL queries so maybe 10% of the time they wind up updating the wrong date.  Systems like that also seem to have problems with data entry mistakes.<p>The biggest advantage of #2 is ontological and not operational,  which is that in a business process an item is usually in exactly one state out of a certain set of possible states.  Turns out that this invariant influences the set of reasonable requirements that people could write, the subconscious expectations of what users expect, needs to be implicitly followed by an application,  etc.<p>Granted some of the dates I listed up there don&#x27;t quite correspond to a state change,  for instance the system needs to keep track of when a student started an application and when the last document (transcripts, letters, etc.) has been received.  With 5 documents you would have 32 possible states of received or not and that&#x27;s unreasonable,  particularly considering that a student with just one letter and a very strong application in every other way might get accepted despite that.  It&#x27;s fair to say the student can have an &quot;open application&quot; and a &quot;complete application&quot;.  Similarly you could say the construction of an airplane or a nuclear power plant can be defined by several major phases but that these systems have many parts installed so if the left engine is installed but the right engine is not installed these are properties of the left and right engine as opposed to the plane.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40525528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40525528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ldjkfkdsjnv</span><span>|</span><a href="#40525321">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40525397">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40525488">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40525528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40525528">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Abstraction too early is usually a mistake, no one is smart enough to predict all the possible edge cases.

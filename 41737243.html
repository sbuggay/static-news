Both went with “books” on how to use them, together with all of the unlimited time you have when you’re a kid.<p>This transferred to my first PC and eventually I learned how FAT, DOS, BIOS work, how to make a TSR and fool around B8000&#x2F;A0000, first steps with 386+. It also helped that my granddad was an impulse electronics engineer and taught me how actual gates work and how computers count, sum and select numbers. He also had access to multiple books on hardware. I knew it all down to the silicon.<p>Other people had all sorts of magical ideas on how computers work. Special “hidden system areas”, “graphics card does X”, “computers multiply by addition”, etc etc. It’s a human thing that if we don’t understand something, our mind tries to yadda yadda it.<p>And the more you yadda yadda, the less chances it leaves that you’ll actually learn it. I tend to fight with these half-baked autogenerated explanations and try to dig down to how it really works. For no particular reason, that’s just what I like to do. It leaves a mark on how you work though.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41739145" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41739145" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shermantanktop</span><span>|</span><a href="#41739072">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41739145">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41739145">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So many frameworks and dev-oriented features are sold with the claim that domain X is super complicated and full of esoteric useless trivia, so instead someone has put a clean facade on that which simplifies everything and protects the hapless dev from having to learn. Which is nice, it’s a tidy abstraction, we all have other things to do, now we go fast.<p>Except…the dev has to learn the new API, which we can call domain Y, and which can become quite complicated and hard to map conceptually to domain X (e.g. React events vs browser rendering, or Java GC vs real memory).<p>And when the cool facade doesn’t quite work for some exotic use case, now what?  The dev gets to learn the original domain X anyway, plus how X and Y interact.  In the worst case they have rewrite all their Y-using code.<p>Great abstractions are good magic; bad abstractions are evil magic. And yet good vs evil is often hard to tell apart when you pick up the problem.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

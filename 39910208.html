But still not that helpful.<p>It is helpful to people that are not aware of the source of the stress (often in the form of feeling overwhelmed) to be able to identify it. The article spend most of the words actually just describing this phenomenon. I think newly-graduated-in-tech-startup me in the past would&#x27;ve felt validated reading it.<p>But the article falls short on any good remedies for the situation. Like yeah I&#x27;d love to be able to just &quot;not worry about it&quot;, but the problem is that I (as a researcher needing to keep up) can&#x27;t just stop worrying about it, but I&#x27;d love to find a balance where I can keep the enthusiasm and up to date while not feeling overwhelmed and dreadful while doing it.<p>It works for the author because ultimately, the author is in a position when they can walk away or explain WHY they don&#x27;t keep up and get accepted for it. Worst case the author will lose respect or some snobbish friends.<p>That&#x27;s not the case for most tech or research people. Not worrying about it might be close to just quitting (or silent quitting) and require a bit more mental change than &quot;to not just worry about it&quot;.

The moment you deeply believe that only stress will improve your life situation, you have made a decision for it to be so. This is the mechanism by which the stress then proliferates not only in you, but also to others. And you don&#x27;t even get a guarantee that it&#x27;s worth it. You may end up with only stress and all the goals you tried to achieve with it falling apart anyway. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.

My manager raised my non-participation as an example of how my attitude was turning too negative for the team.

Amidst New York&#x27;s vibrant book scene, a place of lit gossip and subway commutes, the author encounters the double-edged sword of being part of a community that both enriches and, at times, imposes unwelcome pressures. With a critique as much of Goodreads&#x27; role in transforming reading into a competitive sport as of the social media-induced urge to keep up, the piece eloquently argues for a return to reading as an unquantifiable, personal journey, a haven from the public eye and a refuge in the joy of books for their own sake.â</div><br/></div></div><div id="39938242" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39938242" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39938203">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39940228">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938250">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39938242">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39938242">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ironically itâs because increasingly itâs 100 words generated by an LLM from a 10 word prompt.

It criticizes the way platforms like Goodreads have turned reading into a quantifiable task, with people feeling pressure to read a certain number of books per year. The author argues that reading should be about the experience and personal enjoyment, not about keeping up with others or hitting reading goals.

She describes how, as an adult, reading has become entangled with competition, social performance, and the need to keep up with trends, turning the solitary pleasure of reading into a public performance marked by obligations and quantifiable achievements.<p>Templeton criticizes the way platforms like Goodreads have transformed reading into a task-oriented activity, where success is measured by the number of books read, detracting from the intrinsic value of reading itself. She shares personal anecdotes from her time in New York&#x27;s bookish circles, where she felt the pressure to be well-read and current, highlighting the anxiety that can come with trying to meet external expectations.<p>Templeton recalls a turning point when being asked about her recent reads felt more like a competition than a shared interest, prompting her to reevaluate her relationship with reading. She argues for a reading culture that values personal experience over productivity, emphasizing that the number of books one reads should not dictate one&#x27;s worth as a reader.<p>Templeton advocates stepping away from the competitive and overwhelming aspects of online book communities to reclaim reading as a personal, unquantifiable joy. Her reflections serve as a reminder that the true value of reading lies in the individual growth, enjoyment, and insights it provides, far beyond any statistic or social media status.</div><br/><div id="39938531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39938531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voisin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39938203">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938491">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39938531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39938531">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So many of the same things apply to running&#x2F;Strava and living&#x2F;Instagram.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39938690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39938690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caskstrength</span><span>|</span><a href="#39938203">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938491">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938531">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39938629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39938690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39938690">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Templeton recalls a turning point when being asked about her recent reads felt more like a competition than a shared interest, prompting her to reevaluate her relationship with reading.

Many metrics suffer from the glass half full vs half empty, perspective! They&#x27;re just numbers at the end of the day. The important part is how you let them inform you. It is so easy to have the number goes up === good mentality, but many metrics hide the subjective and or collective truth. People need to take metrics in aggregate.

(Leave aside the many people in letters who come from a wealthy family; you will meet many of these people in Global Alpha cities, like London, NYC, Tokyo, etc.)  Instead, they create a navel gazing world of intellectual status where they try to &quot;read more than everyone else&quot; and &quot;have a strong opinion about everything&quot;.  Thus, their peers &quot;feel behind&quot;.  I think this also well explains why the people in the letters, especially journalists, think Twitter is &quot;so important&quot;.  It is not.  It is tiny echo-chamber in a massive online world.<p>I want to be very clear about what I wrote above: I am not criticizing the quality of their work.  There are plenty of people in the letters who annoy me to no end with their navel gazing, but produce fantastic work.  Please keep these two separate!<p>The best part of this article: She realises it is all bullshit.  In short: Read what you like.  And, don&#x27;t worry too much about other people.

Because gamifying social interaction is a pretty good definition of sociopathy.

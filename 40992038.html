However, the presentation is really bad, in a way where it is actually making very difficult to grasp the content.
The actual main information from the graphs is hard to read (why isn&#x27;t it showing all numbers?), with colors that are too similar. It does not support the niceties that html chart provide (like dynamic filtering or alternate views).
It is really hard to find where we are in the article, so going back and forth is painful. 
In terms of accessibility it is also quite bad as it does not show the charts.

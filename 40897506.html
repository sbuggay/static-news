In a city full of empty office spaces on a weekday night it was virtually impossible to find a stable meeting location. Without a stable meeting location you are much less likely to establish a core group since people do not like to have to learn how to get to different venues.
Mozilla hosted us at one point but the political tides changed there and we got kicked out. I think having strong buy in from someone in the C-suite of a company is the only real way to do it. Otherwise you are beholden to the changing winds of the company.<p>In the end we are now in a stable location in the local library, but only because we had someone on the inside. Previously when we approached the library we were stone walled without someone to grease the wheels.<p>I do believe that it should be a mandate for the municipality to provide meeting space for local non-profit and special interest groups. In many locations you can no longer pool some money with your buddies to buy a piece of land to build your clubhouse on. In my city there are many such clubs which were formed 50 years ago — the sailing club, the badminton club, the lawn bowling club, etc — but land is too scarce in many places now and we need the municipalities to pick up the slack.</div><br/><div id="40898877" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40898877" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">packetlost</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40898877">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40898877">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I do believe that it should be a mandate for the municipality to provide meeting space for local non-profit and special interest groups.<p>I never realized this was something that was needed so bad, but yeah. In my city we have a bunch of privately owned venues that you can <i>rent</i>, but the cost ranges from reasonable to very <i>not</i> reasonable. To be fair, a lot of my local technical meetups just hang out at one of the quieter restaurant&#x2F;bars in the area and it seems to work ok for them. The downside is you don&#x27;t have any way to present anything. Another group I regularly go to is a local DefCon chapter that rents out space above a &quot;barcade&quot; (arcade + bar) and aside from being a bit hot in the summer, the vibes are great and the community doubly so.</div><br/><div id="40902615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40902615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">senderista</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898727">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40898877">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40898937">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40902615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40902615">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have been to meetups at bars&#x2F;restaurants and it was impossible for me to follow conversations due to moderate hearing loss.

We survived covid, having to move venues multiple times, and the declining sexiness of Ruby. Thanks so much to our sponsors Mojotech (for space and drinks) and Github (for zoom). We&#x27;re still looking for other sponsors for pizza support--if you are in the Boulder area and are interested, please reach out.<p>The meetup is smaller than it was pre-covid, but it is still a great community. We have newer members, one time visitors (often from a bootcamp, looking for work) and regulars. It&#x27;s a good mix, and the social chatting before the talks are one of the grat . I actually have enjoyed having a zoom option (for when you can&#x27;t get to the meetup or to pull in speakers from out of town with no budget), but the in-person experience is far better.<p>I wrote up some tips for wrangling speakers here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mooreds.com&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;archives&#x2F;3283" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mooreds.com&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;archives&#x2F;3283</a> because that is what I focused on. It&#x27;s actually fun to reach out to folks and offer up the opportunity to speak. I never had problems with devrels doing talks, myself, as long as it was super clear that it wasn&#x27;t a vendor pitch, but rather a discussion of some technical issue. (I was a devrel, so maybe that is why it didn&#x27;t bother me?) But having a required corp speaker is a clear no-go for me.<p>That&#x27;s a bummer your library was an obstacle. I worry a bit about mandates because many meetups are not formal non-profits. The best thing to do is to keep costs low and look for companies who recognize the value in fostering community. They&#x27;re out there! Consulting companies are good options because of their business model :) .<p>We still use meetup.com because inertia, but the recent price increases makes it seem like it got acquired by Broadcom.

But I quickly got disillusioned. Almost every meetup was varying degrees of startups pitching their product. The last straw for me was sitting through a talk at a JavaScript meetup that was by a devrel employee of a startup who literally gave a tutorial for their product.<p>My favorite local meetups fell to problems like this.<p>It was easy to filter out the DevRel people trying to advertise. The hard problem was filtering out people who were only interested in presenting something so they could show another presentation on their resume or personal brand website, with no interest in engaging with the meetup.<p>These people would want to only show up for the one meetup where they got to present. They’d present some simple content designed to make them look good, with little regard to educating or discussing things. They’d often have some excuse for needing to leave quickly after presenting, some times before any QA time.<p>And they always needed a video recording of themselves speaking. For a while we had these to stream to remote viewers, but if the camera gear wasn’t available they’d panic and spend a lot of time improvising a way to record it with their phone even if delayed the presentation. Getting the recording of themselves speaking was the primary goal, not actually speaking to the group.<p>After this happens enough times, the core members realize they’re being used as audience props for someone’s career advancement and they stop coming. The meetup collapses.<p>I hope my local meetup groups can have a little resurgence like this where people are primarily interested in the meetup, not the self promotion opportunity.</div><br/><div id="40899151" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40899151" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ssivark</span><span>|</span><a href="#40897897">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40900214">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40899151">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40899151">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There seem to be a few obvious tweaks to try:<p>1.

This is a great post.  What so many of the developer relations people miss: Don&#x27;t focus on the sales pitch so much.  Focus on a good technical problem that will be relevant to your audience.

I think we&#x27;d have trouble attracting the high quality speakers we do today if we set restrictions some commenters have suggested such as attending the meetup multiple times, not mentioning the company, etc.<p>We&#x27;re pretty picky with speakers we invite but also quite flexible once we&#x27;ve invited someone we think will be good.

Since we have made the decision of being a MUNICH BASED IN PERSON club to get the maximum networking and social experience, we also wanted to make sure our actual club members will fulfill these criteria. That&#x27;s why we have the paper form in person policy.<p>There will be some member-only events but those are more social events or maybe ones with very limited spots but usually access to events will be public.<p>Our events are not exclusively on the Garching campus. As you already found out we have two major formats:<p>1. The weekly paper reading group which is mostly researchers (mostly PhD students, sometimes professors) presenting their research or a single paper. Some weeks we have industry talks instead. These events are in Garching and only during the lecture period because they are mostly targeted towards students (we are a student club after all) so that they can learn more about the very relevant database research that is happening at TUM and how it&#x27;s applied in industry.<p>2. Monthy or bi-monthy Munich Database Meetups which are more targeted towards industry and bringing together industry, students and researchers from academia. Those events will usually have more than one talk unlike our weekly events, the talks will mostly have speakers from industry (usually 2). They will usually be somewhere in the city center of Munich to make sure industry people will get there easier. We usually try to get some location at some company. We already had them at CodeCentric, Google and JetBrains.<p>For both formats we try to make sure we get deep technical talks about mostly database systems internals. For the research talks they are usually very deeply technical anyway and for the industry talks (including meetups) we are working on guidelines to make sure they know what type of talk we expect.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40902692" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40902692" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway2037</span><span>|</span><a href="#40898008">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40898187">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40900634">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40899511">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40902692">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40902692">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>    &gt; The events are at the university campus which is quite off, and makes it relatively inconvenient to get there if you are not at the university anyway.

No shade to OP, but even though this is what pissed them off about their JS meetup, they&#x27;re still doing it by having their speakers essentially pitch joining their engineering team.<p>The other side of the coin is that default advice on the internet for getting a job as a developer used to include &quot;go to local developer meetups&quot;, and as a founder&#x2F;business, it&#x27;s an obvious idea to see developer meetups as a potential marketing&#x2F;recruiting channel. So a lot of attendees do actually want jobs, and a lot of speakers want to give people jobs. But will people stick around once they get that job? And is job-oriented content really what you want out of a meetup as a consistent attendee?<p>I wonder if some combination of reading groups, a process to get regular attendees to present, and hackathons might create a more sustainable programming meetup culture. It can still be corporate funded (eg have it in their building or shout them out or cobrand or whatever) but the content could be a lot more interesting. It might not work for Javascript, but systems programming actually intersects with a lot of published research and has more of a hacker culture, so I think you could pull it off.

Janrain had a great meetup space (old Nike basketball court with risers) with awesome tech topics that exposed the vast world of tech to a noob like me.  Puppet Labs, Urban Airship, and New Relic also had top-tier meetups.  Intel in Hillsboro was usually worth the MAX trip out there.  Tons of swag, food, and opportunities for employment.<p>The real issue with these meetups is that the money dried up.  Most of the meetups had recruiters who were desperate to hire and sponsorship helped fund these meetups.  Now that WFH is widely acceptable, there’s little incentive to court talent locally.  Zoom meetups feel inorganic and lifeless, although they cost very little.  There was a gold rush feel during the 2010’s, but I feel like that time is over.  Cost-cutting, outsourcing, and the AI hype are leading to software becoming a less prestigious career than it once was.

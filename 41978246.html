I think I was in 2nd grade and had just learned how to read. Very early 80&#x27;s.<p>I recall that my arts teacher told me about Lem in 4th grade when I was drawing some spaceship and I told her I already read some books by him. She didn&#x27;t believe me until I told her details about the stories.<p>&quot;The Invincible&quot; was mind blowing at that age and set a pretty high standard for everything in that genre I read after.<p>I still think my dad left it laying on the living room table intentionally for me to find.
He had almost everything Lem had written until then and was probably fed up with me reading the pulp kids&#x2F;teen sci-fi that I was at the time.<p>As I grew up in Germany pretty much all of Lems works were readily available in German, which definitely helped.<p>Speaking of Lem adaptions: I was already doing computer graphics&#x2F;VFX in my early 20&#x27;s when I gave reading &quot;Solaris&quot; another try (it had been too long in the tooth for me in parts as a teen).<p>And I recall the visual description of the ocean at multiple scales (it&#x27;s two pages or more) and though: that will take years for VFX tools to get to the stage where we can visualize that.<p>I&#x27;d say we&#x27;ve only been there since less than a decade.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41980113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">krige</span><span>|</span><a href="#41981069">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41981014">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980113">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The game is superb.

Its pacing, presentation, and writing are top notch. Overall I feel that it&#x27;s worth a try whether you know the original story or not. Knowing the book will spoil a lot of the, let&#x27;s call them twists, very quickly, but will also provide interesting context for things shown before the protagonist finds things out on her own.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41981014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41981014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceving</span><span>|</span><a href="#41980113">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41981014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41981014">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If it is truly following Stanislaw Lem&#x27;s ideas it will be quite frustrating, because no player will be able to succeed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41980913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blueflow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41981014">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41978665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980913">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is nowhere near canon, but the Planet from &quot;The Invincible&quot; could easily be Fulgora from &quot;Factorio: Space Age&quot;, some tenths of thousand years later.

Situations that called for such an eventuality, even on a scale of the entire tonnage of the space base, could be counted on the fingers of one hand. In the jargon used on board, sending out the Cyclops for some task meant the same certainty as entrusting it to the Devil himself. No one had ever heard of any Cyclops failing.<p>&gt; the black scrub on the slopes began to smoke and set off in waves toward the vehicle from Earth, coming on with such vehemence that in the first instant the Cyclops disappeared completely, concealed by what looked like a cape of tarry smoke flung from above. At once, however, a ragged flash lit up the entire breadth of the attacking cloud. This was not the Cyclops using its terrible weaponry, merely the cloud’s energy fields striking against the force field.<p>&gt; Out of the corner of his eye, Rohan saw the commander open his mouth to ask the Chief Engineer standing next to him if the field would hold out—but the words didn’t come. He didn’t have time.<p>&gt; The black whirlwind, the walls of the ravine, the bushes—all of it disappeared in a split second. It looked as if a volcano breathing fire had opened up in a fissure in the rock. A column of smoke and frothing lava, shattered rocks, and finally, immense white billows of steam that probably came from the boiling waters of the stream, soared a mile into the air to where the TV relay was hovering. The Cyclops had activated its antimatter cannon.</div><br/><div id="41978777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41978777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">braiamp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41978677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980523">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41978777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41978777">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I haven&#x27;t played the game because my 11th-gen Intel Framework 13 isn&#x27;t that fast for running newer games<p>Interesting.

I read this book over the summer (and also discovered in the process that my library also has a collection of Lem in Polish too! Too bad I don’t know Polish). I suppose as long as they are focusing on an “atmospheric retelling” of the story, it doesn’t really matter that none of Lem’s stories ever end in human triumph. This one ends mostly in confusion and failure.<p>I also recently learned that there was a new English translation of Solaris. This version is much-hyped for being closer to the original, but as I read it, I am finding that I preferred the original translation (even though Lem himself reportedly did not like it). Anyway, huge Lem fan. Maybe an immersive game-like experience will better serve Lem’s visions. I was sorely disappointed in Soderbergh’s awful film version of Solaris.

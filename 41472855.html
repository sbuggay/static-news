However, for my personal equipment, itâs really difficult for me to stomach paying Appleâs inflated prices for RAM upgrades beyond their defaults (8GB wonât cut it for my workloads, and even 16GB sometimes feels cramped), and because the RAM is soldered, I have no choice but to either accept the default or to pay inflated prices for more RAM.  Thus after 16 years of buying Macs for home use, I switched away from the Mac a few years ago; I have a Ryzen 9 build as my daily-driving desktop and a Framework 13 as my laptop.  My Framework has 32GB of RAM and I can upgrade to 64GB at any time.  I admit that I miss macOS at times, but WSL has dramatically improved the Windows experience for me.<p>I loved my 2006 MacBook.

While it didnât have expansion slots, I did upgrade the RAM during the pandemic from 12GB to 64GB, which was wonderful!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41478458" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41478458" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjmlp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41473103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41476765">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41476958">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41476409">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41478458">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41478458">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Squeak originally made use of the Smalltalk-80 image from Smalltalk, that is how it descends from real Smalltalk, versus the other Smalltalk vendors that are still around (not sure how they created their versions).<p>This also applies to Pharo, at least for the initial versions as they forked out of Squeak.<p>Clascal came to be, because Smalltalk was too demanding for Lisa&#x27;s hardware.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41476409" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41476409" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41473103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41475808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41475942">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41475164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41476409">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41476409">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">i don&#x27;t think they were unrelated; the groups developing them were in constant contact and had thick webs of mutual acquaintances.  teitelman had grown up at mit before going off to parc to write interlisp, and parc was full of former arpa researchers<p>i do think they made noticeably (and fascinatingly) different choices not only in what they designed for their user interfaces but also what they thought of as a good user interface<p>other lispm-related links, other than the one lispm posted above:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lisper&#x2F;cpus-caddr">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lisper&#x2F;cpus-caddr</a> #Lisp machine #gateware for the MIT CADR in modern #Verilog.  âBoots and runs.â  By #lisper (Brad Parker)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metebalci.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cadr-lisp-machine-and-cadr-processor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metebalci.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cadr-lisp-machine-and-cadr-proces...</a> #CADR #Lisp-machine #retrocomputing<p>at some point i came across a treasure trove of lispm screenshots showing many aspects of the genera ui, but apparently it&#x27;s not in my bookmarks file<p>one quibble: i don&#x27;t think flavors was around until quite a bit later, maybe 01979, so the lispm software wasn&#x27;t oo until quite late.  weinreb and moon&#x27;s aim-602 on it wasn&#x27;t until 01980: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.dtic.mil&#x2F;sti&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ADA095523.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.dtic.mil&#x2F;sti&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ADA095523.pdf</a> and of the five keywords they chose to describe it, one was &#x27;smalltalk&#x27;</div><br/><div id="41476498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41476498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lispm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41473103">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41476409">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41475164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41476498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41476498">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; i do think they made noticeably (and fascinatingly) different choices not only in what they designed for their user interfaces but also what they thought of as a good user interface<p>Though software written originally for the Xerox Interlisp systems got ported to the MIT Lisp Machine descendants, since the hardware was more capable with more memory.

The Xerox Interlisp-D machine was a Lisp Machine with the specific microcode. It was a Smalltalk machine and a Mesa machine - each with their microcode.<p>The original MIT Lisp machine was also microcoded, though I don&#x27;t know other Microcode than the one for Lisp. The early Symbolics Lisp Machines were also microcoded, but again only for the Lisp OS, with the microcode evolving over time to support features of Common Lisp, Prolog and CLOS.<p>There were complaints that the Microcode on the Lisp Machines was very complex, which contributed to the death of the machines.

And there&#x27;s a &quot;256 way branch on the next byte in the opcode file&quot; microcode instruction. The core of the thing is some standard AMD bitslice ALUs, but the board as a whole is clearly designed to let you implement a fast p-code interpreter.<p>The other thing the CPU board is designed for is fast graphics -- the rasterop hardware is set up so that with the right carefully designed microcode sequences it can do a &#x27;load two sources, do a logical op and write to destination&#x27; as fast as the memory subsystem will let you do the 64 bit memory operations. It takes about four CPU cycles to do a memory operation, so you kick it off, do other microcode ops in the meantime, and then you can read the result in the microinsn that executes in 4 cycles&#x27; time. The rasterops microcode source code is all carefully annotated with comments about which T state each isnn executes in, so it stays in sync with the memory cycles.<p>The other fun thing is that the microcode sequencer gives you a branch &quot;for free&quot; in most insns -- there&#x27;s a &quot;next microinsn&quot; field that is only sometimes used for other purposes.

(someone should tell csis about tsmc), and makes the kirin 9000s, founded 02000 in shanghai.  smee, (&#x27;the most advanced chinese lithography company&#x27; âcsis) founded 02002 in shanghai. mobileye, founded in jerusalem in 01999.  biren, the strategic gpu maker, founded 02019 in shanghai.  moore threads, the <i>other</i> strategic gpu maker, founded 02020 in beijing.  unisoc (spreadtrum), fourth largest cellphone cpu company, founded 02001 in shanghai.  tenstorrent, founded 02016 in toronto.  zhaoxin, the amd64 vendor, founded 02013 in shanghai.  changxin (innotron), the dram vendor, founded 02016 in hefei.  fujian jinhua, the other dram vendor, founded 02016 in, unsurprisingly, fujian, i think in fuzhou.  raspberry pi, founded 02009 in cambridge (uk).  ymtc, the nand vendor, founded 02016 in wuhan.  wingtech, the parent company of nexperia (previously philips), founded 02006 in jiaxing.  huahong, founded 01996 in shanghai.  phytium, makers of feiteng, founded 02014 in tianjin.  oculus, founded 02012 in los angeles.  zte, founded 01985 in shenzhen.  gigadevice, founded 02005 in beijing.  piotech, founded 02010 in shenyang.  amec, founded 02004 in shanghai.  ingenic, founded 02005 in beijing.  silan, founded 01997 in hangzhou.  nexchip, founded 02015 in hefei.  united nova technology, founded 02018 in shaoxing.  cetc, the defense contractor, founded 02002 in beijing.  naura, the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturer in china, founded 02001 in beijing.<p>maybe my sampling here is not entirely unbiased, but we have 7 companies in beijing, 7 in shanghai, 6 in shenzhen, 2 in hangzhou, 2 in hefei, 2 in fuzhou, and then one each in each of wuxi, zhuhai, hsinchu, nanjing, silicon valley, jerusalem, cambridge, wuhan, toronto, jiaxing, tianjin, los angeles, and shaoxing.  that seems like 19 cities where you could plausibly start a new computer maker today, given that somebody did in the last 30 years.  did the usa ever have that many in the 01970s?<p>to me this doesn&#x27;t support your thesis &#x27;countries had to reinforce their champion cities so they can compete against other champion cities [resulting in] the redlining of 98% of america and similar phenomena in those countries as well&#x27; so that &#x27;focus on (...) international competition [promoted] interregional inequality in countries&#x27;.  rather the opposite: it looks like winning the international competition and heavy state investment has resulted in increasingly widespread computer-making startups throughout china, mostly in the prc, while computer makers founded elsewhere in the last few decades mostly failed.  i mean, yes, none of these startups are in xinjiang or mississippi.  but they&#x27;re not all in one province of china, either; they&#x27;re distributed across hebei province (sort of!), jiangsu, anhui, hubei, zhejiang, fujian, israel, taiwan, california, england, shanghai, and guangdong.  taiwan and 7 of the 22 provincesâ  of the prc are represented in this list.  they tend to be the more populous provinces, though there are some provinces conspicuously missing from the list, like shandong and henan<p>guangdong: 126 million<p>jiangsu: 85 million<p>hebei: 75 million<p>zhejiang: 65 million<p>anhui: 61 million<p>hubei: 58 million<p>fujian: 41 million<p>shanghai (city): 25 million<p>beijing (city): 22 million<p>tianjin (city): 14 million<p>the total population of the above regions is 570 million<p>taiwan is another 24 million people, bringing the total to some 600 million.  so this is not quite half the population of china.  so while there is surely some &#x27;redlining&#x27; going on in china, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s against 98% or even 60% of the population<p>that is, probably nobody is going to start a company in inner mongolia making photolithography equipment for new chip fabs, but inner mongolia only has a population of 24 million people despite being 12% of china&#x27;s land area, bigger than france and spain together.  it has no ocean ports because it&#x27;s nowhere near an ocean.  it&#x27;s a long airplane flight away from where people are building the chip fabs, and you can&#x27;t fit a vacuum ultraviolet photolithography machine under your airline seat, or possibly on an airliner at all.  wuhai didn&#x27;t get its first airport until 02003.  so, though i obviously know very little, i don&#x27;t think even massive state investment to promote an electronics industry in chifeng would be successful<p>especially if we add california, israel, england, and ontario to the list, i think it&#x27;s clear that the computer industry today is far more geographically inclusive than it was 50 years ago<p>but it&#x27;s possible i&#x27;m just not understanding what you mean.  what metrics of geographic inclusivity would you suggest?<p>______<p>â  the prc also contains 5 &#x27;autonomous regions&#x27;, two &#x27;special administrative regions&#x27;

  Your naming isn&#x27;t right, although the story otherwise is accurate.

  The Jerq was the original name for the 68K machines hand-made by Bart. The
  name, originally coined for a fun demo of the Three Rivers Perq by folks at
  Lucasfilm, was borrowed with permission by us but was considered unsuitable
  by Sam Morgan as we reached out to make some industrially, by a company
  (something Atlantic) on Long Island. So &quot;Blit&quot; was coined. The Blit name
  later stuck unofficially to the DMD-5620, which was made by Teletype and,
  after some upheavals, had a Western Electric BellMac 32000 CPU.

  If 5620s were called Jerqs, it was an accident. All the software with that
  name would be for the original, Locanthi-built and -designed 68K machines.

  The sequence is thus Jerq, Blit, DMD-5620. DMD stood for dot-mapped rather
  than bit-mapped, but I never understood why. It seemed a category error to
  me.

  Lucasfilm to the Three Rivers PERQ workstations they had, for which the
  Pascal-written software and operating system were unsatisfactory. Bart
  Locanthi and I (with Greg Chesson and Dave Ditzel?) visited Lucasfilm in
  1981 and we saw all the potential there with none of the realization. My
  personal aha was that, as on the Alto, only one thing could be running at a
  time and that was a profound limitation. When we began to design our answer
  to these problems a few weeks later, we called Lucasfilm to ask if they
  minded us borrowing their excellent rude name, and they readily agreed.

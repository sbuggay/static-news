Of that period, the best known today is the Graham-Newman Partnership, founded by Benjamin Graham and his long-time business partner Jerry Newman. This was cited by Warren Buffett in a 2006 letter to the Museum of American Finance as an early hedge fund, and based on other comments from Buffett, Janet Tavakoli deems Graham&#x27;s investment firm the first hedge fund.</i><p><i>The sociologist Alfred W. Jones is credited with coining the phrase &quot;hedged fund&quot; and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in 1949.

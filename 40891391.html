I even ended up getting an ASQ Six Sigma Green Belt certification. My favorite thing to say to people when they asked what 5S stood for was &quot;Shove Stupid Shit Someplace Secret&quot;. In my experience, that wasn&#x27;t an entirely inaccurate interpretation.<p>Joking aside, I think this article does a decent job of translating Lean manufacturing principles to coding, but the &quot;Set in Order&quot; section grinds my gears a little bit. I have worked on many projects of various sizes, and I think my fellow web devs tend to lean too hard into an overly nested directory structure. In manufacturing terms, imagine if you needed to open a cabinet that contains a toolbox with a plastic organizer in one of the drawers that contains a box that you had to open to get access to some rivets. It doesn&#x27;t take much for that level of organization to kneecap efficiency. I would much rather have a single directory with 20 files than try to chase down a component file that&#x27;s eight directories deep. Give me a big list of long descriptive file names, not short names that rely on the directory name to give context.</div><br/><div id="40929191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40929191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">osigurdson</span><span>|</span><a href="#40928712">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40933587">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40929191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40929191">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem with relying on a tree is most brains don&#x27;t organize information like that.

The problem with folders is that in most interfaces you canât see their content until theyâre opened. In some really bad interfaces you can only see one open folder at a time.<p>Flat lists let you see the entire thing at once. As long as there is some sort of natural sort order, itâs still a âneatâ way to organise things.<p>E.g.:<p><pre><code>    SomeApp-PRD-Web
    SomeApp-PRD-DB
    OtherApp-PRD-Web
    OtherApp-PRD-DB
    OtherApp-PRD-API
</code></pre>
Is roughly how I organise cloud resources. You can instantly see that there are two apps, and that both are web+db but the second one also has an API.<p>If you had folders youâd just see this:<p><pre><code>    SomeApp
    OtherApp
</code></pre>
That just tells you that there are two apps, and nothing else. You have to navigate several times to get to the detail you could see at a glance with the flat structure.<p>Similar concepts apply to code at every level. I avoid overly abstract functions that do their job through seven levels of trivial abstractions for the same reason.

This leads to problems being dealt with in time and in context, instead of being ignored or concealed.  (Remind you of PG&#x27;s distinction between being persistent vs. obstinate?)  The difference lay not really in the major premise (the principles) but in how and when the minor premise of fault-correction was applied.<p>To me in software that&#x27;s all about scheduling: scheduling infrastructure work and cross-training early, doing post-mortem&#x27;s immediately, building design consensus iteratively with discussion and prototyping, etc.  Scheduling and objectivity: not who&#x27;s saying it, but what&#x27;s being said.  Both should empower IC&#x27;s by giving them actual time and actual say.<p>In particular, clean code is often not the best, but can empower those otherwise bereft of natural authority.  Sometimes duplication is better than dependencies, a little pile is better than a lot of structure, a complex PR is easier to review all at once, etc.<p>Empowering people makes selecting and orienting them quite important - but that&#x27;s a separate issue.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40932126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40932126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hahamrfunnyguy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40932151">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40934501">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40932126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40932126">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I worked for a manufacturing company that rolled out 5S.

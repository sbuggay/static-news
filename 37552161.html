He worked as an art dealer and traveled a lot when he was young.<p>Where it gets interesting is when he sets out to become an artist himself.  Over the course of only ten years he produced a staggering 900 paintings.  (I typically spend a few months on only one drawing.  And most of those don&#x27;t even have color.)<p>It&#x27;s not that I now like his work, but I sure have learned to appreciate the man and his mission.

It is the better van Gogh. Trust me on this.<p>The Kröller-Müller collection was made before van Gogh has broken through. They got first pick on everything. Although the van Gogh has more works, the Kröller-Müller has the better ones. Besides the setting of the Kröller-Müller is much much nicer.</div><br/><div id="37566558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37566558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">djmips</span><span>|</span><a href="#37566462">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37562125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37566558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37566558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not an either or situation.

Paul Gauguin was an expert swordsman who carried a particular sword with him at all times.  He and Vincent would have terrible fights when they lived together in Arles.  We know that Paul was scheduled to move away the next day and that night they had a big fight and that Paul left town immediately in a rush leaving his sword behind.

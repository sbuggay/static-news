They are an important new capability and one that will change how we do certain tasks.<p>But as to the hype, we are in a brief pause before the election where no company wants to release anything that would hit the news cycle in a bad way and cause knee-jerk legislation. Are there new architectures and capabilities waiting? Likely some. Sora showed state of the art video generation, OpenAI has demoed an impressive voice mode, and Anthropic has teased that Opus 3.5 will be even more capable. OpenAI also clearly has some gas in the tank as they have focused on releasing small models such as GPT-4o and 4o mini. And many have been musing about agents and methods to improve system 2 like reasoning.<p>So while there’s a soft moratorium on showing scary new capability there is still evidence of progress being made behind-the-scenes. But what will a state of the art model look like when all of these techniques have been scaled up on brand new exascale data centers?<p>It might not be AGI, but I think it will at least be enough for the next hype Investment bubble.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41307203" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41307203" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aussieguy1234</span><span>|</span><a href="#41308241">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41304419">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41307203">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41307203">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If anything, i&#x27;m getting more hyped up over time.

There are about 1000 tutorials on this that are almost certainly in GPT-4&#x27;s training data. I gave GPT two small twists so it&#x27;s not a simple case of copy&#x2F;paste: I asked it 1) to apply a texture to the triangle and 2) to keep all the code in a single function. (Most tutorials break the code up into about a dozen functions, but each of these functions are called only once, so it should be trivial to inline them.)<p>Within the first ten lines, the code is already completely nonfunctional:<p>GPT-4o declares a pointer (VkPhysicalDevice) that is uninitialized. It queries the number of graphics devices on the host machine. A human being would allocate a buffer with that number of elements and store the reference in the pointer. GPT-4o just ignores the result. Completely ignores it. So the function call was just for fun, I guess? It then tries to copy an entire array of VkPhysicalDevice_T objects into this uninitialized pointer.

These are not (all) trivial either; there is a very niche (for banking) key&#x2F;value store written in Go for instance which has a lot of edge cases etc, all the plumbing (x,err = etc aka stuff people find annoying) comes from sonnet and works one-shot. A lot of business logic comes from sonnet too; it works but usually needs a little tweaking to make it correct.<p>Tests are all done by Sonnet. I think 80% is low balling it on Go code really.<p>We have a lot of complex code generator stuff and DSLs in TS which also works well often. Sometimes it gets some edge cases wrong, but either re-prompting with more details or fixing it ourselves, will do it. At a fraction of the time&#x2F;money of what a fully human team would deliver.<p>I wrote a 3d editor for fun with Sonnet in a day.<p>I have terrible results with gpt&#x2F;copilot (copilot is good for editing instead of complete files&#x2F;functions; chatgpt is not good much compared with sonnet); it doesn&#x27;t get close at all; it simply keeps giving me the same code over and over again when I say it&#x27;s wrong; it hardcodes things specifically asked to make flexible etc. Not sure why the difference is so massive all of sudden.<p>Note: I use the sonnet API, not the web interface, but same for gpt so...</div><br/><div id="41308073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41308073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rcarmo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41304419">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41306969">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41304941">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41308073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41308073">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d like to see that 3D editor.

I&#x27;ve worked in machine learning and built products for over 20 years and now use AI a fair bit in the ed-tech work we do.<p>So I&#x27;ve seen how the field has progressed and also have been able to look at it from a perspective most AI&#x2F;engineering people don&#x27;t -- what does this artificial intelligence look like when compared to biological intelligence. And I must say I am absolutely astonished people don&#x27;t see this as opening the flood-gates to staggeringly powerful artificial intelligence. We&#x27;ve run the 4-minute mile. There are hundreds of billions of dollars figuring out how to get to the next level, and it&#x27;s clear we are close. Forget what the current models are doing, it is what the next big leap (most likely with some new architecture change) will bring.<p>In focusing on intelligence we forget that it&#x27;s most likely a much easier challenge than decentralized cheap autonomy, which is what took the planet 4 billion years to figure out. Once that was done, intelligence as we recognize it took an eye-blink. Just like with powered-flight we don&#x27;t need bioliogical intelligence to transform the world. Artificial intelligence that guzzles electricity, is brittle, has blind spots, but still capable of 1000 times more than the best among us is going to be here within the next decade. It&#x27;s not here yet, no doubt, but I am yet to see any reasoned argument for why it is far more difficult and will take far longer.

Here&#x27;s a quick breakdown:<p>1. content: Nope, except for barrel-bottom content sludge of the kind formerly done by third world spam spinning companies, most decent content creation stays well away from AI except for generating basic content layout templates. I work as a writer and even now, most companies stay well away from using GPT et al for anything they want to be respected as content. Please..<p>2. Customer service: You&#x27;ve just written a string of PR corporate-speak AI seller bullshit that barely corresponds to reality. People WANT to speak to humans, and except for very basic inquiries, they feel insulted if they&#x27;re forced into interaction with some idiotic stochastic parrot of an AI for any serious customer support problems. Just imagine some guy trying to handle a major problem with his family&#x27;s insurance claim or urgently access money that&#x27;s been frozen in his bank account, and then forced to do these things via the half-baked bullshit funnel that is an AI. If you run a company that forces that upon me for anything serious in customer service, I would get you the fuck out of my life and recommend any friend willing to listen does the same.<p>3.

So what&#x27;s better than obfuscating that fact by having 100+ acronyms? It&#x27;s a nice cover and apparently there are still investors who are buying it. I get it, we have to learn to say the right things to get funding.<p>&gt; <i>Where we are really going to see the bloom of AI is in goal directed systems, and I think those will come naturally with robotics.</i><p>I agree. Physical feedback is needed if we want an electronic entity to &quot;evolve&quot; similarly to us.<p>&gt; <i>I predict we are in for a very abrupt 2nd industrial revolution, and you and I will be able to have this discussion either over a 55 gallon barrel of burning trash, or in our robot manicured botanical gardens sometime in the near future lol.</i><p>I agree this is 100% inevitable but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coming as soon as you say. The LLMs are hopelessly stuck even today and the whole AI area will suffer for it for a while after the bubble bursts... which is the event that I am certain is coming soon.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41305505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41305505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">petra</span><span>|</span><a href="#41296861">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41299496">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41299566">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41300646">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41305505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41305505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll use LLM&#x27;s for customer service.<p>But it&#x27;s a building block.

What do you see that&#x27;s missing still, if anything?<p>If I had to bet, I would start with:<p>- Error-correcting specialized architectures for increasing signal-to-noise (as far as I can tell these are what everyone is racing to build this year, and should be doable with just conventional programming systems wrapping LLMs)<p>- Improved energy efficiency (as yes, human brains are currently much more efficient!  But - there are also simple architecture improvements (both software and hardware) that are looking to save 100x.  Specialized ASIC ternary chips using 1999&#x27;s tech should be here quite soon, a lot more efficient in price and energy.)<p>- No Backwards-propagation.  (As yes, the brain does seem to do it all with forward-propagation only.  Though this is possible and promising in neural networks like the Forward-Forward algorithm too, they haven&#x27;t been trained to the same scales as backprop-heavy transformers (and likely have a lower performance in terms of noise&#x2F;accuracy).  Though if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the brain does have forward-backward loops, but the signals go through separate neurons for each direction (rather than reusing one) - if so that&#x27;s close to backprop by itself, but probably imposes a tradeoff as the same signal can&#x27;t be perfectly reproduced backwards, yet it can perhaps be enhanced to be just the most relevant information by the separate specialized neuron.   I&#x27;m obviously mostly ignorant of the neuroscience here but halfway-knowledgeable on the ML theory haha<p>But yes, I completely agree - the flood gates are already open.  This is a few architecture quibbles away from an absolute deluge of artificial intelligence that will dwarf (drown?) anything we&#x27;ve known.  Good point on decentralized cheap autonomy - the real accomplishment of life.  Intelligence, as it appears, is just a fairly generous phenomenon where any autonomous process continually improves its signal-to-noise ratio...  many ways to accomplish that one!

This is a great achievement in of itself, think how much this will make up in a company as large as MS or Google.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41307170" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41307170" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antupis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41307051">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41307293">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41305999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41307170">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41307170">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; As everything, now AI is losing hype, but somehow (in my bubble) seems like engineers are still high on it.

They are spending money on poorly thought-out ideas.<p>Meanwhile, every tech company providing &quot;AI services&quot; has been spending money like a drunken sailor, fueled by hype and FOMO. None of these AI services are generating enough revenue to cover the cost of development, training, or even, in many cases, inference.<p>Nvidia, the dominant software-plus-hardware platform (CUDA is a big deal), appears to be the only financial beneficiary of all this hype and FOMO.<p>According to the OP, the business of &quot;AI&quot; is losing hype, suggesting we&#x27;re approaching a bust.</div><br/><div id="41307814" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41307814" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dogcomplex</span><span>|</span><a href="#41298808">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41301820">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41307814">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41307814">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Investors need to stop looking at AI as a path to profits, and more as an enormous risk to the profitability of every other business.  If AGI gets hit, it&#x27;s probably not going to stay monopolized for long, nor is it going to be market neutral.  Every business is going to need an AI infusion to compete, which many will get, cutting costs and raising efficiencies of each business in an ongoing competitive spiral to the bottom line - which... will be eventually measured in just: robotic labor, energy, and compute.  The profit margins on all those businesses shrink to nothing as they become basically utilities.  The net effect?  Possibly a massive deflation, and &quot;crashing&quot; of the stock market, even as the total utility and value of the system skyrockets.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bull bet, it&#x27;s a bear.   AI would need to be perfectly monopolized to capture all the gains, and it&#x27;s increasingly looking like that won&#x27;t be the case - as all the component pieces are already open source at competitive levels, and any final architecture improvements that cross the final thresholds could be leaked in a 50GB file.  Whoever gets to it first has a few months head start, at most, and probably not enough time or control to sell products - or shovels.  After that it&#x27;s a neverending race to zero, to the benefit of the consumer and the detriment of the investor.<p>Nvidia is a great example case.  They currently dominate the GPU market, an &quot;essential hardware for AI&quot;, yet ternary asic chips specialized for transformer-only architectures are looking quite viable at 1999s tech levels.

Recently I needed to add a summary section to the introduction of a large number of articles. So, I copied the article into ChatGPT and told it to summarize the piece into 3-4 bullet points. Were I doing this task a few years ago, I would have read each article and then written the bullet points myself – nothing particularly difficult, but very time-consuming to do for dozens of articles. Instead, I used ChatGPT and saved myself hours upon hours of mundane work.<p>This is a quite minor and mundane example, but you can (hopefully) see how this will have major effects on any kind of routine text-creation.<p>2. I am working on a side project which requires the creation of a large number of custom images. I&#x27;ve had this project idea for a few years, but previously couldn&#x27;t afford to spend $20k hiring an illustrator to make them all. Now with Midjourney, I am able to create essentially unlimited images for $30-100 a month. This new AI tool has quite literally unlocked a new business idea that was previously inaccessible.</div><br/><div id="41298295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41298295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pdimitar</span><span>|</span><a href="#41296827">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41298252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41297125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41298295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41298295">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Responding emotionally by using words like &quot;ignorance&quot; and &quot;laziness&quot; undermines any argument that you might think you are making.<p>Have you considered that you getting almost angry at somebody &quot;not seeing the light&quot; means you might hold preconceived notions that might not hold to reality? You would not be practicing critical thinking if you are not willing to question your assumptions.<p>It seems your assumption is very standard: &quot;revolution is just around the corner, how can you not see it?&quot;.<p>OK, let the revolution come and I&#x27;ll apologize to you personally. Ping me when it happens. For real. But make sure it&#x27;s an actual revolution and not &quot;OMFG next Midjourney can produce moon-scapes!&quot;, okay?<p>---<p>RE: 1, cool, I heard such success stories and I like them. But I also heard about executives flunking contracts because they over-relied on ChatGPT to summarize &#x2F; synthesize contract items. I am glad it&#x27;s making progress but people are being people and they will rely on a 100% fault-free AI. If that&#x27;s not in place yet then the usefulness drops sharply because double-checking is even more time-consuming than doing the thing by yourself in the first place.<p>RE: 2, your side projects are not representative of anything at all. And I for one recognize AI images from a mile away and steer clear of projects that make use of them.

Sometimes, the obvious must be studied so it can be asserted with full confidence:
- LLMs can not answer questions whose answers are not in their training set in some form, 
- they can not solve problems they haven&#x27;t been trained on, 
- they can not acquire new skills our knowledge without lots of human help,
- they can not invent new things.
Now, LLMs are merely a subset of AI techniques.

- Companies may find it hard to improve profits using AI in the short term
- A crash may come
- We may be close to AGI
- Current models are flawed in many ways
- Current level generative AI is good enough to serve many use cases<p>Reality is nobody truly knows - there&#x27;s disagreement on these questions among the leaders in the field.<p>An observation to add to the mix:<p>I&#x27;ve had to deliberately work full time with LLM&#x27;s in all kinds of contexts since they were released. That means forcing myself to use them for tasks whether they are &quot;good at them&quot; yet or not. I found that a major inhibitor to my adoption was my own set of habits around how I think and do things. We aren&#x27;t used to offloading certain cognitive &#x2F; creative tasks to machines. We still have the muscle memory of wanting to grab the map when we&#x27;ve got GPS in front of us. I found that once I pushed through this barrier and formed new habits it became second nature to create custom agents for all kinds of purposes to help me in my life. One learns what tasks to offload to the AI and how to offload them - and when and how one needs to step in to pair the different capabilities of the human mind.<p>I personally feel that pushing oneself to be an early adopter holds real benefit.</div><br/><div id="41297324" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41297324" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jackhab</span><span>|</span><a href="#41297298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41296743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41297324">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41297324">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you give some examples of the tasks you did manage to offload successfully?</div><br/><div id="41297726" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41297726" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">castigatio</span><span>|</span><a href="#41297298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41297324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41296743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41297726">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41297726">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">- Emotional regulation. I suffer from a mostly manageable anxiety disorder but there are times I get overwhelmed. I have an agent setup to focus on principles of Stoicism and its amazing how quickly I can get back on track just by having a short chat with it about how I&#x27;m feeling.<p>- Personalised learning. I wanted to understand LLM&#x27;s at foundational technical level. Often I&#x27;ll understand 90% of an explanation but there&#x27;s a small part that I don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot;. Being able to deliberately target that 10% and be able to slowly increase the complexity of the explanation (starting from explain like I&#x27;m 5) is something I can&#x27;t do with other learning material.<p>- Investing. I&#x27;m a very casual investor. But I keep a running conversation with an agent about my portfolio. Obviously I&#x27;m not asking it to tell me what to invest in but just asking questions about what it thinks of my portfolio has taught me  about risk balancing techniques I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise thought about.<p>- Personal profile management. Like most of us I have public facing touch points - social media, blog, github, CV etc. I find it helpful to have an agent that just helps me with my thought process around content I might want to create or just what my strategy is around posting. It&#x27;s not at all about asking the thing to generate content - it&#x27;s about using it to reflect at a meta level on what I&#x27;m thinking and doing - which stimulates my own thinking.<p>- Language learning - I have a language teaching agent to help me learn a language I&#x27;m trying to master. I can converse with it, adapt it to whatever learning style works best for me etc. The voice feature works well with this.<p>- And just in general - when I have some thinking task I want to do now - like I need to plan a project or set a strategy I&#x27;ll use an LLM as a thought partner. The context window is large enough to accomodate a lot of history - and it just augments my own mind - gives me better memory, can point out holes in my thinking etc.<p>__<p>Edit: actually now that I have written out a response to your question I realise It&#x27;s not so much offloading tasks in a wholesale way - its more augmenting my own thinking and learning - but this does reduce the burden on me to &quot;think about&quot; a range of things like where to get information or to come up with multiple examples of something or to think through different scenarios.</div><br/><div id="41306446" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41306446" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abrichr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41297298">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41297726">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41296743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41306446">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41306446">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I have an agent setup to focus on principles of Stoicism and its amazing how quickly I can get back on track just by having a short chat with it about how I&#x27;m feeling.<p>This sounds super useful.

He provides advice on job search strategies, resume writing, interview preparation, and networking. He helps set goals, offers motivational support, and keeps track of application progress, all while incorporating principles of Stoicism such as resilience, discipline, and mindfulness. He emphasizes emotional support and practical encouragement, helping you act deliberately each day to increase your chances of landing the job you want. He assists in building networks, reaching out to people, using existing networks, sharpening your professional profile, applying for jobs, developing skills, and dealing with disappointments, anxieties, and fears. He offers strategies to manage anxiety, self-recrimination, and mental rumination over the past. His communication is casual, easy-going, supportive, yet strong and clear, providing constructive suggestions and critiques. He listens carefully, avoids repeating advice, responds with necessary information, and avoids being long-winded. To prevent overwhelming users, he focuses on providing the most pertinent and actionable suggestions, limiting the number of recommendations in each response. Marcus Aurelius also pays close attention to signs of despair during the job hunt. He helps balance emotions, offers specific strategies to keep motivated, and provides consistent encouragement to keep going, ensuring that you don&#x27;t get overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy or the fear of never finding a suitable job.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41296743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41296743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gorgoiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#41297298">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41296743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41296743">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Asking an API to write three paragraphs of text still takes tens of seconds and requires working internet and an expensive data center.<p>Meanwhile we’re seeing the first of the new generation of on-device inference chips being shipped as commodity edge compute.<p>When the devices you use every day — cars, doorbells, TV remotes, points-of-sale, roombas — can interpret camera and speech input locally in the time it takes to draw a frame and with low enough power to still give you 10h between charges: then we’ll be due another round of innovation.<p>The article points to how few parts of the economy are leveraging the text-only API products currently available.

People who are really into staying up all night dancing to techno music aren&#x27;t buying expensive alcoholic drinks, they&#x27;re buying cheap water to stay hydrated. Many (though by no means all) take drugs, but generally that means one dose of a drug like MDMA at the beginning of the evening. Psychedelic drugs like LSD are also associated with the rave scene but are less compatible with a nightclub environment (bars, security, overgrown disco lights). People are more likely to consume psychedelics at an outdoor party or a warehouse space.<p>In my view what has killed raves was the declining availability of cheap accessible commercial spaces, police&#x2F;administrative hostility to informal economic activity, and overcommercialization, which has tended to select for the shittiest music&#x2F;DJs.</div><br/><div id="42643035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42643035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">secretsatan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42642181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42643035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42643035">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there is some overlap, there are some nightclubs that are much more orientated to the cheap scene, I know if I walk into a club with large areas dedicated to bottle service tables, I&#x27;m not going to have a fun time and the people will be much more obnoxious.<p>But there&#x27;s some excellent venues here in Switzerland, and I think many are helped with arts funding and&#x2F;or run as artist collectives and non profits.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42642181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42642181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HellDunkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42643035">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42643046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42642181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42642181">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you are missing something.

This was after gradually requiring EMTs and increased security at events after Allen Ho died in 1999.  There was a huge protest at city hall, but that had no impact on the course of things.  Combined with the recession and then SARS in 2003, people effectively stopped going out to larger events, although people getting older with more obligations was certainly a contributing factor as well.

Raves are where people rave!<p>While true, I think in this case it is referring to the noun, which peaked in the 90s early 2000s underground movement and was the basis for the PLUR culture that is uniquely absent in the club scene; and I say that as a person who has mainly been into clubs as I was too young at the time but knew plenty of those candy-ravers growing up but was really into various genres of psy music (ambient then, techno and then finally  trance) before I ever went out to party.<p>I read the article, and it&#x27;s maonly focused on techno heavy parts of Berlin and OZ but I know there is a contingent of early dubstepers and to a lesser extend DnB (which was more widely accepted at the time) here on HN that grew up and went to events that were analogous to this as we listened to pirate radio from the UK and went to underground parties out in warehouses and in outdoor parties when things were only starting up because we couldn&#x27;t go to Plastic People in London.<p>This is the closest we had to the early rave scene, where everyone sort of knew everyone (including the artists, promoters or venue owners) and we still called it &#x27;raving&#x27; as you mentioned, but these became the state-side analogues (Dub-Warz [0] in EC and SMOG [1] in WC) to DMZ [2] nights and eventually to things like Red Bull Academy sponsored events and Outlook festival [3] [4] when adoption had peaked.<p>All of this is to say, that the verb and the noun represent unique periods, that latter I think can still be found in festivals but have ultimately a more corporate and capitalistic motivation than just a bunch of party people bootstrapping and renting a bunch of generators and PAs and taking them out into a warehouse, desert or forest and dancing all night and day.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aP9ve9YEjGY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aP9ve9YEjGY</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=T150ZZZ0Luo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=T150ZZZ0Luo</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TziN0N40X3E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TziN0N40X3E</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MbRb2Ds9s58" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MbRb2Ds9s58</a><p>4: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tXNSbjhREDY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tXNSbjhREDY</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42635227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42635227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kstrauser</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640425">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42634701">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42635227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42635227">[46 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One big change is that they got better and much more organized.

I lived next to the beach for most of my teens, we had two night clubs, none of them remain, the next town has one that still remains but another one that closed in the early 2000s not to open again, a major electronic music came in its place, incidentally cancelled last year for financial fraud raisons.
Where I live today, I saw one night club close, I think in 2019 (before covid) but I didn&#x27;t see one open. In fact, I don&#x27;t remember seeing a night club open since the early 2000s.

I teach DJing (house&#x2F;techno mostly) and there&#x27;s never been more interest in electronic music &amp; DJing. Folks who thought I was a bit out there in high school for liking electronic &amp; dance music, have recently all now become more interested in DJing and raving. The DJ today is continuing to grow into the modern rock-star (albeit, in terms of real $ of music money, it&#x27;s no where close).<p>Moreover, as several commenters have pointed out there has been a big growth in festivals and awareness. Lots of people talk to me about &quot;house music&quot; now, whereas before it was a relatively &quot;underground&quot; thing.<p>Now, I think there&#x27;s a question about whether the scale of such events have maintained the same cultural ethos as the early rave days, and that, though I&#x27;m not old enough to have participated, is likely a categorical no. There&#x27;s a greater focus on &#x27;documenting&#x27; experiences at these events rather than living it. Here&#x27;s a clip of an rising group called Kienemusik [tik tok link](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@as.anca&#x2F;video&#x2F;7359750430345186593?q=kienemusik%20party&amp;t=1736373152323" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;@as.anca&#x2F;video&#x2F;7359750430345186593?q=...</a>), where you can see there&#x27;s more video taping than dancing.

I DJ&#x27;d a couple raves back then but it was something that any of my friends were into so I naturally fell out of it even though I loved it so much. I later got back into it briefly and made a few house and trance tracks when computer DAWs became popular.<p>There was a sense of freedom and optimism on the dance floor that I&#x27;ve never found anywhere else. I made songs like the songs that I most liked to dance to. Most of it came from Europe back then, but I wish I followed my heart, or at least spent half my time following my heart.<p>I feel bad for the kids in the video. In my day, and maybe yours, it would have been very unusual to see a cellphone in the club or at a rave. My kids schools don&#x27;t allow screens and they go away for a couple weeks each summer to a camp that doesn&#x27;t allow screens. They tell me that they really enjoy it after a couple of days, and I think it gives them a chance to feel the way we did as kids... back then there wasn&#x27;t a movement of people trying to live more in the moment because everybody lived in the moment all the time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42639975" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42639975" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vips7L</span><span>|</span><a href="#42638869">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42639163">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42635224">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42639975">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42639975">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Phoneless events are out there.

In the big city if you don&#x27;t make it into the big leagues, only the dregs are left. Cities amplify the extremes. In rural areas, the $30 per hour jobs are willing to hire any warm body that shows up.<p>Of course, rural is a difficult categorization as it is a catchall for everything that is left. A rural area with a strong agricultural sector, for example, is nothing like a rural area that is not much more than barren wilderness.

I&#x27;m a nerd&#x27;s nerd, one of my fondest memories is staying up all night alone in my room playing with threads and sockets in Java as a teen. I&#x27;ve had 3 romantic partners, 1 asked me out, 2 I met on a dating site. I do not approach people in real life. I barely live in real life.<p>This feeling that I&#x27;m missing out on something and unsure if I want it, peaked earlier this year when I dated a girl who was just a hundred times cooler than me. A chill go-with-the-flow hippie literal surfer type. When I think about her I have to wonder what the fuck is wrong with me.

However, given the right style, music, AND a few (or possibly many) months of deliberate practice to make it &quot;click&quot; in your brain, many people could move from category (b) to (a). Searching through this parameter space requires time and effort. This is a thread about EDM, and I spent some time trying to like EDM because it was cool, until I realized that it&#x27;s not for me, and I have zero inclination to dance to it unless I&#x27;m on MDMA. On the other hand, swing, salsa, bachata ended up being absolutely my jam -- after months of deliberate practice, as none of these musical styles were super familiar to me at the outset.<p>For a lot folks, partnered dance forms are nothing short of life changing, and they tend to appeal to analytical introverts; if you haven&#x27;t tried already, go sign up for your local lindy hop lessons, and keep your expectations low.

This had the effect of pushing the prices up, changing the scene and crowd, and introducing more regulations.

When I got into the scene (late 90s, Philly and Baltimore), everyone legit totally avoided saying &quot;rave&quot; or &quot;raving&quot; when talking with other folks in the scene. We all just said &quot;party&quot;, and it was clear what you were talking about based on context (and, for better or worse, clothing style). No one said &quot;ravers&quot; either, it was always &quot;party kids&quot; instead, at least among the younger end of the crowd.<p>&quot;Party&quot; could interchangeably refer to either a &quot;one-off&quot; event or a club weekly&#x2F;monthly, and similarly made no connotations as to whether or not the venue was licensed&#x2F;above-board. Unlicensed one-offs were referred to as &quot;outlaw&quot;, &quot;warehouse party&quot;, etc. There were also unlicensed venues which threw regular weekly&#x2F;monthly parties and these were absolutely amazing, so I&#x27;m a bit perplexed by the folks here saying a &quot;real&quot; rave is only an unlicensed one-off.<p>In any case, in my area, as a term &quot;rave&quot; was largely only used by news media, law enforcement, and outsiders who completely misunderstood what the scene was about. The only major exception was internet discussions – web sites like ravelinks.com, newsgroups like alt.rave. But even there, &quot;rave&quot; in the name just helped people find the sites, and still wasn&#x27;t a term thrown around much in actual discussions.<p>&gt; Has the music droppped off?<p>No, it&#x27;s better than ever in my opinion, especially for non-mainstream house-adjacent music.  There are a ton of talented producers who are seamlessly merging many genres and influences... folks are combining classic UK rave synths (well, really from Belgian New Beat originally) with Italo-disco, or taking trance and adding in happy hardcore elements, etc. Many classic samples and sounds, but given a new twist, it&#x27;s great.<p>That said, I used to be a major drum and bass head back in the day, but largely lost interest in that genre as it became less danceable over the years.

There was nothing they needed to find or be in the know about, and to them, the festivals are that same journey.<p>Regarding expense: not everyone is broke. And many people have shifted their budget to exclusively going to music festivals. I know lots of people that scoff at the idea of going to a nightclub or “going out” at all, but praise and prioritize going to music festivals. Even more are on payment plans for festival tickets far in advance, they are confident they can sell them at a premium if they don&#x27;t go.<p>I’m just reporting what I’m seeing and applying market dynamics to it.<p>Given the tension with “wooks” that bum their way to the bigger festivals and have little to support themselves or any integration into society, I see intentional segregation with the current generation of festivals goers that supports an intentional interest in paying a premium for the exclusion it comes with. Event groups found that pool of wealth and demand, and are capitalizing on it to its extreme.

I’m not pointing out anything new, but I do think a lot of people don’t see it because it’s hidden behind a facade of very visible socially liberal movements that garner attention out of proportion to their numbers. These folks do not represent the mean or the median of the culture.<p>If you are in the Bay Area or LA or really any metro California city that isn’t a deep suburb your experience might be different. These areas have always been more liberal than the average and enduringly so. The SF Bay was where gay people could go back when there was not just a strong taboo but in many cases real persecution.<p>Edit: with the last election I think the conservative zeitgeist is going to finally crest, and probably inspire a backlash that will start the pendulum going the other way. Things like politics are the lagging end. There’s also a backlash brewing against social media including dating apps, which are one of the drivers for both youth alienation and promulgation of reactionary attitudes.

The rave scene around Berlin is quite alright, but we learned to protect our safe spaces, and many will not mention details online anymore.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42637148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42637148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Spivak</span><span>|</span><a href="#42636668">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42637215">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42637148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42637148">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn&#x27;t use Burning Man as a metric for the scene overall because among ravers Burning Man is considered to be one of the worst festivals.</div><br/><div id="42637243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42637243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quchen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42636668">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42637148">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42637243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42637243">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How so?

There’s a smattering of respected DJs&#x2F;producers each year and some good sets, but otherwise there’s a bunch of art cars roaming around thumping generic party music. Absolutely nothing against Donna summers, but I’m not shitting you when I say I heard her around a half a dozen times the first big party night, for instance. There is no curation there like a music festival.<p>That said, absolutely worth going to at least once, for everything else.</div><br/><div id="42638893" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42638893" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quchen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42636668">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42637547">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42638893">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42638893">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are a couple of smaller burns here I have connections to, I like the participatory idea, as opposed to pure consumption like a holiday park.

You might be one of the worst players in your local cardroom, so your only winning move is not to play. Or you might be one of the best, but you don&#x27;t travel to other games, so you win in spite of your self. I&#x27;ve seen so many people like this!

Isaac Haxton is a top pro player who only plays only tournaments that cost $10k+ to buyin to, and recently discussed how this works on a recent episode of the Thinking Poker podcast by Andrew Brokos. He actually recommends against tournaments for less experienced players aiming to make money since smaller buyin tournaments have large fields and thus large variance, but the &quot;high roller&quot; tournaments have smaller fields which make variance more reasonable.<p>The bigger point is that while playing against worse players is an important skill if you want to make money, poker is still a very complex game with a high skill ceiling similar to a game like chess. If you&#x27;re good enough, even pro players are &quot;worse players&quot; and you can &quot;select&quot; those games. Though admittedly even the high roller tournaments require some &quot;recreational&quot; businessman players for enough pros to be willing to play it for it to run.<p>Solver study has become essential for the vast majority of top pros, which Haxton also discusses in the podcast, and I mentioned my project in the space in my other comment.</div><br/><div id="39463756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39463756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cortesoft</span><span>|</span><a href="#39459891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39463055">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39463756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39463756">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For people actually trying to make a living playing poker, it isn’t enough just to find a game you can win; the game also has to return enough per hour to make it worth your while.

Poker has very high variance, and you can easily have 3 hours of hand shuffled poker and not get a single playable hand. That was when I realized I didn’t have the emotional regulation to play properly, especially, since part of the exercise was to throw away the strongest starting hand even if you are dealt it during this exercise. Also, that was about the time I realized that poker is generally an extremely boring game, with the very occassional periods of high emotion.<p>It did teach me a lot about going on tilt though, it’s very easy to throw away a lot of profit after a big loss.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39461870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39461870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qup</span><span>|</span><a href="#39459891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39459921">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39459980">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39459961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39461870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39461870">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you mean at the live casino, for low stakes (2&#x2F;5 or lower), you only need one tip: find a starting hand chart from any strategy site, book, platform, whatever.

I took a quick look at some of the materials and I would say that they&#x27;re pretty outdated as far as current understanding of the game goes. It&#x27;s more in line with how people talked about &amp; thought about the game in the boom era (the 00s) or possibly even earlier, to be honest.<p>If I were teaching poker in a university setting I would generally work with a bunch of toy games to teach concepts of polarization, MDF, indifference, and so on. Those are the fundamentals of poker theory in the modern environment.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a concrete example. In lecture five at 15m he starts talking about donk betting, which is when you lead out with a bet on a street into the aggressor from the previous street instead of checking to them to let them bet (for example, you&#x27;re the big blind, you call a raise from the button preflop, and then when the flop comes you bet directly yourself instead of checking). He mentions that this is unusual, which is true, because normally you would just check and let the person with the betting lead bet into you if you have a good hand, and so the donk bet is typically weak--but then he goes on to say that advanced players may exploit this perception by donk betting with a strong hand knowing you will interpret it as weak, and then you can exploit <i>that</i> line of thinking, etc.<p>A more modern view of donk betting is this: the &quot;betting lead&quot; is not anything inherent to the game but just an artifact of the range of hands each person has. Typically when you call preflop from the big blind, you&#x27;ll have a wider range of hands than the person raising preflop, because they can&#x27;t raise too wide profitably due to players left to act after them, and you get to both close the action &amp; also get better pot odds on your call from the big blind. Not only do you have a wider range of hands, then, but you also lack the strongest hands (AA, KK etc) because you would have reraised (3bet) them preflop. So overall, on most flops, the preflop raiser will have a stronger range of hands and can thus be expected to &quot;take the lead&quot; betting.<p>But! There are some flops that can neutralize or even reverse this range advantage. The flop 654 rainbow is now <i>better</i> for the big blind than for an early position (EP) raiser, because the big blind will have many straights, sets, two pairs, and pair+draw hands in their range, while the EP player will generally not have these hands. The EP&#x27;s big pairs (AA, KK etc) are less strong, and some of their other strong hands preflop like AK or AQs have totally whiffed too.<p>As a consequence, it is <i>correct</i> for the big blind to have a donk betting strategy in this situation--the way the two ranges interact, the big blind is now incentivized to put money into the pot directly, and in fact, if the big blind does not have a donk betting strategy on this flop, the EP player should respond by virtually never betting themselves. The big blind is incentivized to bet frequently with a small sizing and put pressure on EP&#x27;s overcards; if you have, say, 86s, and you can get a hand like QJo to fold, that&#x27;s a pretty decent result on the flop, because QJo has six outs to improve to a better pair.<p>Anyway, sorry that this example was probably hard to follow if you don&#x27;t play poker, but it&#x27;s probably illustrative of some of the ways in which poker theory has evolved over the years--more focus on the specifics of range vs range interactions. There are many more complicated and intricate examples on turns and rivers that solvers are very good at finding but may or may not be obvious to humans.<p>source: semi-professional online cash game player</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39460328" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39460328" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">antisthenes</span><span>|</span><a href="#39459891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39464287">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39459911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39460328">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39460328">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With a big caveat that GTO is only an optimal strategy against other players who are trying to play optimally.<p>If you have a table full of clowns who are playing a range of strategies (ranging from being spiteful to just all-ining every hand, to barely knowing how to play poker), you will very quickly go broke with GTO, because you didn&#x27;t adjust.</div><br/><div id="39460416" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39460416" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">highfrequency</span><span>|</span><a href="#39459891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39460328">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461526">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39460416">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39460416">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is wrong.

Nash equillibriums in general, and especially in poker, can be exploited in situations where one player is playing a negative EV strategy which happens at loose games. Morton&#x27;s theorem can be used to derive examples where a player playing optimally under the assumption that all players are acting independently loses out to another player playing suboptimally under that same assumption due to the presense of yet a third player playing a negative EV strategy. These kinds of scenarios are known as implicit collusion, basically the two players who are implicitly colluding together have an advantage over the single player who is making optimal decisions.<p>Ignoring the fact that there is no known GTO solution for more than 2 players, GTO only applies under the assumption that everyone is acting independently for some fairly formal and strict notion of independence. This requirement is broken in many real world games with more than 2 players potentially playing loose and wild, where they may not actually be colluding or coordinating with one another, but they behave as if they were.</div><br/><div id="39461681" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39461681" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilc</span><span>|</span><a href="#39459891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461137">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39461681">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39461681">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was playing I called this the &quot;School of Fish&quot; phenomenon.<p>If there are weak players they can effectively end up colluding against a stronger player who is playing &quot;More Optimally&quot;.<p>Understanding the table, is a key skill.

You can have a Nash equilibrium and also implicit collusion, for example if one player is playing GTO, that is they are playing optimally under the assumption that all other players are acting independently, and two other players are implicitly colluding with one another, you can still have a Nash equilibrium so that none of the players stand to gain anything by changing their strategy, and also the player playing GTO will have a negative expected value.<p>Imagine a situation where the collusion was explicit, you are playing GTO against two opponents who are colluding with one another. A Nash equilibrium will still exist in that situation but your EV will be negative. Now explicit collusion is considered cheating but you can imagine a scenario where two players play in such a way that even though they are not explicitly colluding with one another, they behave the exact same way as if they were. This happens among a group of loose players where their actions as a group rewards the group as a whole against players who are acting independently.<p>In other words, just because a strategy is optimal does not mean that it results in a positive expectation.

Certainly some people have great instincts for the game, but it&#x27;s just untrue that solvers can&#x27;t help you exploit weaker players. For example, if you&#x27;re on a given board and a given river and an opponent makes a big bet, if your opponent bluffs too much you should call, if they don&#x27;t bluff enough you should fold. But the solver teaches you how often they should be bluffing and thus what &quot;too much&quot; or &quot;not enough&quot; even means.<p>This is why I prefer the term &quot;theory-based&quot; to GTO, since the point of studying GTO is not to play GTO but to develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanics of the game.</div><br/><div id="39463619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39463619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qup</span><span>|</span><a href="#39459891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39463163">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39459981">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39463619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39463619">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Before solvers people still implemented strategies, so I&#x27;m not sure what you mean when you ask what my exploitation is based on.<p>I think GTO is a great way to think about the game.

My intuition having played recreationally is that the absolute optimal move in poker is relatively trivial to calculate compared to chess&#x2F;go. That is to say, most experienced players would reach this threshold without too much training. 
Obviously, what makes poker fun&#x2F;interesting is that you are trying to guess the strategies of other players, based on your interpretation of their behaviour, and react accordingly.
If all that is true, then I would submit, that at any sufficiently high (i.e. non beginner) competitive level it probably comes down to luck, since I don&#x27;t really believe that the second skill described is really learnable.

I would not play low to mid stakes NLHE online at all on any side at this point personally, just too likely to run into someone using assistance that will crush you easily.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39460674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39460674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rrr_oh_man</span><span>|</span><a href="#39460651">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461875">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461395">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39460674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39460674">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, yes, and: yes.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39461395" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39461395" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tysonfurytoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39460651">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39460674">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39461497">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39461395">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39461395">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s been a surge in discussion of online cheating in poker. some online poker players certainly use real time assistance.

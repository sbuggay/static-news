In practice this probably just means forking your community onto every new platform and convincing a sustainable core of experienced users to populate the new venue, leaving the rest behind; but forking small communities often means death as they lose the critical mass of users necessary for long-term appeal.<p>For &quot;giving them a reason to stay&quot;, that means that your community has to be welcoming to new users. But also, since new users will probably be young-ish, the topic of the community itself needs to be something that young people have a reason to care about. If you&#x27;re a community of Victrola and vintage phonograph enthusiasts, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re not going to appeal to the youth no matter what you do; if your topic isn&#x27;t perennially cool, then you might have already lost the battle for longevity.<p>For &quot;having a process to pass the torch&quot;, this means you need at least a little bit of a formal structure. If you have a forum, then who runs it, who sets the rules, who enforces the rules? If the answer is &quot;one random guy&quot;, and then that random guy gets run over by a zeppelin, then you&#x27;ve lost.<p>Basically, creating sustainable, long-lasting, intergenerational communities is extremely difficult. Anything that you come up with to solve the problem is going to start looking like either a religion or a bureaucracy.</div><br/><div id="38247068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38247068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kiba</span><span>|</span><a href="#38246595">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38246686">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38246632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38247068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38247068">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Forums are perfectly fine and has been around forever.</div><br/><div id="38247288" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38247288" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kibwen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38246595">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38247068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38246632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38247288">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38247288">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love forums, they&#x27;re great.

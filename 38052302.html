A charter house or two could easily be set up with positions offered to people who are filling these roles, providing them with a minimum of support — at the very least, free rent and free high-speed internet. These people are professionals, so this may not be enough for them — but there’s no reason they can’t get support from the charter house and make additional money in other ways. They can supplement that support by consulting, getting a real job, being a bounty hunter, etc.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here, but I&#x27;m not sold on why this charter house arrangement is better (for either side involved) than just... paying people a salary.<p>Certainly it&#x27;s easier to do regular payroll than to buy a huge house and be its landlord (really leaning into the &quot;lord&quot; part) and manage its residents&#x27; food + housing + transportation + healthcare needs. Most of that can be purchased with plain old money, and employers can offer insurance to employees without having to be their landlord too.<p>And then on the residents&#x27; side... it&#x27;s bad enough <i>now</i> that I&#x27;ll have to get a new health insurance policy if I quit my job, but if I had to find a new roof over my head, too? The power dynamic here doesn&#x27;t sound great.<p>Like, in the context of &quot;we want to fund a handful of random open-source contributors&quot;: if you have the funds to do this charter house thing, why not just open an LLC and use it to directly pay the people you&#x27;re trying to support? Why does a literal house need to be involved?</div><br/><div id="38053293" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38053293" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Moto7451</span><span>|</span><a href="#38053101">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38053504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38053293">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38053293">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a friend try this in upstate New York.

I lived in several different 5-7 bedroom communal houses in SF with a bunch of founders&#x2F;engineers and if everyone (or even half the people) have high paying jobs then it&#x27;s a very different experience. The group can easily absorb months of another resident&#x27;s rent if they have volatile income which greatly reduces the pressure on relationships.<p>It only costs a few hundred bucks a week to have cleaners come over and take care of the house so most chores are a none issue. Dishes and trash were the only rotating chores IIRC since those couldn&#x27;t be put off between weekly cleanings. There was a fridge for personal food and a separate communal fridge with a group food budget so all staples were always taken care of. Internet, insurance, water, power, were all split equally. There were no problems concerning the money even though some people were messier, some ate at home more, some worked from home entirely, etc. etc.<p>That&#x27;s a far flung situation from the one described in TFA though.

They&#x27;re not in the game to hire US people, it&#x27;s all about funneling as many Southeast Asians as possible here.<p>Talking to many friends over years having been through it to come here, I view it a bit like old (like 18th century old) indentured servitude of Europeans trying to get to the US however possible that they&#x27;d sell themselves into contractual slavery as &quot;indentured servitude&quot;. It was later stopped, but for a time it was a good deal for everyone involved, wink wink. The slaver&#x2F;outsourcer got cheap labor showing up to sign away, now a captive workforce, all to get shipped off to the promised land with the hope the poor bastard can pay off the debt working for nothing near what the slaver&#x2F;outsourcer gets, all while waiting on an immigration list that may never happen.<p>It&#x27;s all better than anything they&#x27;ll get in their home land, so they&#x27;ll bet big and do anything just to get to the US to drop an anchor kid to force naturalization. Same(ish) game from 200-some years ago, just with a modern progressive spin and abuse of terrible government regimes.<p>The other scam is they run them through Canada for quicker immigration than US, and then just move to the US as Canadian citizens faster than waiting on a direct list to the US. Anything for that Murican dream and soaking up Murican dollars.<p>Now with this despotic regime for 2025, we&#x27;ll see how immigration works out, but all the slavers pay big lobbies, so they&#x27;ll keep on keeping on for sure.</div><br/><div id="42385959" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42385959" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">margorczynski</span><span>|</span><a href="#42385839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42385974">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42385959">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42385959">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; US to drop an anchor kid to force naturalization<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered why the US didn&#x27;t change this law (to right of blood)?

There is nothing hyperbolic about Project 2025. The Heritage Foundation, a prominent Republican think tank, is spearheading it. Hundreds of high-ranking politicians and corporate executives are on board with it. The entire administration is going to push for it, systematically, and get as far as they can.

When I was in college, a dorm neighbor told me that Obama had said&#x2F;did something bad. I don&#x27;t remember what, but it was incredibly dubious. I told him I didn&#x27;t believe it and asked him to prove it; I&#x27;d even accept a Fox News article as evidence. He was red in the face because he couldn&#x27;t find any article suggesting anything close to what he had said. Looking back on it now, I realize he <i>genuinely believed</i> what he had heard, but he had fallen for well-crafted language that created a new reality. It was so well-crafted, all that remained was the idea he was propagandized to believe rather than even a remnant of the title of the original article.<p>This same thing has happened to me over the years - I read an article and then it becomes relevant in some future discussion. I find the article (which is hard to find, because I&#x27;m searching by <i>what the author[s] wanted me to think</i>, not the actual article content) and read it again, only to find out that, upon a more critical reading, it doesn&#x27;t say what I thought it said at all! Or the conclusion is much weaker than I had originally thought.<p>It&#x27;s pretty amazing to see, though. Weak evidence used to support very strong American propaganda about seemingly weak Chinese propaganda. The goal posts inevitably get moved too - oh we have strong evidence of it, but we might tip off the Chinese! Like, huh? What does it matter if they&#x27;re tipped off if you&#x27;re going to force the sale?<p>I also don&#x27;t think TikTok was ever a national security threat, at least not any more than any other social media platform. What are (were?) all the DoD recruiters and other military influencer accounts on TikTok like Nikko Ortiz (a counter intelligence agent from &#x27;18-&#x27;23) doing on TikTok?  It was wild to see how during certain recruitment pushes, my   FYP would be like a direct view into a platoon headquarters. (And yes, before anyone responds, US military social media policies like being aware of adversaries using social media predates the popularization of TikTok, no need to speculate about them not knowing that TT was a threat, especially not after the first ban attempt during the Trump administration)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42746817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42746817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdhb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42745037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42746692">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42746884">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42746598">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42746817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42746817">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the question is actually asked incorrectly in the reverse.<p>Maybe start with the not at all controversial position that China is effectively an authoritarian dictatorship who is well known to use censorship and public manipulation as one of its key levers of control and then ask if you have any evidence whatsoever that for some reason they wouldnât include TikTok in that mix?<p>The way actual professionals in the field look at this problem is through a lens of:<p>1.

For example, &quot;hate speech&quot; isn&#x27;t actually one of the things the government is allowed to prohibit under the First Amendment.<p>But then the government passed a whole bunch of laws they don&#x27;t actually enforce, and then instead of actually enforcing them, they started <i>threatening</i> to enforce them if platforms didn&#x27;t start censoring the stuff the government wanted them to, i.e. &quot;take that stuff down or we&#x27;ll charge you with the antitrust violations you&#x27;re already committing&quot;.<p>This is basically an end-run around the constitution for free speech in the same way as parallel construction is for illegal searches and the courts should put a stop to it, but they haven&#x27;t yet and it&#x27;s not clear if or when they will, so it&#x27;s still a problem.<p>&gt; It is also not clear to me how TikTok is supposed to provide better &quot;checks and balances&quot; just because it is owned and manipulated by the Chinese Communist Party.<p>Suppose you have one platform that censors criticism of the current US administration and another platform that censors videos of Tienanmen. This is better than only having one of those things, because you can then get the first one from the second one and vice versa.</div><br/><div id="42746779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42746779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blackqueeriroh</span><span>|</span><a href="#42745037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42746598">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42746344">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42746779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42746779">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What laws did they pass that they didnât enforce but then threatened to enforce?

The profit motive is fundamentally opposed to a low-intervention platform for democratic communication. For a brief period we had some social media platforms that made gestures in the direction of free communication. Then the investor capital came rolling in, and they were expected to increase revenue. How do you increase revenue of your <i>free</i> communication platform? You sell the messaging. Call it promotion, advertising, whatever. The only thing of value you have at your disposal are people&#x27;s eyeball, you&#x27;re going to sell what they see. You could ask your users to pay for the service... but then 80% of them will flake to a rival service that&#x27;s still free.

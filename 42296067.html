Pat&#x27;s strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.<p>Intel&#x27;s stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don&#x27;t think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.<p>What this likely means is two-fold:<p>1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and&#x2F;or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.<p>2. Pat is&#x2F;was unwilling to split the foundry and design business &#x2F; be part of a M&amp;A but the board wants to do one or the other.<p>If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.</div><br/><div id="42296512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42296512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phkahler</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296393">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42300070">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42296512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42296512">[121 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD.<p>Aside from the x86 monopoly that would create, I don&#x27;t think Intel has much of value to AMD at this point other than the fabs (which aren&#x27;t delivering). IMHO if Intel is failing, let them fail and others will buy the pieces in bankruptcy. This would probably benefit several other companies that could use 22nm and up fab capacity and someone could even pick up the x86 and graphics businesses.<p>BTW I think at this point the graphics business is more valuable. Even though Intel is in 3rd place there are many players in the SoC world that can use a good GPU.

My experience with OpenCL was that it&#x27;s really a PITA to work with.  The thing that CUDA makes nice is the direct and minimal exercise to start running GPGPU kernels.  write the code, compile with nvcc, cudaed.<p>OpenCL had just a weird dance to perform to get a kernel running.  Find the OpenCL device using a magic filesystem token.  Ask the device politely if it wants to OpenCL.  Send over the kernel string blob to compile.  Run the kernel.  A ton of ceremony and then you couldn&#x27;t be guarenteed it&#x27;d work because the likes of AMD, Intel, or nVidia were all spotty on how well they&#x27;d support it.<p>SYCL seems promising but the ecosystem is a little intimidating.

Programmers have a predictable response to that sort of silliness. Build a library over it &amp; abstract it away. The sheer number of frameworks out there is awe-inspiring.<p>I gave up on OpenCL on AMD cards. It wasn&#x27;t the long complex process that got me, it was the unavoidable crashes along the way. I suspect that is a more significant issue than I realised at the time (when I assumed it was just me) because it goes a long way to explain AMD&#x27;s pariah-like status in the machine learning world. The situation is more one-sided than can be explained by just a well-optimised library. I&#x27;ve personally seen more success implementing machine learning frameworks on AMD CPUs than on AMD&#x27;s GPUs, and that is a remarkable thing. Although I assume in 2024 the state of the game has changed a lot from when I was investigating the situation actively.<p>I don&#x27;t think CUDA is the problem here, math libraries are commodity software that give a relatively marginal edge. The lack of CUDA is probably a symptom of deeper hardware problems once people stray off an explicitly graphical workflow. If the hardware worked to spec I expect someone would just build a non-optimised CUDA clone and we&#x27;d all move on. But AMD did build a CUDA clone and it didn&#x27;t work for me at least - and the buzz suggests something is still going wrong for AMD&#x27;s GPGPU efforts.</div><br/><div id="42303517" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303517" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Const-me</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296393">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302793">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42303283">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303517">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303517">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Programmers have a predictable response to that sort of silliness.

My wife is my anecdotal example. She&#x27;s had a mac for years but refuses to give Apple one more penny because they&#x27;ve been awful - had to replace her previous laptop motherboard 7 times until we finally had to sue Apple in a class action which resulted in them sending her current 2015 MBP, which has now aged-out of MacOS updates. Sucks that this computer is now basically a paperweight.<p>Anyway, in my questions for her about what she really cares about in a new laptop, power efficiency was not a concern of hers. She does not care about efficiency at all. All she cared about was a good enough screen (2560x1440 or better), and a fast CPU to run the new Photoshop features, and the ability to move it from one location to another (hence the need for a laptop instead of a desktop). I&#x27;d wager that for most people, the fact that it&#x27;s a portable computer has nothing to do with how long the battery lasts away from an outlet. She can transport the computer to another location and plug it in. There are very few situations that require extended use away from an outlet, and even in an airplane, we often see 120V outlets at the seats. There&#x27;s really no use case for her that puts her away from an outlet for longer than an hour or two, so efficiency is the least of her concerns in buying a new laptop.<p>So we went with a new Dell laptop with the Intel i9-13900HX, which beats the Apple M4 Max 16 Core in terms of overall performance in CPU benchmarks. I would have looked at an AMD based laptop, but the price on this Dell and the performance of the i9 were great, it was $999 on sale. It&#x27;s got a decent enough screen, and we can easily upgrade the RAM and storage on this laptop.<p>I doubt she&#x27;d even care if the new laptop <i>didn&#x27;t have a battery at all</i>, so long as she can easily stuff it in a bag and carry it to another location and plug it in. I feel the exact same way, and I recently bought a new (AMD based) laptop, and power efficiency was not a thing in my decision making process at all. The battery lasts a few hours, and that&#x27;s plenty. I don&#x27;t get a hard-on for battery life, and I&#x27;m not really sure who does.

There are two major problems I saw: lack of genuine interest in fabs (most people are there for the Intel name and then leave or in the case of Indians, they are there for Visa purposes. Mind you, we were not allowed to hire people from China since Intel is subject to Export laws). The biggest problem by far is lack of talent. Most of the talent I know is either at Apple or Facebook&#x2F;Google, including those trained in hardware. Intel is bound to crumble, so I hope we as taxpayers don&#x27;t foot the bill.

And Intel has benefits and stock packages that rival those of big tech. I think I can expand on your point by saying the more senior engineers were risk averse and on the verge of retirement, and the young engineers were just there for the Intel name or some other reason. There is surprisingly very few middle-aged long-term people down there. This would be expected in software (Facebook&#x2F;Google), but it is a recipe for disaster in hardware where long term thinking is critical to advance lithography (changed don&#x27;t happen overnight). I also was surprised by how few of Intel&#x27;s engineers believed in Intel. The most stark observation I made was senior engineers would max their stock purchase plan, but many young engineers would abstain. If the engineers don&#x27;t believe in the product they are working on, I don&#x27;t accept that the gov. must bail it out. I hope some investigative journalist writes a book on Intel and Boeing someday, as I would be curious as to how things unfolded and got to this point. There are many similarities (I never worked for Boeing, but have friends in Seattle that describe the culture in similar terms to what I saw at Intel). Also, to your last point, the Intel name does not hold as much weight as it did in the Grove days.</div><br/><div id="42302611" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302611" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lotsofpulp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42300028">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302611">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302611">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; And Intel has benefits and stock packages that rival those of big tech.<p>Given Intel’s stock returns over the past 15 years, Intel would have to offer insane cash compensation to rival big tech.<p>Levels.fyi indicates Intel heavily underpays, which is what I would expect.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levels.fyi&#x2F;?compare=Intel,Apple,Google&amp;track=Software%20Engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levels.fyi&#x2F;?compare=Intel,Apple,Google&amp;track=Sof...</a></div><br/><div id="42302757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42302757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MPSFounder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42300028">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42302611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42302757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42302757">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Should have mentioned Hardware.

I suppose AMD may have bought more wafers if their products didn’t suck for most of that time but it had nothing to do with shifting production to TSMC which only happened after GloFo gave up.</div><br/><div id="42297939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42297939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jpalawaga</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296139">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42297645">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42301742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42297939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42297939">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">right. so glofo couldn&#x27;t keep up abandoned the bleeding edge. what&#x27;s the evidence that intel foundaries, divorced from design, wouldn&#x27;t suffer the same fate?</div><br/><div id="42300534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42300534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manquer</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296139">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42297939">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299400">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42300534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42300534">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No evidence, intel doesn&#x27;t have the resources to be fighting tsmc, and, arm and nvidia, apple and samsung in different technologies at the same time.( foundry, gpus, cpus, NAND ,SSD etc)

The RTX 3070 Ti has both more compute and more memory bandwidth. The only advantage the A770 has on its side is triple the L2 cache.<p>To make matters worse for Intel, I am told that games tend to use vendor specific extensions to improve shader performance and those extensions are of course not going to be available to Intel GPUs running the same game. I am under the impression that this is one of the reasons why DXVK cannot outperform the Direct3D native stack on Nvidia GPUs. The situation is basically what Intel did to AMD with its compiler and the MKL in reverse.<p>In specific, information in these extensions is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpuopen.com&#x2F;amd-gpu-services-ags-library&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gpuopen.com&#x2F;amd-gpu-services-ags-library&#x2F;</a>

I remember seeing AMD advertising the extension years ago, but I cannot find a reference when I search for it now. I believe the DXVK developers would know what it is if asked, as they are the ones that told me about it (as per my recollection).<p>Anyway, Intel entered the market with the cards stacked against it because of these extensions. On the bright side, it is possible for Intel to level the playing field by implementing the Vulkan extensions that its competitors use to get an edge, but that will not help it in Direct3D performance. I am not sure if it is possible for Intel to implement those as they are tied much more closely with their competitors’ drivers. That said, this is far from my area of expertise.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42297091" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42297091" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timschmidt</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296139">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296922">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42297205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42297091">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42297091">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; He failed on GPU.

My career at Intel coincided with Pat&#x27;s, although I jumped ship a little earlier. Admittedly this means I probably have a little bias, but based on my hundreds of conversations with Intel vets I do think his business strategy was the right decision. He came on board a company years behind on process, packaging, and architecture technology after years of mismanagement by a largely nontechnical staff, which favoured buybacks and acquisitions over core business practice.<p>He had two routes with the capital available following a cash injection from COVID-19 and the rapid digitization of the workplace - compete with AMD&#x2F;NVIDIA, or compete with TSMC&#x2F;Samsung. The only sensible option that would capture the kind of capital needed to turn the ship around would be to become a company critical to the national security of the US, during a time of geopolitical stability, onshoring chip manufacture and receiving support from the government in doing so. He could either compete with competitors at home or those abroad, but not both simultaneously. The thesis makes sense; you&#x27;ve lost the advantage to NVIDIA&#x2F;AMD, so pivot to become a partner rather than a rival.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that just a week after Intel finally received the grant from the government, he announced his departure. The CHIPS act was a seminal moment in his career. It makes sense he&#x27;d want to see that through till completion.

That people fed into this messianic complex by viewing him as &quot;the return of the engineer&quot; was further problematic.  To be clear:  when Gelsinger arrived in 2021, the company was in deep crisis.  It needed a leader who could restore it to technical leadership, but could do so by making some tough changes (namely, the immediate elimination of the dividend and a very significant reduction in head count).  In contrast, what Gelsinger did was the worst of all paths:  allowed for a dividend to be paid out for far (FAR!) too long and never got into into really cutting the middle management undergrowth.  Worst of all, things that WERE innovative at Intel (e.g., Tofino) were sloppily killed, destroying the trust that Intel desperately needs if it is to survive.<p>No one should count Intel out (AMD&#x27;s resurrection shows what&#x27;s possible here!), but Intel under Gelsinger was an unmitigated disaster -- and a predictable one.</div><br/><div id="42298292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42298292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hedgehog</span><span>|</span><a href="#42297987">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42298024">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42298292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42298292">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re wrong but the overarching structure of the chip business is very different from times gone by.

Please just bring him back as CEO.&quot; - 2012 on HN, when Paul Otellini Retired.</i><p>&gt;<i>&quot;The only one who may have a slim chance to completely transform Intel is Pat Gelsinger, if Andy Grove saved Intel last time, it will be his apprentice to save Intel again. Unfortunately given what Intel has done to Pat during his last tenure, I am not sure if he is willing to pick up the job, especially the board&#x27;s Chairman is Bryant, not sure how well they go together. But we know Pat still loves Intel, and I know a lot of us miss Pat.&quot; [2] - June, 2018</i><p>I am sad to read this. As I wrote [2] only a few hours ago about how the $8B from Chip ACT is barely anything if US &#x2F; Intel wants to compete with TSMC.<p>Unfortunately there were lot of things that didn&#x27;t go to plan. Or from my reading of it was out of his control. Cutting Dividends was a No No from Board until late. Big Cut of headcount wasn&#x27;t allowed until too late. Basically he was tasked to turn the ship around rapidly, not allow to rock the ship too much all while it has leaky water at the bottom. And I will again, like I have already wrote in [1], point the finger at the board.<p>My reading of this is that it is a little too late to save Intel, both as foundry and chip making. Having Pat &quot;<i>retired</i>&quot; would likely mean the board is now planning to sell Intel off since Pat would likely be the biggest opponents to this idea.<p>At less than $100B I am sure there are plenty of interested buyers for various part of Intel. Broadcomm could be one. Qualcomm or may be even AMD. I am just not sure who will take the Foundry or if the Foundry will be a separate entity.<p>I dont want Pat and Intel to end like this. But the world is unforgiving and cruel. I have been watching TSMC grow and cheer leading them in 2010 before 99.99% of the internet even heard of its name and I know their game far too well. So I know competing against TSMC is a task that is borderline impossible in many aspect. But I would still wanted to see Pat bring Intel back to leading edge again.

With this news most are expecting they&#x27;ll be (further) delayed soon, but the real cause of today&#x27;s action is strategic.<p>Things at Intel are so far gone that there&#x27;s now no choice but to look at splitting up the company and&#x2F;or selling&#x2F;merging key parts off. Pat didn&#x27;t want to preside over breaking up Intel, he wanted to save the company by shipping the new nodes. This was always a long shot plan which would require the existing businesses to do well and new things like GPUs to contribute while massively cutting costs in other areas.<p>Those things didn&#x27;t work out. The GPUs were late and under performed forcing them to be sold near break even. The market for desktop and laptop CPUs was much softer than expected for macro economic reasons and, worse, there were massive, delayed death field failures of the last two gens of desktop CPUs. Competitors like AMD generally took more share from Intel faster than expected in other markets like data center. The big layoffs announced last Summer should have been done in 2021. Those things combined caused time and money to run out sooner than the new nodes could show up to save the day. This is reality finally being acknowledged. Frankly, this should have happened last Summer or even earlier. Now the value has eroded further making it even harder to save what&#x27;s left.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42297384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42297384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RandyOrion</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296271">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299389">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42297384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42297384">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From a customer&#x27;s perspective:

So Intel has issues with either yield, pricing or other barriers to adoption of their latest.<p>2. The ARC GPUs are way behind; it seems obvious to me that a way to increase usage and sales is to simply add more VRAM to the GPUs - Nvidia limits the 4090 to 24GB; so if Intel shipped a GPU with 48 or 64GB VRAM, more people would buy those just to have the extra VRAM.

One still has to apply reason and common sense, but I would not dream of saying it has no ( any ) wisdom.<p>&lt;&lt; What made Nvidia dominant was not weak GPUs with a lot of RAM.<p>I assume you mean: &#x27;not in isolation&#x27;. If so, that statement is true. AMD cards at the very least had parity with nvidia, so it clearly wasn&#x27;t just a question of ram.<p>&lt;&lt; The puzzle of their success had way more pieces that made the whole package appealing over many years, and a great timing of the market also helped.<p>I will be honest. I am biased against nvidia so take the next paragraph for the hate speech that it is.<p>Nvidia got lucky. CUDA was a big bet that paid off first on crypto and now on ai. Now, we can argue how much of that bet was luck meets preparation, because the bet itself was admittedly a well educated guess.<p>To your point, without those two waves, nvidia would still likely be battling amd in incremental improvements so the great market timing accounts for majority of its success. I will go as far as to say that we would likely not see a rush to buy &#x27;a100s&#x27; and &#x27;AI accellerators&#x27; with exception of very niche applications.<p>&lt;&lt;  Intel making underperforming GPUs with a lot of RAM would not guarantee the same outcome at a later time in the market with an already entrenched Nvidia and a completely different landscape.<p>Underperforming may be the key word here and it is a very broad brush. In what sense are they underperforming and which segment are they intended for? As for ram, it would be kinda silly in current environment to put a new card out with 8gb; I think we can agree on that at least.<p>&lt;&lt; I&#x27;m saying nobody can guarantee the claim of the GP I&#x27;ve replied to,<p>True, but it is true for just about every aspect of life so as statements go, so it is virtually meaningless as an argument. Best one can do is argue possibilities based on what we do know about the world and the models it tends to follow.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42300581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42300581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rvba</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296109">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296382">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296503">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42299412">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42300581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42300581">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many people here are very knowledgeable: they have Putnams, they are CEOs smurfing, run 300 people teams, made some software that all know (e.g. we have the Diablo 2 guy), people from hardare side, VCs..<p>Some are probably multi millionaires smurfing (and I dont mean cryptobros).<p>Do you even have a Putnam award?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42298435" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42298435" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bubblethink</span><span>|</span><a href="#42296109">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296362">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42296222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42298435">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42298435">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;The only stupid thing they did was not getting into GPUs earlier<p>Intel has been &quot;getting into&quot; GPUs for two decades now going back to Larrabee.

I know people who are naturally observant and quite good at this. As I think about it this is really what makes Sherlock Holmes so interesting too.<p>What&#x27;s changing is the scope, scale and access. It&#x27;s no longer necessary to be a savant or have a special talent - all you need are hundreds of banal data points easily scooped from the meta data wake we all leave. Not to mention it can be programmed and commoditized instead of being a special attribute of another human. The realization feels a bit like climate change in that some folks saw it coming, pointed it out, articulated the issues, underestimated how fast it would actually arrive and how profound the impact would be.<p>But back to the point at hand you can&#x27;t legislate people not see what is publicly before them. You might criminalize recording that data for a while but that doesn&#x27;t seem to work long term thought it&#x27;s brutal in the short term. If you can record that data you can analyze that data. From analysis comes inferences and decisions and actions.<p>I think the more salient question is about equality. I have some ability to obfuscate my meta data wake but as an individual it&#x27;s pretty limited. Apple, google, Amazon have much more ability to do so despite leaving a gazillion more bits of data laying around. Tools individuals can use to obscure our meta data trail will do more to maintain privacy than trying to tell someone observing me what they can and can&#x27;t do with their observations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38272913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38272913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nl</span><span>|</span><a href="#38274486">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38273364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38272913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38272913">[25 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is moderately interesting work but the title feels wrong to me.<p>They use LLMs to analyse social media and turn unstructured text (&quot;I always get stuck waiting for a hook turn&quot;) into structured data (location=Melbourne, Australia).<p>They test this on a set of Reddit profiles that have been hand labelled.<p>However, the fact that this hand labeling is possible indicates in itself that the issue isn&#x27;t a pure privacy violation.

I will personally say my opinions on free speech have also changed. Given how highly targeted, systematic and relentless well-funded misinformation campaigns can be, the old assumptions I had about free speech (&quot;Given enough daylight, the majority of people will walk away from &#x27;bad&#x27; ideas&quot;) I no longer believe to be true. I really don&#x27;t have any idea what the &quot;right&quot; solution is, just that my views have changed.<p>The primary point is that wide scale, incredibly cheap data analysis (now being supercharged with AI) basically breaks all these fundamental assumptions and ideas society has, which is one reason why the world seems to be in such turmoil.</div><br/><div id="38273537" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38273537" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">downboots</span><span>|</span><a href="#38273364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38273794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38273537">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38273537">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Log_2(8 billion people) = ~33 yes&#x2F;no questions</div><br/></div></div><div id="38273794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38273794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmugan</span><span>|</span><a href="#38273364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38273537">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38272903">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38273794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38273794">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I first saw Interstellar I thought it was unrealistic that people could be brainwashed to forget about space flight.

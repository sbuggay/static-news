This should provide ample time to initiate and complete a Green Card application under Employment-Based 2nd preference.<p>However, I would consider choosing the H1-B visa for the following reasons:<p>It’s getting harder to get L1-B because USCIS are asking more questions about if a candidate has specialized knowledge to meet the requirements.<p>The processing times for Green Cards and PERM are increasing and five years might not be enough in the near future. In that case you would need a very cooperative employer to allow you to continue the application via Consular Processing from the UK.<p>My own Green Card application began in 2022, and I’m not likely to receive it until 2026 due to the substantial backlog for applicants from the Rest of the World (ROW) category, which includes British-born individuals.<p>On an L1 visa, you’ll be tied to your current job until either your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) arrives and you have portability under AC21, you’re approved for an H1-B visa with a different employer (which will reset your Green Card application timeline); or you’re approved for a Green Card.<p>If you switch to an H1-B visa, you have the flexibility to change jobs before your Green Card is approved. You can also retain your Priority Date (PD), which represents your position in the Green Card queue, although you’ll need to restart all the steps of the process again. Additionally, your H1-B visa is extendable indefinitely after receiving an approved I-140 petition.<p>This immigration system here is a mess and it’s getting worse.

2. This requires a discussion unfortunately because if you look at the websites of 10 different schools, you will get 10 different views on whether an F-1 can get STEM OPT through their own company.

U.S. immigration by employment is sadly almost entirely based on petitions filed <i>by your employer</i>. The choice of which visa pathway to pursue is not up to you.<p>If you&#x27;re curious: the vast majority of Europeans currently moving to the U.S. for tech jobs typically do so on L-1A or L-1B visas. To qualify, you must work for at least 12 months at the European subsidiary of a U.S. company before being transferred to a U.S. office. There are the occasional O-1 cases but you need significant work experience and recognition to qualify. Lawyers will definitely ask you questions to determine whether you are a good candidate for it.<p>In the past, H-1B was a way more common route, especially when there was no lottery or at least when selection odds were higher. However, with current lottery odds at just 10-15%, many companies now prefer hiring you abroad and then going for an L-1. As long as you satisfy the foreign work requirement, you are more or less guaranteed approval for an L-1 and there is no uncertainty.<p>Companies also love transferring employees on L-1 because unlike H-1B it is an employer-tied visa. This means you cannot switch to a different employer, effectively locking you in for the duration of your employment until you obtain a green card, if and when that happens. Keep that in mind if you are offered an L-1: you should carefully consider the green card pathways offered by your employer before you move.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42770314" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42770314" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DiggyJohnson</span><span>|</span><a href="#42770264">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42770560">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42773916">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42770314">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42770314">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What industry, size of company, and role(s) are you targeting?</div><br/><div id="42770633" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42770633" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kubb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42770264">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42770314">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42773916">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42770633">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42770633">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m a senior SWE in big tech.

I recently got &quot;CERTIFIED&quot; on my PERM and the lawyers are working to get my I-140 ready to file. I have some publications as first author and as a co-author is a highly respected journal.<p>I wanted to know if there is a path to move from EB2 to EB1? If there is, what would be the requirements to qualify? I ask this my I-140 priority date is late 2024, and the current date for my nationality is 2012. EB1 current date seems to be 2022. Is it possible to move to EB1 and carry over the priority date from the (hopefully approved) I-140?<p>Many thanks!

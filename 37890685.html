I remember running an analysis that found that gender was a significant explaining factor for behavior on our site; my boss asked (dismissively): What can we do with that information? If there is an assumption of how things work that doesn’t translate to a product change, that insight isn’t useful; if there is a product intuition, testing the product change itself is key, and there’s no reason to delay that.<p>There are cases where RCTs are hard to organize (for example, multi-sided platform businesses) of changes that can’t be tested in isolation (major brand changes). Those tend to benefit from the techniques described there——and they have dedicated teams. But this is a classic case of a complicated tool that doesn’t fit most use cases.</div><br/><div id="37891305" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37891305" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">riedel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37890964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37891682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37891305">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37891305">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Actually causal inference is also really hard to benchmark.

Today most tech companies worship a&#x2F;b experiments as the main way of being data-driven and bringing causality into decision-making. It deserves to be the gold standard.<p>However, most experiments are usually expensive: they require investing in building the feature in question and then collecting data for 1-4 weeks before being certain of the effects (plus there are long-term ones to worry about). Some companies report that fewer than 50% of their experiments prove truly impactful (my experience as well). That’s why only a small number of business decisions are made using experiments today.<p>Observational causal inference offers another approach, trading off full confidence in causality with speed and cost.

But usually you know more than one variable association, so this is more an issue of pedagogy than the tool itself.<p>Probably the shortest, most persuasive example I can give you is a logical resolution to Simpson&#x27;s Paradox: when the correlation between two variables can change depending on whether you consider a third variable or not.<p>The classic example is gender discrimination in college admissions. When looking at admissions rates across the entire university, women are less likely to be accepted than men. But when (in this example) you break that down into departments, every department favors women over men. This is a paradoxical contradiction, and worrying in that your science is only as good as the dimensions your data captures. Worse, the data offers no clean way to say which is the correct answer: the aggregate or the total. Statisticians stumbled for a long while on this, and it&#x27;s kind of wild that we were able to declare smoking causes cancer without a resolution to this.<p>Pearl wrote a paper on how bayesian approaches resolve the paradox[1], but it does presume familiarity with terms like &quot;colliders,&quot; &quot;backdoor criterion&quot; and &quot;do-calculus.&quot; His main point is that causal inference techniques give us the language and tools to resolve the paradox that frequentist approaches do not.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;pub&#x2F;stat_ser&#x2F;r414.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;pub&#x2F;stat_ser&#x2F;r414.pdf</a></div><br/><div id="37895628" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37895628" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FreakLegion</span><span>|</span><a href="#37893312">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37894195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37895905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37895628">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37895628">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>When looking at admissions rates across the entire university, women are less likely to be accepted than men.

Any time I&#x27;ve discussed research on human subjects with doctors doing that research, the discussion of what is and is not an acceptable experiment has always been primarily driven by the risks of harm to the people involved in the study. Any time the law comes up, it&#x27;s usually because the law <i>requires</i> an RCT in a specific setting, as opposed to preventing it (e.g. drug trials). (Of course in the setting of starting a company based on some medical product, the situation may be quite different.)<p>Biologists, if not data scientists, are used to considering indirect evidence for causality. It&#x27;s why we sometimes accept studies performed in other organisms as evidence for biology in humans; it&#x27;s why we sometimes accept research performed on post-mortem human tissue as being representative of the biology of living humans; to name but a few examples. A big part of a compelling high-impact biology (or bioinformatics) paper is often the innovative ways that one comes up to show causality when a direct RCT is not feasible, and papers are frequently rejected because they don&#x27;t to the follow-up experiments required to show causality.</div><br/><div id="37892814" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37892814" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mwexler</span><span>|</span><a href="#37891354">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37891506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37891193">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37892814">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37892814">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a very fair point.

You have to remember that datasets are proxies for the thing you&#x27;re actually trying to model, they are not the thing you are modeling themselves. You can usually see this when testing on in class but out of train&#x2F;test distribution data (e.g. data from someone else).<p>You have to be careful because there are a lot of small and non-obvious things that can fuck up statistics. There&#x27;s a lot of aggregation &quot;paradoxes&quot; (Simpsons, Berkson&#x27;s), and all kinds of things that can creep in. This is more perilous the bigger your model too. The story of the Monte Hall problem is a great example of how easy it is to get the wrong answer while it seems like you&#x27;re doing all the right steps.<p>For the article, the author is far too handwavy with causal inference. The reason we tend not to do it is because it is fucking hard and it scales poorly. Models like Autoregressive (careful here) and Normalizing Flows can do causal inference (and causal discovery) fwiw (essentially you need explicit density models with tractable densities: referring to Goodfellow&#x27;s taxonomy). But things get funky as you get a lot of variables because there are indistinguishable causal graphs (see Hyvarien and Pajunen). Then there&#x27;s also the issues with the types of causalities (see Judea&#x27;s Ladder) and counterfactual inference is FUCKING HARD but the author just acts like it&#x27;s no big deal. Then he starts conflating it with weaker forms of causal inference. Correlation is the weakest form of causation, despite our often chanted saying of &quot;correlation does not equate to causation&quot; (which is still true, it&#x27;s just in the class and the saying is more getting at confounding variable). This very much does not scale. Similarly discovery won&#x27;t scale as you have to permute so many variables in the graph.

You have to remember that 1) all models are wrong and 2) it&#x27;s models all the way down. Your data is a model: it models the real world distribution, what we might call the target distribution, which is likely intractable and often very different from your data in various conditions. Your metrics are models: obviously given the previous point, but not as obvious from the point that even with perfect data these are still models. Your metrics all have limitations and you must be careful to clearly understand what they are measuring, rather than what you think they are. This is an issue of alignment and the vast majority of people do not consider precisely what their metrics mean and instead rely on the general consensus (great ML example: FID does not measure fidelity, it is distance measurement of distributions. But you shouldn&#x27;t stop there, that&#x27;s the start). These get especially fuzzy in higher dimensions where geometries are highly non-intuitive. It is best to remember that metrics are guides and not targets (Goodhart).<p>&gt; There should be some way to determine a model&#x27;s likelihood of structure beyond &quot;trust me, it works!&quot; If there is, I&#x27;m trying to understand it!<p>I mean we can use likelihood ;) if we model density of course. But that&#x27;s not the likelihood that your model is the correct model, it is the likelihood that given the data that you have that your model&#x27;s parameterization can reasonably model the sampling distribution of data. These are subtly different, the difference is from above. And then we gotta know if you&#x27;re actually operating on the right number of dimensions. Are you approximating PCA like a typical VAE? Is the bottleneck enough for proper parameterization? Is your data in sufficient dimensionality? Does the fucking manifold hypothesis even hold for your data? What about the distribution assumption?

First, we build a model that predicts the treatment variable based on the input variables . Then, we create a separate model that predicts the outcome variable using the same set of input variables . Subsequently, we calculate the residuals from the former model and regress them against the residuals from the latter model. An important feature of this method is its flexibility in accommodating non-linear models, which allows us to capture non-linear relationships — a distinctive advantage of this approach.<p>Just... don&#x27;t do this.

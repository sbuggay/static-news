Full coverage of any validation errors via mock network responses.<p>I then wrote a web AudioWorklet for playing PCM in 3 minutes, which complied to the same interface as my Mac&#x2F;iOS&#x2F;Android versions, ex. Setting sample rate, feedback callback, etc. I have no idea what an AudioWorklet is.<p>Two days ago, I stubbed out my implementation of OpenAI&#x27;s web socket based realtime API, 1400 LOC over 2 days, mostly by hand while grokking and testing the API. In 32 minutes, I had a brand spanking new batch of code, clean, event-based architecture, 86% test coverage. 1.8 KLOC with tests.<p>In all of these cases, most I needed to do was drop in code files and say, nope wrong a couple times to sonnet, and say &quot;why are you violating my service contract and only providing an example solution&quot; to o1.<p>Not llama 3.1 405B specifically, I haven&#x27;t gone to the trouble of running it, but things turned some sort of significant corner over the last 3 months, between o1 and Sonnet 3.5. Mistakes are rare. Believable 405B is on that scale, IIRC it went punch for punch with the original 3.5 Sonnet.<p>But I find it hard to believe a Google L3, and third of L4s, (read: new hires, or survived 3 years) are that productive and sending code out for review at a 1&#x2F;5th of that volume, much less on demand.<p>So insane-sounding?

The hardware is buggy, the firmware is buggy, the drivers are buggy, every layer above it (compilers, kernels, multiple layers of frameworks) also all buggy. Add on top of that everyone is implementing as fast as they can, every part is changing constantly, and also a good chunk of the code being used is being written by researchers and grad students. Oh, and the hardware changes dramatically every couple years. Sure all tech is swiss cheese, but this is a particularly unstable&#x2F;treacherous version of that atm.<p>BTW, shareholders obviously have no idea whether what&#x27;s being sold works well or not, but there&#x27;s no financial incentive (in terms of selling stuff&#x2F;profiting) if your product doesn&#x27;t even work&#x2F;work well enough to compete.

Sure there are network effects, but if I could run PyTorch (or really, just train and inference my models easily) faster and cheaper, me, and I assume lots of other people would switch in a heartbeat. The fact that no one (besides Google arguably if you count having to switch all your implementations over for TPUs) has been able to do it, whether they be startups or multi-billion dollar companies (including Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, all who have direct financial incentive to and have been trying), points to the problem being elsewhere.</div><br/><div id="42422415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42422415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benreesman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42421528">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42421937">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42421432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42422415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42422415">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Iâm a bit out of my area on the details: but I have CUDA kernels in PyTorch and Iâve moved around much, much bigger codebases.

Previously used LoRa. For like 5 years, samples were available but FCC certification of modules (and equivalent in other countries) was coming &quot;next year&quot;. Around 2022 some FCC-certified modules were available and finally in 2023 devices finally started appearing. Note that for commercial devices using RF you generally integrate a pre-certified module and then have to get the entire device certified in a simplified process as well. In practice companies that sell to hobbyists don&#x27;t know better and don&#x27;t do this.<p>LoRA is amazing but its max datarate is 27kbps for the sub GHz version and 254kbps for the 2.4GHz version and it&#x27;s half duplex --you need to implement time multiplexing on your own or use multiple radios if you want two-way communication. It&#x27;s great for something you would do over a serial cable but not great for networking.<p>802.11ah is however great for networking because you can buy an adapter and use TCP&#x2F;IP just like ad-hoc wifi, although most products released so far use it internally and provide some other interface, like the one in the video. There is at least one access point available, and I&#x27;m kind of annoyed that&#x27;s it is an unpopular way to use the technology. I&#x27;m afraid that 802.11ah won&#x27;t take-off if most devices are proprietary bridges instead of following the wifi model of any device being able to connect to any access point.<p>Normal wifi works well globally with minor differences in power&#x2F;range, and uses basically the same frequencies and bandwidths everywhere, with a channel or two excluded in some regions. And, normal wifi devices automatically conform to the region of routers. 802.11ah is restricted to use significantly different power, frequencies, bandwidths and duty cycles in at least 10 different regions. As a result, in Indonesia, it supports a few Mbps. In Europe and Japan it supports about 12Mbps. Only in North America does it support 78Mbps.<p>So far devices are usually only certified for use in North America, if at all. You have to go out of your way to even change settings to the correct region, if it&#x27;s even possible. And since the most popular devices so far are proprietary bridges, users will buy a pair and unknowingly operate them illegally in Europe or elsewhere. The most likely outcome is import bans on devices not certified for a region. If I recall correctly using the wrong region setting can in some cases overlap with emergency services, broadcast TV and mobile networks so it will be taken seriously. I think the only realistic way for 802.1ah to &quot;take-off&quot; is for it to become a feature of normal wifi routers and have all the regional requirements locked on the router just like it is for the other wifi standards.</div><br/><div id="38908938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38908938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slow_typist</span><span>|</span><a href="#38901602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38902403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38903180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38908938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38908938">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">+1, while looking into wireless networking options for an area of 0.5 x 2.5 km with medium bandwidth requirements in Europe, 802.11ah looked like the fitting standard, but with no hardware available.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38903180" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38903180" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">synergy20</span><span>|</span><a href="#38901602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38902403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38908938">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38903180">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38903180">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the first hand insights, for &quot;then have to get the entire device certified in a simplified process&quot;, is there some link for that process?

And if you do something like change the antenna, in my understanding it&#x27;s possible to update the FCCID instead of recertifying and getting a new FCCID but you&#x27;d need support from the original vendor which is probably unlikely. It is obvious that lots of small companies do not do any testing&#x2F;certification and a lot of webshops practically encourage you to mix and match radios and antennas so I don&#x27;t think this is well-enforced anywhere.<p>One funny thing is you&#x27;re actually not supposed to change antenna types as an end user either. Radio module manufacturers are supposed to use proprietary connectors or integrated antennas to avoid this so the end user can&#x27;t just buy a high gain antenna and connect it. Unfortunately (or fortunately) this usually means they use reverse polarity SMA connectors instead of SMA connectors. RPSMA connectors became so popular that today it&#x27;s easier to buy an RPSMA antenna than an SMA antenna.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38905961" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38905961" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danwm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38901602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38902403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38903180">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38908643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38905961">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38905961">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The ones shown in the video can be configured via an odd Windows EXE that lets you use AT commands to change the parameters.

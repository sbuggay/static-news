The early 60s was the calm before the storm. The Vietnam war was barely on anyone&#x27;s radar in 1962 - there were only ~9,000 US troops there in &#x27;62 and these were being referred to as &#x27;advisors&#x27; - the vast majority of Americans didn&#x27;t even know where Vietnam was or that we had any troops there at that point. Kennedy had not yet been assassinated. The Civil Rights movement was in progress, but again, not on the radar for most Americans yet. Most Americans felt that the Soviet Union was <i>the</i> existential threat - not a lot of division about that at the time.<p>Silent Spring certainly seems to have had some major impact at the time it came out - by 1970, eight years later, we had the EPA and Earth Day. Again, it&#x27;s hard to imagine any kind of book or film coming out today that would have a similar impact on the culture at large since we now have a collection of subcultures each with their own preferred media outlets. In &#x27;62 you got your news from your local newspaper and the networks (mostly CBS &amp; NBC at that point, with ABC as sort of the upstart) - while newspapers did often have a political slant, broadcasters mostly all had the same political slant (or lack of one) due to the fairness doctrine.<p>&gt; discussion were high yet still lead to our 2020&#x27;s society being only marginally more ecologically responsible than the that of 1960&#x27;s (if that).<p>I think this has more to do with Reagan and the rise of the right wing in the 80s and into the current era. That led to backsliding on ecological progress that was made in the 60s through the 70s.

There were members of both parties who thought it likely. Also, you cite this as an example of him being wrong about an environmental issue, but that was more of an economic issue. I&#x27;m surprised you didn&#x27;t cite his opposition to nuclear power as an example of where he was wrong on an environmental issue - yes, in hindsight we now know that wasn&#x27;t the way to go, but we have to remember that in the 70s anti-nuke <i>was</i> the environmental position, while they were starting to know about climate change, they didn&#x27;t yet have the idea that nuclear power (which was becoming increasingly unpopular) would be a good way of avoiding that.<p>The other thing to remember is that Carter was warning that being dependent on <i>foreign</i> oil was bad for US national security. This was why he was doing what he could to get us to reduce our energy consumption. As for the thermostats, I don&#x27;t recall that we were being mandated to turn down the thermostats in our houses and I was there.<p>As for the inflation, he inherited a lot of that from the wartime spending expansion of his predecessors - Arab oil embargoes didn&#x27;t help. And he did name Paul Volcker to lead the Fed even though in his interview Volcker told him that the only remedy would be to drastically raise interest rates. Volcker thought that he definitely wouldn&#x27;t get the job (it was the year before an election year) so he was surprised when Carter picked him. So in that sense, Carter played a key role in killing the 70s inflation (which had been a problem even prior to Carter being elected - Remember Ford&#x27;s WIN - Whip Inflation Now - buttons?) In the end, Volcker did what he said he was going to do. 10 year treasury rates hit ~15%. The economy swooned and it was a big factor in Carter not winning re-election, but that ended up killing the 70s inflation. He had the guts to pick Volcker even though it would not be good for him politically, but he knew that it would be the best choice for the economy in the longrun.<p>Also in regards to inflation, it should be remembered that Carter was a fiscal conservative trying to reign in spending, but his own party faught him on this. It&#x27;s why Ted Kennedy primaried him in the 1980 Democratic primaries: he considered Carter to be too much of a tightwad.</div><br/><div id="39787259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39787259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wombatpm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39784568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39787259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39787259">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thermostat lowering wasn’t mandated, but there was a big push with public service announcement ads about turning it down and wearing a sweater</div><br/><div id="39787469" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39787469" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">UncleOxidant</span><span>|</span><a href="#39784568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39787259">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39787469">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39787469">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, and fireside chats with Carter wearing a cardigan sweater next to a fireplace.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39786687" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39786687" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mistrial9</span><span>|</span><a href="#39784568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39785837">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786219">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786050">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39786687">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39786687">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">the political environment was deeply reeling from the Oil Shock embargoes and OPEC.

As the article puts it:<p>&gt; &quot;There are a lot of climate crisis stories in modern sci fi, but a great many of them focus, intentionally or not, on the natural world’s utility to humans: we must preserve it or else we doom ourselves. Silent Running argues that we should preserve the natural world even if we can live without it, even if it serves no purpose in feeding the hungry or curing the ill, even if we can find a way to get along just fine.&quot;<p>If the idea of the importance of preservation of the natural world were much more widespread, humanity would be in a very different situation now. Dern&#x27;s character&#x27;s argument in the movie is just as relevant today, and the general answer today remains the same: the natural world is a secondary concern compared to humanity&#x27;s unconstrained and unthinking growth.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39785772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39785772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sniffnoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#39786764">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39785772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39785772">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So why is it called &quot;Silent Running&quot;?</div><br/><div id="39786645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39786645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rootbear</span><span>|</span><a href="#39785772">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39786041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39786645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39786645">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The title refers to the idea of a submarine going silent so it can&#x27;t be tracked by sonar.

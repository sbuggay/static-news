I appreciate your perspective, but I&#x27;d like to clarify a few points regarding Madhava&#x27;s contributions to calculus. While it&#x27;s true that Madhava and his school may not have created a unifying framework like Newton and Leibniz did, their work laid crucial groundwork for what we now consider calculus. Madhava is credited with developing infinite series for trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine, which are equivalent to the Taylor series we use today. 
For example, his series for sin(x) and cos(x) predate those discovered in Europe by over 200 years[1][2].<p>His followers, like Jyeṣṭhadeva, further elaborated on these concepts in texts like the Yuktibhāṣā, providing proofs and demonstrating their applications[3][5]. Moreover, Madhava&#x27;s methods for approximating pi were remarkably accurate, achieving values correct to 11 decimal places, showcasing his advanced understanding of numerical analysis[2][4].<p>This indicates that he was indeed engaging with concepts foundational to calculus, such as limits and convergence. Thus, while Madhava&#x27;s work may not fit neatly into the modern definition of calculus, it represents a significant and sophisticated mathematical tradition that deserves recognition as a precursor to later developments in the field.<p>While we are on this topic, we can stop for a second and ponder on why the ancient Indians needed these mathematical formulation. The answer is astronomy, and thus needing a language&#x2F;framework to understand the cosmos, i.e. mathematics.<p>Additionally, I wanted to share some interesting insights about the Jesuit transmission of both calculus and the Gregorian calendar from Kerala to Europe. The Jesuit missionaries were not only spreading Christianity through their work, but they were scholars in their own right and could see the value of the advance mathematics they encountered by the Kerala (India) school of mathematics by madhava and the advanced calendar, more accurate than the julian calendar used in Europe at the time.<p>Jesuit missionaries, especially Matteo Ricci, were really fascinated by the advanced mathematical knowledge coming from the Kerala school. They connected with local scholars, like Brahmins and Kshatriyas, to learn about their mathematical concepts, including those found in texts like the <i>Yuktibhāṣā</i> and <i>Tantrasangraha</i> [5]. This collaboration was part of the Jesuits&#x27; efforts to understand local cultures and improve their missionary work. It’s fascinating to think that this exchange not only contributed to the Gregorian calendar reform in 1582 but also helped introduce key calculus concepts into European mathematics.<p>As to why this is not common knowledge, it’s partly the British colonial policies that muddied the waters and&#x2F;or suppressed the source of information. But If one looks at it with time, the evidence is there<p>Citations:

My oversimplified summary has been,
India has had 3 major golden ages in its history.<p>The earliest was during the Mauryan Period. This is the age Dalrymple is talking about, the time of Aryabhatta, the popularization of Buddhism, arguably the time when most of the Indian epics were written (dating them has become notoriously political to the point that discerning the truth is hard now). This is the age Indian nationalists stress on, and the left wing tries to ignore. This age declines because the empire got too big, lost control and slowly disintegrated.<p>The second age was during the Islamic golden age for India which the right tries to ignore and left stress on. My general sense is that there was a golden age of architecture, poetry and arts and probably not so much in Science. The Taj Mahal for instance was built during this time. This age declined mostly due to wars, the Mughal rulers were never successful in fully unifying India, even to the extent the Mauryans did. They fought consistent wars against pockets of resistance in the South, and towards the end began losing these wildly expensive wars (leading to a brief reign by Shivaji)<p>The third golden age which no one wants to admit (left or right) is the British Golden age. There really was a renaissance in Indian thought in arts, science during British rule. This was when Indian history was “rediscovered”, first by British orientalists and then by mostly Indian Bengalis. CV Raman won the Nobel prize in science, Tagore won the Nobel prize in literature, Ramanujan etc, the names are numerous. The British rule also was the largest and most stable unification of India till the modern times. After 1850s there were almost no pockets of military resistance against the British rule. The British age declined with WW1 and WW2, and ended with Indian independence.<p>Post independence was not a smooth going party. If you came to India during 1980s, you could argue independence had been a disaster with everything getting worse post independence. But since 1990s economic liberalization India has a new ish golden age with unique characteristics. Who knows how long this will continue and when it will inevitably end</div><br/><div id="41515797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41515797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514468">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41515797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41515797">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think British India can be described as a Golden Age, when it was arguably the biggest transfer of wealth in history.

This is a very dishonest way to obscure the actual facts.<p>Direct rule from Britain lasted for almost 90 years: 1858 to 1947. Even by your numbers then, that&#x27;s 190 years: longer than the Mauryan empire&#x27;s whole lifespan, and much closer to that of the Mughals. From there the question remains whether it&#x27;s the longest &quot;unification&quot;, and this mostly comes down to exactly when each of the aforementioned empires could be considered to have &quot;unified&quot; India.<p>By any definition the Mughals united the subcontinent by 1707AD at the latest: but by 1751, less than fifty years on, their effective domain had declined to a few pockets in Rajputana and Bengal.<p>The Guptan Empire on the other hand, while certainly a key predecessor to later Indian states and a major unifying force in the northern half of the subcontinent, never conquered the southern half -- what is today Karnakata, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu never entered their control. The closest they got was ~420AD after the south-eastern conquests of Chandragupta II, but again within fifty years they again lost control of today&#x27;s Orissa, and even lost large swathes of north+western India to invasions from the steppe.<p>You call GP&#x27;s post &quot;a lazy opinion backed by little research&quot;, but when you dig into the facts I can&#x27;t see how you could argue that his claim is incorrect. The British Raj alone seems to qualify as the longest-lasting unification of India before the modern Indian state, and if you include any part of the EIC&#x27;s rule then it&#x27;s indisputably so.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41516309" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41516309" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">selimthegrim</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514468">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515242">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515990">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41516309">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41516309">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;arts-and-culture&#x2F;literature&#x2F;india-never-had-a-golden-age&#x2F;article23968771.ece&#x2F;amp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;arts-and-culture&#x2F;literature&#x2F;i...</a></div><br/><div id="41517440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41517440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rramadass</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514468">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41516309">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41517440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41517440">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The man was a card-carrying Marxist member of CPI with his own agenda and hence all of his &quot;scholarship&quot;

Julius Caesar is one such example that comes to mind.<p>But I feel that approach sometimes discounts what the country and its people could have achieved on their own if they were not invaded. For example, the Taj Mahal is just one building in India. There are lots of other structures that exist that were not built under rule from outside invaders, but they never get attention (at least I’ve not heard of them). With Britain - you mentioned that they unified India and brought stability but how true is that if you compare it to the period of India much earlier? India was rocked by Islamic invasions (which led to the Mughal period) and colonized by those Islamic rulers for hundreds of years. That’s what the European colonizers took over. Is that really a fair period to compare against? India basically spent a millennium ruled by one outside genocidal invader or the other. I am guessing the period before that was more peaceful and not in need of some outside unifying force to feel ‘stable’.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41518846" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41518846" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gsky</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514468">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41515409">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41513591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41518846">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41518846">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If Invasions and colonization were golden age we should continue that tradition throughout the world. &#x2F;s</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41513591" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41513591" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vjust</span><span>|</span><a href="#41514468">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41517320">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41513591">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41513591">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess the author, a historian, writes about ancient Indian mathematical contributions (a science of which he has no expertise presumably).  These historical references I have learnt in various mathematical texts (the story of Fibonacci and al khwarizmi) - the journey across multiple centuries, of these innovations made by Aryabhata or Brahmagupta.<p>As an Indian, and as a math aficionado (and degree holder) - I wonder, that was about 1500 years ago. In that era, a discovery (as you can read it) took 500 years to move from Arabia to Europe, thanks to Fibonacci&#x27;s writing.   Contrast it to today&#x27;s instant dissemination of information and breakthroughs. Yes those were the glory days of Indian civilization. We have a Ramanujan every 100 years in India. Breakthrough ideas (earthshaking ones like the concept of 0) emerging out of India are few and far between. Around 1000 years ago, the fountain of (world-changing) creativity and ideas seems to have dried up, as far as India is concerned. Maybe it was the invaders , easy to blame everything on outsiders, though - what is India today was 600 or 400 odd kingdoms, frequently warring each other - so turmoil was always there.  And if you were a reclusive monk in a forest with a bunch of students, no Brit or Mughal dude was stopping you from innovating.  So, the big question is - can we explain why genius ideas stopped (without blaming British, or Mughals etc) - because thanks to Indian&#x27;s instincts, the first step is to blame the Brits&#x2F;Mughals , so problem solved, proved, ostrich is happy in the sand.<p>I can only indulge in thought exercises , like : Aryabhata and Brahmagupta didn&#x27;t have computers, didn&#x27;t even have pencil and paper. They just sat there and thought. For months, or years. Or maybe they were walking. And gazed at the stars and observed and observed. And most likely, and importantly debated orally  : endlessly with their teachers (in a monastery type place class sizes were small), peers- I believe this was a time in India&#x27;s cultural history when debating, and disagreeing were positive things.  In modern India, intellectualism has taken a back seat. To disagree is to be unpatriotic even.  (Nalanda University comes to mind <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nalanda_mahavihara" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nalanda_mahavihara</a> - not its modernized recreation which is likely going to be hardly attempting to break the mold). WhatsApp - the destroyer of brain cells by atrophy , has a grip on every mind.<p>We read about the great Greek debates. We see videos of Tibetan buddhist monks practice debating in a monastery.  Surely this kind of debating, face-to-face is missing in today&#x27;s world (without getting angry) - this is the equivalent of the modern cafe in Paris or Vienna, with Godel and co. debating . This debating society , was Nalanda back a thousand years until invaders burnt every manuscript down and slaughtered every monk almost - except the manuscripts the Chinese monks took back to the Emperor in China - they are the only written records of life that remain, that and some arabic ones.<p>Yet I hope new lotuses will bloom from India - we can never predict where the next genius or breakthrough idea will emerge from - why not Africa?</div><br/><div id="41517038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41517038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ar-Curunir</span><span>|</span><a href="#41513591">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41514399">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41517038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41517038">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The fact that checking primality has a deterministic algorithm is a recent Indian breakthrough.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41514399" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41514399" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">renewiltord</span><span>|</span><a href="#41513591">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41517038">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41513640">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41514399">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41514399">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it&#x27;s just that industrialization, the computer, and the Internet were such massive juice that even if you have a brilliant mind it doesn&#x27;t matter because the guy with that tool can take anything you think of and make it better.

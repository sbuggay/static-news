In some sort of crazy black swan event, a public offering of stock&#x2F;equity would easily bring in vast sums for them. They even managed to get through COVID unscathed. The main danger of relying on a single provider is them taking advantage of that position and charging unreasonable rates, exactly like Boeing&#x2F;Lockheed have been doing for decades (two companies, exact same issues - go figure). But SpaceX is ideologically motivated and minimizing the costs of spaceflight, as they have now been doing for decades, is a fundamental part of their goal. To use an obvious example, we didn&#x27;t build out two identical Apollo programs.<p>Space is orders of magnitude more complex than air flight, and Boeing is now left struggling even with the latter. China has a highly advanced space program and have successfully launched&#x2F;manned their own space station, and much more. Yet even they are technologically far behind SpaceX - the same is true of Russia. I don&#x27;t actually understand why this is, as it&#x27;s not like SpaceX is relying on any sort of just extremely well guarded secrets, but whatever the reason, it is what it is. And so with this context, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any realistic chance of Boeing &quot;getting its act together&quot; anytime in the foreseeable future. So it turns these gestures into little more than lighting tens of billions of dollars on fire.

I&#x27;d actually go one step further and say that they <i>will</i> eventually lose a crew of astronauts. Perhaps to the ISS, but most definitely to Mars. The Falcon is the most reliable rocket ever made with some 335 successes for 2 failures contrasted against e.g. 133 and 2 for the Space Shuttle, but that failure rate is still extremely high relative to something like an airplane. And the overwhelming majority of all space flights are for &quot;simple&quot; repetitive tasks. As we increase the number of manned missions, as well as their complexity - the eventual loss of crewed missions is an absolute certainty. Something like 3% of all astronauts have died &#x27;on the job&#x27; making it likely the single most dangerous profession in existence. Space remains extremely complex and dangerous, and it&#x27;s likely to only become even more so in the decades to come as we increase the complexity of tasks carried out.<p>The reason NASA&#x27;s failures were such a huge deal is because they shouldn&#x27;t have happened. In both cases you had issues with the managerial layer ignoring the engineering layer, and moving ahead in high risk scenarios - that was particularly stupid in Challenger, where they also had a high profile civilian aboard. In SpaceX the managerial layer and the technical layer are largely the same thing, and they also have a system where any flight engineer can independently cancel a flight, for any reason, at his own discretion. So the chances of a flight moving forward with a predictable risk is quite low. So what will most likely happen when they lose a crewed flight is an investigation to ensure it was not caused by systemic errors, some effort to ensure that whatever did happen does not happen again, and then a return to flight.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40283214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40283214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ringz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40281887">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40282683">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40283083">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40282762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40283214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40283214">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This will certainly happen, just as it has already happened to the Russians and the Americans (several times).

First and biggest one is by being a private company operating on its own budget authority. Basically, SpaceX was free to work in whatever way they wanted - a 180° turn from &quot;established&quot; practice both at NASA and ESA and the political decision makers that the billions of dollars of expenses had to be distributed across the continent fairly to help politicians get reelected. That means instead of dealing with shit tons of suppliers, wasting insane amounts of money on tenders, specification documents and whatnot, SpaceX went in-house for as much as they could, in very very few locations on top of that to save on shipping.<p>The second one is ossification. Boeing, Airbus, EADS, the major carmakers - they all got big by perfecting (sometimes centuries) old designs by iteration: airframes, cars, combustion engines, rockets, you name it. Straying from the beaten path comes with very high internal risk for anyone involved, and so very little true innovation happens. SpaceX in contrast operated on a green field - a ton of money and a general attitude of &quot;you&#x27;re free to do whatever the fuck you want, and failures are expected along the path&quot;.<p>Eventually, no doubt there, SpaceX and Tesla will both ossify as well, it&#x27;s a trap for any large organization - and we&#x27;re seeing signs with Tesla already, with attention going to the Cybertruck instead of getting the issues with existing models (e.g. fabrication tolerances, spare part availability) under control first.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40281886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40281886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nolongerthere</span><span>|</span><a href="#40281850">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40283386">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40283082">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40281886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40281886">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Likely sunk cost fallacy.

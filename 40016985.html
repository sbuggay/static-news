Often those staff are blindly following hardening guides or asking for every configuration switch to be flipped to &quot;most secure&quot; setting without having a good understanding of the threat model for the workload and without taking into account the tradeoffs between utility and operational cost. The level of advice can be on par with ChatGPT or worse, but it is taken more seriously due to the advice-giver&#x27;s job title.<p>Security teams often have no &quot;skin in the game&quot;. There are no real disincentives to stop them from asking for crazy or very expensive things and imposing high costs on other teams. In fact they are incentivised to <i>do that very thing</i>, because the only thing that covers your butt more than recommending everything possible, is recommending everything possible PLUS some things that can&#x27;t be done with the time &amp; budget available, leaving them able to say &quot;we see you had $security_problem, well, we recommended $impossible_thing but you didn&#x27;t do it&quot; (e.g. say, $500k of DLP solution [with its own operational risks!] for a workload that only makes $1M a year). To be fair I&#x27;ve seen some good &amp; practical security teams but once you get a bad actor &#x2F; games player at management level that behaviour can become very sticky.<p>I have seen variants of this nearly everywhere I&#x27;ve worked, it seems very hard to get incentives aligned between the do-ers and the secure-ers.<p>The most practical workaround I&#x27;ve seen is to make sure there is a reasonable balance of political power between the various parties.<p>&quot;Reasonable&quot; can be hard to establish but is context dependent.

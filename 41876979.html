Human beings exist embedded in society, and to handwave that away in favor of “perspectives” just results in you adopting a different narrative, the “I reject narratives” one. Which is ultimately why existentialism never really went anywhere.<p>Instead I think the problem is actually the exact opposite: people don’t embrace stories enough. Modernity is accurately described as a place without any coherent sort of arch-story for society and local-story for individuals and places. To use the concept by Deleuze, everything has been too “deterritorialized.” We’d all probably be happier with a solid narrative underlying our senses of self and society.</div><br/><div id="41877307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41877307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">corimaith</span><span>|</span><a href="#41877129">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41877307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41877307">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Humans desire narratives to understand the world, but the world is too complex to be captured into reality.<p>Those arch-theories already exist in the theories like Dialectical Materialism, or worse, Fascism, and with terrible consequences once they confronted reality.<p>The circumstantial perspective of (Liberal Western) Modernism &amp; Postmodernism may have it&#x27;s flaws, but it has offered more practical results in policymaking than not.</div><br/><div id="41877344" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41877344" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keiferski</span><span>|</span><a href="#41877129">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41877344">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41877344">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d describe those things (along with most traditional worldviews) as failed attempts to encapsulate reality into an over simplified story.

No no no.<p>You want things to be wrapped up neatly
The way that stories do.<p>You’re looking for answers
But answers aren’t looking for you.<p>Because life is a gradual series of revelations
That occur over a period of time
It’s not some carefully crafted story
It’s a mess and we’re all gonna die.<p>If you saw a movie that was like real life
You’d be like “what the hell was that movie about?”
It was really all over the place
Life doesn’t make narrative sense.<p>Nuhuh<p>We tell ourselves that we’re in a movie.
Whoa whoa whoa
Each one of us thinks we got the starring role.
Role role role.<p>But the truth is sometimes you’re the lead
And sometimes you’re an extra
Just walking by in the background

That occur over a period of time
Some things might happen that seem connected
But there’s not always a reason or rhyme<p>People aren’t characters
They’re complicated

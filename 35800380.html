Giving more proper definitions helps: With real-time I mean that audio (or a MIDI event) can enter the system and, with a low latency in the order of 20ms, a sound can be produced. With high-quality I mean that it is capable to generate 16bit samples at 44.1kHz (CD-quality, at the level of human hearing).

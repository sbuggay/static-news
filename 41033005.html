She was a stay-at-home mom with 2 kids, her husband commit suicide after serving in Iraq and then being pushed out of the military (this was the 90s when the US military was actively drawing down). She basically said that the current welfare system (in the 90s, in California) didn&#x27;t allow a way to slowly move off welfare. She said she had many offers for part-time work, and work that didn&#x27;t earn a lot of money, but both had potential for her to eventually be promoted to full-time or to make more money than welfare paid her. But she said there was no way to do this: welfare was either all or nothing. But most of all, she dispelled the myth that she was some sort of leech that didn&#x27;t want to work. She wanted to work, but the welfare system didn&#x27;t allow it.<p>Your comment didn&#x27;t necessarily imply it, but a lot of the discourse these days tries to imply (or directly claims) that recipients are the problem, they&#x27;re a bunch of lazy bums that don&#x27;t want to contribute.

Stop using a complicated progressive rate structure, and instead eliminate the phase out entirely. Now instead of low income people having a nominal 0% tax rate but an effective 50% benefits phase out rate and high income people having a nominal 30% tax rate, you just use a flat 35% tax rate which implicitly has the benefits phase out built into the tax system. Which means you don&#x27;t need any of this income reporting or annual tax returns or anything of the kind, the employer&#x2F;seller just withholds the fixed tax rate and you&#x27;re done, and everybody unconditionally gets the UBI to provide the effect of a progressive rate structure.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41039834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41039834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jewayne</span><span>|</span><a href="#41037718">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41039677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41042398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41041370">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41039834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41039834">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>In light of this study, it seems to me that a cash-support system that wants to encourage work should have a starting region with a negative effective phase-out rate: &quot;for every $1 you make up to $X, you get $0.25 more from UBI&#x2F;Welfare.&quot; That would encourage labour-market attachment even if tenuous, and it would also have a side benefit of making the worker want to report the income, possibly uncovering under-the-table payment schemes.</i><p>Nobody tell this guy about the Earned Income Tax Credit.

With a UBI you replace the benefits with cash payments and eliminate the phase outs, but also flatten the tax rates so the poor are paying the <i>same</i> effective marginal rates as the rich, instead of higher ones.<p>The result would be that the poor pay slightly lower effective marginal rates and the rich pay slightly higher ones (although you don&#x27;t even inherently have to do that; it depends entirely on the tax rate and the amount of the UBI), but the overall system is much <i>simpler</i>. And the consequence that the poor are paying <i>higher</i> effective marginal rates than the rich, which was presumably never intended, goes away.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41042338" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41042338" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">patmcc</span><span>|</span><a href="#41037718">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41041918">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41042451">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41042223">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41042338">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41042338">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;d adjust marginal rates so the poor would (net) benefit, the middle class would about break even, and the rich would pay more.

Social security would probably be unaffected, at least initially, and SSI&#x2F;disability would likely either be reduced or gradually phased out, depending on the amounts.<p>I know the other various benefits aren&#x27;t huge in the budget, but they add significant bureaucratic burden to both the state and the individual.

In this way, as work income increases in a negative income tax system, the benefits will incrementally decrease, until the individual meets the level where they become a net payer, not receiver, but those that are net payers will not have a total income less than any of those that are net receivers.<p>In the system that was described it would take two units of income to decrease one unit of benefits, allowing total income to increase with an increase in levels of work income, while not having a hard cutoff for benefits.

When you have a high paying job, you can retire early and still maintain your desired standard of living (and most people do, because most people don&#x27;t enjoy their job and that is why we call it work). So a pretty uninspiring job like plumbing would end up paying a very high salary. Or stressful jobs like nurse or doctor. What happens when people doing these critical and now highly paid jobs retire to their yachts at 40? Will the market balance things, and did enough apprentice plumbers get trained to take over? Or will things spiral out of control and collapse? And how does the extremely high wages of critical jobs affect the level of UBI? If it is set to meet minimum essentials, then the UBI too can spiral up as the cost of those essentials such as the plumbers wage goes up. I tend to think that without a lot more automation, then a UBI cannot cover the minimum essentials&#x2F;poverty line, because of the large amount of work required to support society that is only done because people are forced to do it, to the point that we cannot sustain bribing people to do it.

For most goods, it is conventionally understood that inefficiency of the profit signal is less than the inefficiency of political process.<p>By way of analogy, Walmart has a 2% profit margin which is a cost consumers bear for Walmart curating the selection of goods they want in the quantities they want. In terms of efficiency, I think it is unlikely a panel of government politicians (with their own motives and biases) could run a store and decide on the types and quantity of goods that people will want in a more efficient way.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41038999" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41038999" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brigadier132</span><span>|</span><a href="#41037718">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41038689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41038844">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41039859">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41038999">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41038999">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People dont want to work but they want the benefits of other peoples labor.

Look at the pandemic stimulus worldwide, and the inflation since.<p>If a lot of people had more money on hand, they would: 1) want to spend it; 2) prefer to work less (on average) so they have more time to enjoy spending it. Both of those lead to inflationary pressure, so it&#x27;s unlikely $1000 in the new system would get you anything near what you currently get with it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41038495" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41038495" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bryanlarsen</span><span>|</span><a href="#41037718">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41042663">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41037822">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41038495">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41038495">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But significantly more than $1000 is not financially feasible for a balanced UBI program.   The average US taxpayer has $40,000 of income and pays $6000 in taxes.   A balanced UBI program would increase the average taxpayers taxes by an amount equal to the UBI.   So the $40,000 of income would increase to $52,000 and taxes would increase from $6000 to $18000.    It works out to about 15% increase in tax levels.<p>Yes, we&#x27;d try and reduce that income tax increase by getting money elsewhere, most significantly because UBI should allow us to decrease welfare payments significantly.   But that would still contribute well under half of the $12K.<p>The numbers work at $1k a month, but they don&#x27;t work for levels significantly higher than that.<p>And if UBI isn&#x27;t balanced, then it will affect inflation, making it much less impactful.<p>I believe that $1k&#x2F;month is a good figure for UBI.

Generally when people get more money for some reason the people who they buy from don&#x27;t know it - but in this case they would know it! It would be foolish to ignore it.<p>I don&#x27;t have a pat answer to your concerns, but I also want you to think about what stops your landlord from raising your rent by $1000 &#x2F; month right now. Like, why not just go for it? Unless there&#x27;s rent control it&#x27;s allowed. The classic &quot;efficient markets&quot; answer is that providing housing does have underlying costs and, though people having more money does tend to lead prices to go up, sellers are still competing for buyers. At least historically, even in boom economic times, housing costs did not 100% stay even with rising incomes (which is just what this is).<p>That said, us housing has been getting worse for most people for a long time. House costs have outpaced inflation for 60 years[1]. Rents are even worse[2]. Reporting suggests this is now being made worse by highly concentrated rental conglomerates[3]. That is to say that the cost of these services is not tied to how much money people have to pay for them - your scenario where landlords just raise prices to new income levels is actually optimistic. There&#x27;s also practical evidence that local factors and competition will lead prices to go down under &quot;the right&quot; local conditions[4].<p>So I think my answer is that your concern is based on an idealized economic model, but the actual trends US in housing haven&#x27;t really been following the economic ideal for some time. I don&#x27;t think all gains from UBI would be snapped up by raising prices, but like all inflation we&#x27;d lose some! Overall, to me, the weakness here is that the study doesn&#x27;t show that many benefits for a ~40% (!!) increase in income. Which seems WILD. Just not what you would expect at all.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;why-home-prices-have-risen-faster-than-inflation-since-the-1960s.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;why-home-prices-have-risen-f...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realestatewitch.com&#x2F;rent-to-income-ratio-2022&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realestatewitch.com&#x2F;rent-to-income-ratio-2022&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accountable.us&#x2F;watchdog-major-landlord-companies-continue-to-price-gouge-despite-through-the-roof-profits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accountable.us&#x2F;watchdog-major-landlord-companies-con...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfist.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;report-sf-rents-still-coming-down-despite-rents-going-up-pretty-much-everywhere-else-nationwide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfist.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;report-sf-rents-still-coming-do...</a></div><br/><div id="41040728" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41040728" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">superfrank</span><span>|</span><a href="#41037601">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41039730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41037904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41040728">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41040728">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I also want you to think about what stops your landlord from raising your rent by $1000 &#x2F; month right now. Like, why not just go for it?<p>Answering as a landlord (I have one property I used to live in that I rent out), the reason I don&#x27;t just keep raising rent is mainly because I like my tenant and want to be fair to them. Having had bad tenants in the past, a good tenant is worth their weight in gold.<p>More relevant to your question though, the other reason is because I know there&#x27;s a ceiling after a certain point where the number of people who have the money to rent my property starts to shrink and the time it would take to find a new tenant would cost more than the amount of money I would make by raising rent.<p>If rent is $2000&#x2F;mo and raising it by $100&#x2F;mo means it&#x27;s going to take an extra month to find a tenant, then I need to believe that that tenant is going to stay for at least 20 months to break even.<p>If everyone all of a sudden has an extra $1000&#x2F;mo I could be fairly certain that my tenant won&#x27;t be priced out if I were to raise rent a few hundred dollars.</div><br/><div id="41041053" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41041053" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aeturnum</span><span>|</span><a href="#41037601">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41040728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41037904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41041053">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41041053">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks - I hadn&#x27;t thought to mention the risk of trying to raise rent but it&#x27;s a good note.

It&#x27;s better to have a tenant who you get along with and who cooperates with how you want to rent a place. It&#x27;s nice not to fight with your landlord. There&#x27;s some economic value there too, but it&#x27;s hard to quantify. I&#x27;m kind of interested in housing interventions that ban large companies from holding too many units of housing. It mostly &quot;puts a ceiling&quot; on how much profit one company can derive from many rental units, but actually I&#x27;m not sure I care - and trying to maximize the human connection between the person who owns the building and the people who live in it seems sensible.<p>[1] To be fair, when push does come to shove, a reason to under-rate them is the landlord looses some months of rent while the tenant becomes homeless.

Student loans and mortgages are the only two times that most consumers access huge lines of credit on very good terms. But unlike mortgages (which are already prone to creating the occasional credit crisis), student loans donât assess the value of the âassetâ theyâre underwriting. You canât get a $100,000 mortgage on a house thatâs only worth $50,000, but you can get a $100,000 student loan on a degree thatâs worth exactly $0 in potential future earnings.

We gather detailed survey data, administrative records, and data from a custom mobile phone app. The transfer caused total individual income to fall by about $1,500&#x2F;year relative to the control group, excluding the transfers. The program resulted in a 2.0 percentage point decrease in labor market participation for participants and a 1.3-1.4 hour per week reduction in labor hours, with participantsâ partners reducing their hours worked by a comparable amount. The transfer generated the largest increases in time spent on leisure, as well as smaller increases in time spent in other activities such as transportation and finances. Despite asking detailed questions about amenities, we find no impact on quality of employment, and our confidence intervals can rule out even small improvements. We observe no significant effects on investments in human capital, though younger participants may pursue more formal education. Overall, our results suggest a moderate labor supply effect that does not appear offset by other productive activities.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;Afinetheorem&#x2F;status&#x2F;1815413121822896270" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;Afinetheorem&#x2F;status&#x2F;1815413121822896270</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openresearchlab.org&#x2F;findings&#x2F;nber-working-paper-employment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openresearchlab.org&#x2F;findings&#x2F;nber-working-paper-...</a></div><br/><div id="41040923" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41040923" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kbelder</span><span>|</span><a href="#41036971">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41038983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41040923">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41040923">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think UBI is a horrifically bad idea.

Anyone with a modest income or larger will likely either see no changes to their net income or even a reduction in net income (due to higher taxes to pay for the program).<p>- Assuming a UBI of $1k (just making a number up, but it gets tossed around a lot), you would only get that full amount if you were unemployed, so that means you are pulling in $12k a year. Someone making $12k a year isn&#x27;t really going to be renting an apartment by themselves. They are probably going to crash on a couch, live with relatives, or maybe rent a single room.<p>- As you go higher up the income ladder, the UBI phases out. I am also just making up numbers here, but maybe the phase out starts when you make $1k&#x2F;month and stops at $3k&#x2F;month. So someone making $12k a year in income would actually get $24k&#x2F;year with UBI, but by the time you are making $36k&#x2F;year you get $0 UBI. There are not a lot of areas in the country where you can rent apartments on these incomes. The places where you can do that, housing is probably not in as much demand and will likely not suffer from much if any inflation. So again, even if you are making a small income and bringing in some UBI, it will be designed to phase out long before someone could afford a one bedroom apartment in a high demand area.<p>- And I think a nice feature of this type of program, is UBI would actually help even out the demand imbalances between VHCOL and LCOL areas. No one living solely off UBI is going to be comfortable in SF or NYC. But there are a lot of regions in our country that have minimal job prospects and could desperately use some revitalization. UBI would go a lot farther in those areas and would create some monetary inflows back into those regions. That in turn could reduce some of the housing pressure on the VHCOL areas (although I am not sure it would be a huge effect).<p>It is worth mentioning that I assume most proponents of UBI are also acutely aware of the housing crises. To solve that, we need to build more housing. For the reasons listed above, I don&#x27;t think UBI would cause much housing inflation, but even if it did, the solution to that problem is to build more housing, not to forgo welfare programs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41041496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41041496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mucle6</span><span>|</span><a href="#41038983">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41041241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043326">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41043545">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41041496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41041496">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree, in my opinion, a common misconception I&#x27;ve seen is people saying wealth isn&#x27;t zero sum.

We have a winner. It also really matters which people get the money. For example: we printed gazillions of dollars after the 2008 financial crisis, but &quot;inflation&quot; was super low that whole time. What happened? We gave that money to banks and owners of financial assets, so the stuff that they buy more than others was what got inflated aka houses and startup equity (yes, your startup equity!) and the stock market and yachts and stuff. In 2020 we gave a bunch of money either directly to every individual or to their bosses to give to them, so a different set of things got inflated. What do wage workers buy more of with their money? Groceries et al. Home rental prices are through the roof, but home purchase prices are not. My guess is we see home price deflation (or at least lower-than-otherwise inflation) unless interest rates start getting cut again, which they will probably do because the people that get to influence and make that decision all benefit financially or politically from cutting those rates, but I digress.<p>So my (old, bachelors) degree in econ gives me a story that makes sense, but surely a more recent or grad-level or professional economist can probably point out all the ways I&#x27;m deluded.

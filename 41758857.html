Some of the events have as much twists and turns as a childish cartoon show. I can understand people killing for revenge but someone finding reason for revenge because a toddler took a piece of meat to eat and that led to a dead dog just seems so insane to me. Insane because these same people are capable of hunting, socializing and crafting stuff which definetely require intelligence. Yet the leaps of logic and reason they make to put the blame on someone to exact revenge on are enormous.

I think such high-ranking men are probably not representative of the typical Yanomamo man. Rising to the top of such groups likely requires a good deal of psychopathy. A measure of charm, but also a reputation for intolerance of sleights, volatility, and gratuitous violence. The article also explains that she didn&#x27;t accept any husband except the two men that explicitly threatened to kill her if she refused--so in a sense she was indirectly selecting for this type of man.<p>An interesting read on this topic is the very book being dissed in the article--Napoleon Chagnon&#x27;s &quot;Noble Savages&quot;. According to this article, Chagnon met the Yanomamo in a state more exposed to our civilization, but even then many of the high-ranking men come across exactly as I described above: charming when they want, but volatile and gratuitously violent. Two episodes from the book stand out in my memory.<p>- A chief encounters two young men from a rival clan. They are nervous because of this man&#x27;s reputation, but he calls out to them and offers them food, charms them and puts them at ease. Then he walks behind them and kills them. In his opinion, this is hilarious.<p>- A man suddenly believes his wife has cheated on him. He drags her out by her hair, punches and kicks her head repeatedly. Chagnon is aghast and almost intervenes. I don&#x27;t recall whether the woman survives.</div><br/><div id="41775037" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41775037" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fxtentacle</span><span>|</span><a href="#41772306">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41773004">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41773364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41775037">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41775037">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also believe that in a sense she was indirectly selecting for this type of man.

I can say that my children have learned all sorts of things they would have never learned without technology. I honestly think it more has to do with what they are pushed to do on said technology. Yes your kid watching 8 hours of prank videos is stupid. But I make mine watch things like how to draw and they draw along with it, they have improved so much as artists. I have loaded up videos on how to do certain math that I had forgotten over the years and they are able to see someone explain how to go through the steps. With out that they would be stuck waiting on the teacher and the limited time between all students.<p>Even something like obd2 readers is tech honestly. The other day I took my 8 year old out to my car as it was not running right. I showed him how to use the reader. Then showed that my car had a p0304 code. I told him that is a misfire cylinder 4. Then showed him how to open hood and where my coils are and how the car had 4 cylinders. Then explained why cars misfire and that often it can just be the coils so test those first. Explained how we could swap coil 3 and 4 and check the code again. We did that and when I plugged reader back in the code was now p0303. My kid immediately yelled the coil is bad! Because he knew that since the code moved when we moved the coil that is the problem. 
All that said I do think yes tech can absolutely be used to improve learning in some situations. The obd2 reader is a bit basic yes but if we had AR I can think of dozens or hundreds of applications we could make from it. If I could afford it I would use it with my kids.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41893423" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893423" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmpdev</span><span>|</span><a href="#41892977">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893017">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893428">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893423">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893423">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Certain sports also lend themselves incredibly well to it<p>Motorsport simulations and golf come to mind<p>Not just for leisure but a serious aspect of professional practice<p>Visually reinforcing the difference between a 0.1 second window for motorsport, or thumb sized threshold for a golf chip or putt, for example.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41893428" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893428" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PeterStuer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41892977">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893423">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41893347">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893428">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893428">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve not had a qualified technicoan pull out a manual ot diagram to fix an appliance even tough this scenario of AR for this usecase was one of the OGs in the 80s.<p>I once had to learn to juggle for a stage play.

Yes, there were missing features and shortcomings, but many&#x2F;most of those missing features were obvious, and it was actually pretty delightful that with every new software update I&#x27;d cross some of those missing features off the list.<p>None of that dynamic exists with the Apple Vision Pro.

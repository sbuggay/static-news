I actually did my Ph. D. in software engineering after getting my computer science master degree a bit over 20 years ago. Software engineering as a discipline is a bit of an oddball science as it is a bit stuck between typical hard &#x2F; math driven scientific fields like mathematics and physics and other scientific fields like sociological, economics, etc. The core issue is that software engineering involves people and processes. Mathematical proofs don&#x27;t really work all that well for that kind of stuff and you need to reach for scientific methodology from other fields to study it properly.<p>A lot of computer scientists actually struggle with this and don&#x27;t fully get it. As a result, software engineering education isn&#x27;t all that great in a typical computer science curriculum. One reason is that most computer scientists actually lack the experience of having worked in large software companies and don&#x27;t actually know a lot about how that works. It&#x27;s something I realized while doing my Ph. D. in this area and I fixed it by leaving academia. I learned a lot since then.<p>One thing I learned is that a lot of good software engineers exist that never studied computer science. I know people with physics, geology, micro biology, philosophy degrees that ended up working as software engineers and that are very good at what they do. Most scientific work involves some level of programming these days. So, it&#x27;s quite common to meet people with some python or even machine learning experience that never studied computer science. Things like formal methods, linear algebra, etc. are useful to know of course for some things. But you don&#x27;t need to have a any of that to learn python, javascript, or any of the other popular languages. In the same way, knowing a lot about type systems is nice if you build compilers or design your own languages. But you don&#x27;t need to know much about that to use a language.</div><br/><div id="36734763" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36734763" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">frankreyes</span><span>|</span><a href="#36732561">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732746">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36734582">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36734763">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36734763">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; and don&#x27;t actually know a lot about how that works.

(And to be fair, often the greater picture our software serves to achieve is of dubious value.) It is not really like many other jobs, of which you could explain roughly to the next person on the street how the job is done. Before for example a software engineer gets to explain how some code they wrote works, the other person has long zoomed out. And before one gets to explain that it is a craft and what the art about it is, most people have fled. Not many are willing to listen to what fascinates a &quot;nerd&quot;.<p>With that lack of understanding often come tendencies to wanting to associate with other people, rather than that person, whose job one does not even understand.

And the fact that most bridges don&#x27;t actually collapse is not mainly due to the ingenuity of the engineer that built it, but rather, allowing liberal margins of errors for safety. If you use materials twice as strong as the minimum requirement, things don&#x27;t break if you made a 50% error in your calculations.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d be very concerned if &quot;actual engineering&quot; is hard. Given that most people are mediocre in ability (&quot;licensing&quot; is just about formal requirements, whether one can jump through the hoops, as opposed to actually being super smart), it&#x27;s really scary if building a bridge or a building is &quot;hard&quot;.<p>On the other hand, building robust yet complex software is actually hard. There&#x27;s no software equivalent of &quot;just spend more money on materials to allow for a 10000% margin of error to ensure it doesn&#x27;t break&quot;. Spending more money stops working at a certain point, for example, hiring more people doesn&#x27;t work, per Mythical Man Month; spending more effort on handling edge cases don&#x27;t always work, because writing more code with minimal utility means an even less maintainable project in the long run. Correct code almost has to be &quot;mathematically perfect&quot; in order to be small, simple-as-need-be, and robust. And then even if your own code is 100% error free, you have potential bugs all the way down from frameworks, compilers, to even the CPU (eg. Spectre).<p>Software development definitely has one of the highest skill ceiling among the trades that I know of. Sure this doesn&#x27;t apply to whoever wrote your CRUD app, but think about it -- let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re thinking of building a skyscraper that requires extremely difficult engineering (whatever that means) to properly build, nothing short of the most brilliant engineer would be capable of planning and executing the project, any mistakes would lead to a complete collapse of the building... would you want to proceed with this project?<p>Yet people start software projects like these for fun.

The user experience of most pre-Mac computers was &quot;black screen with glowing green bracket&quot;. If you typed something, the computer would respond &quot;SYNTAX ERROR&quot;, which was even more intimidating. You in your ignorance had committed not just an error, but a <i>syntax</i> error, whatever that was.<p>Seeing a Mac for the first time, from the smiling icon at bootup to the way the pointer moved over things, and the way you could click to make things appear on the screen, was a transformative moment similar to the first time people a generation later encountered an image-capable web browser.  It was one of those moments (like seeing VisiCalc in action) that made large numbers of people realize that a world was coming when computers might be usable by, and useful to, regular mortals.<p>I was nine years old when I saw my first Mac in 1984, and my only previous experience with computers was teaching an IBM PC to print &#x27;BUTT&#x27; in an infinite loop using BASIC.

His father was an engineer for Ping and they had a computer at their house. We weren&#x27;t allowed to touch it but we watched his dad play a Star Trek game on it for a little while.<p>A couple years later I&#x27;d get my hands on a TRS-80 at school. I loved it.<p>When I went to high school in 1983 we had the Apple IIe in our lab. I spent hours on them doing basic and later Pascal. By then I had a vic-20 at home.
I was a part of a nerdy group that hung out in the computer lab any time we could and we had a pretty good relationship with the head of the match department. When they go their first Mac, that was the first time I saw gui in person.<p>We were given a few minutes to play with it and I really liked it. I don&#x27;t think it was so shocking though. While the command line was my normal initial interface, I was used to playing games that provided a GUI of their own to interact with the game. The gui on the mac was another program like a game running on top of the OS.<p>After high school I didn&#x27;t have a pc of my own for years. When I did get one is was a Packard Bell sx386 running DOS. I had that for a decent amount of time before I got my first copy of windows. For me it all just fit together and I would say to this day I think of a computer and it&#x27;s operating system as the CLI it provides. The GUI is an abstraction that runs on top. I like a nice desktop ( KDE is my favorite ) but I get very frustrated any time I can&#x27;t get underneath it and do what I want.

Indeed. When the Mac came out, my friend and I went to a local computer store to look at one.<p>My friend sat there for several minutes, mostly just playing with the menu bar, watching the menus come and go, flickering as he went from one to another with the mouse. He just sat there slack jawed going “Wow!”.<p>Folks have to appreciate the simple marvel of having that beautiful, crisp display with square pixels. This was not routine.<p>It was amazing.<p>We both bought one with the student discount. $1480 for a 128k Mac. Over $4300 inflation adjusted today. At the time a box of floppies were $40. Man did we blow vast amounts of money on computer hardware back then.<p>And, yes, a 128k, single floppy Mac was borderline useless. We got back alley RAM upgrades and external floppy drives. There went another $800.<p>But with that we could develop in C on the machine.</div><br/><div id="36569651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36569651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OnlyMortal</span><span>|</span><a href="#36564736">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36568202">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36566169">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36569651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36569651">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MPW C?<p>It was my first usable C compiler with the awesome MPW Shell.

The Macintosh team redesigned the software of the Lisa from scratch to make it operate more efficiently, since the Macintosh was to have far less memory than the 1 million bytes of the Lisa.</i><p>The article also reminded me how <i>expensive</i> computers were in those days. Accounting for inflation, the $2500 Macintosh would be about $7500 today, and the $10,000 Lisa with its 1 million bytes of memory would be $30,000.<p>Back in 1982, I decided the just-introduced IBM PC was not a real computer because it didn&#x27;t have a front panel with lights and switches. So I bought an Ithaca Intersystems DPS-1, a high end S-100 system with a Z80 processor and a real front panel, for $8000. Later I added a 20 megabyte hard drive for another $6000.

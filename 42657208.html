Without what Biden did right before the war saying “it’s going to happen” and mustering broad domestic and international support as well as using sanctions to freeze Russian assets and use them to pay Ukraine for reparations, Ukraine wouldn’t exist today.<p>We’re talking about $70B of military HW and $23B in terms of economic and humanitarian aid and another ~87B for the Ukrainian government to keep the lights on.

The international community has also contributed another $100B.<p>&gt; We aren&#x27;t going to see a WWI or WWII rematch unless the AI &quot;revolution&quot; actually turns out to be more than smoke and mirrors for dumb money and enables perfect missile defense or something.<p>It’s a slower burn. Putin isn’t going to try to take everything at once. It’s the Hitler annexation strategy over a longer time period. A little Georgia here, a little Crimea there, now it’s the entirety of Ukraine. Partly because his country is weaker but also because war is more expensive to prosecute than 100 years ago due to technology and the resistance is much better prepared for such an attempt.<p>Where do you think Eastern and Western European civilians will flee if any of those countries is drawn into conflict with Russia? Conflict forces desperate immigration which then creates anti-immigration counter responses in domestic populations here in the US.<p>China is important but what are we going to do there? Do you think we’re going to successfully defend an invasion of Taiwan when it happens? Cause that’s going to be their first military action. And if people are complaining about supporting Ukraine, how do you think they’ll fair regarding Chinese nationalists?<p>Finally, I’m pretty sure the troops and equipment we need there are also fairly different. If China is delivering huge numbers of land troops to Taiwan in the first place I’d say the battle is very lost.

Note that digital means the use of digits, not necessarily any involvement of computers or electronics.<p>For example, if they take a reading on a sextant, write down a number, and manually transfer it to a coordinate on paper, then that is a semi-digital process. If they take a number and then look up some kind of trigonometric table, that is definitely digital and not analog. But if the navigation process entirely consists of analog mechanical linkages and at no point any number is read out, then I would deem it 100% analog.<p>&gt; using the radian rule, steering 1 degree off base course for 12 hours at a speed of 16 knots results in nearly 3.5 nm left or right of track (565 yards per hour)<p>This brings up a laughable feature of the US customary measurement &quot;system&quot;, a hodge-podge of units with no coherent logic to it: 1 nautical mile ≈ 2025.371... yards, an awkward number that isn&#x27;t even whole. This is because 1 nautical mile = 1852 metres exact and 1 yard = 0.9144 metre exact. Converting between these units would be a pain. (Whereas at least 1 mile = 1760 yards exact.)<p>Analogously, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re piloting an airplane at an altitude of 15000 feet and have a horizontal distance of 7 nautical miles to your landing site. What would be the descent angle if you flew down in a straight line? The answer is not immediately obvious because you can&#x27;t do trigonometry on different units. Whereas if I said you&#x27;re 4572 m high and 12964 m horizontal distance away, then the angle is arctan(4572&#x2F;12964) ≈ 19.4°.

Ordinary quartz crystals have an accuracy of ±10 ppm.  That&#x27;s ±0.001%.  That&#x27;s plenty accurate unless you&#x27;ve been at sea for a long time.  10 ppm of a month is 26 seconds, during which time the equator rotates 12 km (6 arc minutes, 1.9 milliradians).  That&#x27;s not &quot;a few degrees&quot;.<p>Of course if you have a GPS signal you can keep time to within nanoseconds, but I suppose we&#x27;re assuming GPS is jammed.<p>Cellphone cameras typically have pixel pitch on the order of 250 microradians, but star trackers routinely deliver attitude information accurate to less than a tenth of a pixel, so 25 microradians, which is 5 arc seconds, not &quot;a few degrees&quot;.  Calibrating a star tracker for a mass-market camera with its nonlinear distortions is a pain in the ass but can be done.  25 microradians is 160 meters.<p>SatState from F-Droid shows that my cellphone&#x27;s accelerometer (tilt sensor) seems to vary by ±0.01m&#x2F;s² in each of its ≈200ms samples, which is about a milliradian of error, 40× worse than the camera error, about two weeks of clock drift.  This isn&#x27;t &quot;a few degrees&quot; either.  Accelerometers can integrate over arbitrarily long periods of time to reduce noise; to reduce noise by 40×, assuming a Gaussian distribution, you need about 1600 samples (320 seconds, 5 minutes and 20 seconds) to average out to the same level as the camera error.<p>(It&#x27;s easiest if the phone is sitting still during the averaging time, but both the gyros and the star tracker attitude information permit you to usefully average the accelerometer signal over time even when the phone is changing attitude.)<p>You probably do need to calibrate the angle between the accelerometer and the camera, but it probably won&#x27;t change significantly over time for a given phone.<p>The clock seems like it could be the weak point here, but even the clock is only drifting a few hundred meters a day, and that only produces an east-west error.</div><br/><div id="42668723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42668723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">myself248</span><span>|</span><a href="#42659447">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42667452">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659797">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42668723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42668723">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This would be really neat to implement, honestly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42659797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42659797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">UniverseHacker</span><span>|</span><a href="#42659447">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659713">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42667452">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42659797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42659797">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’re right, but they can be used together with a sextant to instantly preform calculations that can be time consuming and difficult at sea.<p>I use an app to double check my hand calculations.</div><br/><div id="42660443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42660443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bhhaskin</span><span>|</span><a href="#42659447">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659797">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42661162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42660443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42660443">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At that point though you are using a sextant and a fancy calculator =P</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42661162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42661162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saulpw</span><span>|</span><a href="#42659447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42659713">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42661162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42661162">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But what happens when the smartphone is bricked by an EMP, or hacked by a nation-state virus?

I&#x27;ve taken the current prototype as far as it should go. The architecture is really only suited for single player experiences. I wanted get to a point where I had convinced myself that the concept was feasible and fun, and I&#x27;ve done that. The ultimate goal of this project is to build a product that can function as an autonomous vehicle development platform. To get to there, I&#x27;ll need to work with people who have built large multiplayer games and autonomous systems.

And the go-kart is moving slowly enough that spinouts aren&#x27;t an issue. However, given the right vehicle design, I&#x27;m sure that they could be intentionally conducted in a controlled manner.

The SuperH processor is a Japanese design developed by Hitachi in the late 1990&#x27;s. As a second generation hybrid RISC design it was easier for compilers to generate good code for than earlier RISC chips, and it recaptured much of the code density of earlier CISC designs by using fixed length 16 bit instructions (with 32 bit register size and address space), using microcoding to allow some instructions to perform multiple clock cycles of work. (Earlier pure risc designs used one instruction per clock cycle even when that served no purpose but to make the code bigger and exhaust the encoding space.)<p>Hitachi developed 4 generations of SuperH. SH2 made it to the United states in the Sega Saturn game console, and SH4 powered the Sega Dreamcast. They were also widely used in areas outside the US cosumer market, such as the japanese automative industry.<p>But during the height of SuperH&#x27;s development, the 1997 asian economic crisis caused Hitachi to tighten its belt, eventually partnering with Mitsubishi to spin off its microprocessor division into a new company called &quot;Renesas&quot;. This new company did not inherit the Hitachi engineers who had designed SuperH, and Renesas&#x27; own attempts at further development on SuperH didn&#x27;t even interest enough customers for the result to go ito production. Eventually Renesas moved on to new designs it had developed entirely in-house, and SuperH receded in importance to them... until the patents expired.&quot;</div><br/><div id="41613880" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41613880" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikepurvis</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613786">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615426">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41613880">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41613880">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interesting point of history— the H8 processor is the MCU that powers the original Lego Mindstorms RCX.

A few of the incidents it mentions include (my summary below is more based on my own knowledge of the topic, than what the video specifically mentions):<p>Fujitsu and Hitachi cloned IBM mainframes. So did lots of other companies. At the time they started doing it, IBM was (intentionally) releasing their software into the public domain. However, in 1969, IBM announced they&#x27;d start copyrighting their software. Initially they still released the core OS (primarily MVS) into the public domain, and only copyrighted add-ons. However, as the 1970s progressed, more and more new functionality went into the copyrighted add-ons, while the public domain core received only limited enhancements. Finally, in the early 1980s, they put the whole OS under copyright. This left Fujitsu and Hitachi in a difficult position. They were used to getting their mainframe OS from IBM for free, and suddenly they couldn&#x27;t legally do that any more. Legal choices for them would have included: (1) fork IBM&#x27;s operating system and create new enhancements themselves (either clone IBM&#x27;s copyrighted enhancements by clean-room engineering, or design their own incompatible enhancements), (2) negotiate with IBM for a license (unclear if IBM would agree, and may have cost $$$), (3) license an alternative operating system (e.g. UNIX), (4) build their own OS from scratch. But none of those options appealed to them (or maybe they tried some and it wasn&#x27;t working out), so they decide to go with option (5): illegally copy IBM&#x27;s copyrighted mainframe operating systems. They used the fact that IBM still shipped the source code for much of its copyrighted software to customers, and somehow got customers to (illegally) hand that source code over. They made rather trivial changes to the source code to try to hide the copying–for example, Fujitsu renamed a lot of IBM routines whose name started with the letter I, to start with the letter J instead. They searched and replaced IBM copyright notices with their own. They even bribed IBM employees to give them IBM confidential material (the IBM employees accepted the bribes as part of an FBI sting operation). And IBM found out, and sued both Fujitsu and Hitachi, and the settlement of the suit required Fujitsu and Hitachi to pay IBM hundreds of millions of dollars, and also banned Fujitsu and Hitachi from continuing to sell the software outside Japan (IBM agreed to let them continue selling it in Japan, in exchange for them paying licensing fees.)<p>Other stuff I know about this topic (not in the video): In the 1980s and early 1990s, Fujitsu mainframes were quite popular in Australia, but due to this settlement, by the end of the 1990s, basically all of Fujitsu&#x27;s Australian mainframe customers had either migrated to IBM mainframes, or else to non-mainframe platforms. There are still Fujitsu and Hitachi mainframes running in Japan today, but they are deeply legacy, basically stuck in the 1990s – they didn&#x27;t follow IBM&#x27;s transition to 64-bit in 2001. Fujitsu and Hitachi weren&#x27;t the only mainframe vendors faced with this problem, but other vendors sought to solve it within the confines of the law. In the US, Amdahl had the same issue, but it decided to focus on their Unix variant UTS instead of MVS. (Amdahl did have an internal project to build a clone of IBM&#x27;s MVS, apparently based on legal clean-room reverse engineering, called Aspen, but it got caught in development hell, and Amdahl cancelled it before they ever officially shipped it, although possibly a few customers got beta test versions.) Germany&#x27;s Nixdorf had a fork of IBM&#x27;s DOS&#x2F;VS operating system (for low-end mainframes), which they got by acquiring the American company TCSC; they ported the Unix clone Coherent to run on top of it, before killing it off in the late 1980s when Nixdorf decided to give up on mainframes and focus purely on Unix instead. Other mainframe vendors didn&#x27;t have this problem because their operating systems were not based on IBM&#x27;s – for example, the other Japanese mainframe vendor, NEC, their mainframes run a fork of GE&#x2F;Honeywell&#x2F;Bull&#x27;s GCOS operating system (ACOS), which NEC legally licensed.<p>Another incident the video discusses is the TRON project, which was a Japanese indigenous standard for operating system APIs, endorsed by the Japanese government, conceptually similar to POSIX. It included both variants aimed at general purpose computing (BTRON) and embedded systems (ITRON). However, this frightened the US software industry, which convinced the US government to declare TRON a &quot;trade barrier&quot;. And that mostly killed TRON as an operating system. TRON didn&#x27;t die completely, it still sees some use in embedded systems even today (the video mentions the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers run it), but it never achieved the original vision of becoming Japan&#x27;s standard operating system. Instead, Microsoft Windows did.<p>And then there were also macroeconomic issues (Japan&#x27;s real estate crisis in the 1990s), and cultural issues – it mentions how the Japanese government encouraged Japanese industry to focus on copying successful Western technologies, even improving them incrementally in the process, as opposed to coming up with fundamentally novel technologies of their own. That approach served Japan very well for industries such as cars, but doesn&#x27;t work so well for the software industry.</div><br/><div id="41615548" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41615548" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rvba</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613474">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614900">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615273">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41615548">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41615548">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It makes sense to have one stanfard across the world.

Japanese PCs <i>had</i> to be different early on because of the complexities of the written language. All of the important characters could be handled in just a few bits (7 or 8) and low resolution in Western markets, with different fonts and character maps dropped in to support a few different alphabets.<p>But in CJK countries, things were much harder and the entire I&#x2F;O system had to be significantly more capable than what might pass for usable elsewhere. This meant larger ROMs, larger framebuffers, higher resolution displays, more complex keyboarding systems, the works. Everything was harder and more expensive for a long time. A common add-on was ROMs with Kanji (Chinese derived characters) support in the same way a person in the West might buy a new sound card or get a VGA card. Except this was just so you could use your new $1200 computer (in today&#x27;s money) to write things on.<p>Back then, given limited memory, you also ended up with a ton of different display modes that offered different tradeoffs between color, resolution, and refresh. Because of the complex character sets, these Japanese systems tended to focus on fewer colors and higher resolution while the west focused on more colors at a lower res in the same or less memory space (any fans of mode 13h?). The first PC-98 (the 9801) shipped in 1982 with 128k of RAM and a 640x400 display with special display hardware. The equivalent IBM-PC shipped with 16KB of RAM and CGA graphics which could give you a display no higher than 640x200 with 1-bit colors but was mostly used in 320x200 with 4 (terrible) colors.<p>Even with similar base architectures, these formative differences meant that lots of the guts of the systems were laid out different to accommodate this -- especially in the memory maps.<p>By the time &quot;conventional&quot; PCs were able to handle the character display needs (sometime in the mid-90s), they were selling in the millions of units per anum which drove down their per unit prices.<p>The Japanese market was severely fractured and in a smaller addressable market. Per unit costs were higher, but the software was largely the same. Porting the same businessware to half a dozen platforms cost too much. So now the average user of the Japanese systems had a smaller library of software which was more or less a copy of what was on IBM PCs, on more expensive hardware -- market forces solved the rest.<p>(btw, the FM Towns, IIR, also had specialized graphics hardware to produce arcade-like graphics with tiles and sprites and so on, making it even more different)<p>Some of this history also informs why home computing lagged in Japan compared to the West despite having all of the other prerequisites for it to take off.<p>graphics<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pc98.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pc98.org&#x2F;</a><p>memory maps<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radioc.web.fc2.com&#x2F;column&#x2F;pc98bas&#x2F;pc98memmap_en.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radioc.web.fc2.com&#x2F;column&#x2F;pc98bas&#x2F;pc98memmap_en.htm</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Memory_Map_(x86)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Memory_Map_(x86)</a></div><br/><div id="41613725" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41613725" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tkgally</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613380">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41613725">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41613725">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Excellent summary. A few additional comments from personal memory:<p>I have lived in Japan since 1983, and I started working as a freelance Japanese-to-English translator in 1986. I wanted to produce clean-looking text in English for my clients, so after a few months using a manual typewriter I took out a loan and bought a Macintosh with a dot-matrix printer. If I remember correctly, it cost six hundred thousand yen. The Mac could not handle Japanese; when I needed to write Japanese text, such as for notes to clients, I wrote by hand. I eventually bought a dedicated Japanese word processor for writing clean text in Japanese.<p>Around 1992, I bought a modem and went online, first to a local foreign-run BBS and then, a couple of years later, the Internet. Many of the first friends I made online were Japanese-English translators like myself, and some of the most active discussion groups I took part in were about the Japanese language and translation.<p>The display of Japanese characters in our online discussions was a problem for a long time. Even as more and more of the participants became able to type Japanese on their own computers, they were using a variety of OSs and character encodings, and the Japanese parts of their messages, when posted online, would be corrupted more often than not. When discussing a particular Japanese expression, we would have to romanize the Japanese and, sometimes, explain what kanji were used.<p>Here’s are two examples from posts to a translators’ mailing list in 1998:<p>&gt; While this handbook uses &quot;åòå≈ê´&quot; for &quot;robustness&quot;, the systems engineers I work with prefer &quot;ÉçÉoÉXÉgê´&quot; &lt;robasutosei&gt;.<p>&gt; Ruth, the kanji for taikou are tai (as in taishi - Crown Prince) and kou (as in kugurido - the radical is mon with gou inside (gou = au&#x2F;awasersu).  Does this help? The dictionary meaning obviously does not make sense here.<p>This made it impractical to discuss longer texts or to have our discussions in both English and Japanese.<p>It was a great relief when, around 2000 or so, the encoding issues were gradually resolved and we became able to write Japanese freely in our online discussions.<p>(Addendum: I am still in touch with some of the people on that mailing list, including the Ruth mentioned above. In fact, last month I attended a party in Yokohama in honor of her and her husband’s 55th wedding anniversary. Several other friends I first met online in the mid-1990s were there, too.)</div><br/><div id="41614182" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614182" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bane</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613380">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613725">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614048">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614182">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614182">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh wow, that&#x27;s a great personal story.<p>I would imagine things begin to improve around 2000 due to the broad adoption of unicode?

I don&#x27;t remember the exact timing, but it was the switchover to Unicode by Windows and Mac that finally resolved the character encoding conflicts (mostly).<p>I don&#x27;t know how much attention this got outside Japan, but there was significant opposition here to Unicode for a while from some Japanese intellectuals. Handwritten and, sometimes, typeset Japanese has traditionally allowed for a lot of minor variations in the forms of kanji. A person might write their name with an extra stroke in one character, for example. Some of those variants are ignored in Unicode as well as in the Japanese encodings on which it is based, and some people kicked up a fuss about it in the Japanese press. I remember reading rants accusing Bill Gates of trying to suppress Japanese culture by imposing a homogenized character encoding through Windows.<p>The controversy has long since died down, though there have been efforts to develop more comprehensive character sets of Japanese and other Asian languages, such as TRON Code and Mojikyō:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TRON_(encoding)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TRON_(encoding)</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mojiky%C5%8D" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mojiky%C5%8D</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41614614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oefrha</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613380">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614182">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41615175">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614048">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614614">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In fact, I occasionally run (currently maintained) CJK commercial software on my en-US Windows installation and I still run into ??? from time to time and have to guess what the text is supposed to be.

TRON was included along with rice, semiconductors, and telecommunications equipment in a list of items targeted by Super-301 (complete stop of import based on section 301 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988). It was removed from the list after the USTR inspection team visited the TRON Association in May. In June the Japanese government expressed their regret at U.S. intervention but accepted this request not to make it standard in schools, thus ending the BTRON project. Callon opines that the project had nevertheless run into such difficulties that the U.S. intervention allowed the government to save face from cancelling the project.<p>According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, in 1989 US officials feared that TRON could undercut American dominance in computers, but that in the end PC software and chips based on the TRON technology proved no match for Windows and Intel&#x27;s processors as a global standard. In the 1980s Microsoft had at least once lobbied Washington about TRON until backing off, but Ken Sakamura himself believed Microsoft wasn&#x27;t the impetus behind the Super-301 listing in 1989.

He asks again &quot;But what is in this small box there?&quot; and receives &quot;That&#x27;s your three non-working gizmos, like you ordered&quot;.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41614507" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614507" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hedora</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613580">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614043">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614706">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41613348">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614507">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614507">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My switch and midrange sony tv (which just turned ten years old, and is still “good enough”) seem like decent counterexamples.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41613348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41613348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">permo-w</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613580">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614084">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41613348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41613348">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">is &quot;PC platform&quot; the standard term here?

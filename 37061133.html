It&#x27;s extremely accessible because of the first-person nature of the accounts, and I think one of the reason it&#x27;s so compelling is that you can feel the change sweeping through so many aspects of daily life.

For instance, just among the Founding Fathers - John Adams lived to 90, Sam Adams to 81, Ben Franklin to 84, John Jay to 83, Thomas Jefferson to 83, James Madison to 85. The only person that didn&#x27;t make it to their 50s, Alexander Hamilton, was killed in a duel (by the current vice president, at the time, no less).<p>Most people know about low life expectancies in the past, but then extrapolate that to your expected age of age of death, but that&#x27;s completely wrong. Low life expectancies were owing almost entirely to extremely high rates of infant mortality. If one guy lives to 80, and another dies shortly after birth - you now have a life expectancy of 40 years. The peaks of human longevity don&#x27;t seem to have changed much, if at all, for millennia.<p>More people are able to hit those peaks, but that&#x27;s generally owing to pretty simple advancements like antibiotics, as well as doing away with what were probably overtly harmful treatments. For instance George Washington died relatively young at 67. And while there is some debate on the exact cause, there&#x27;s reason to believe that his treatment contributed to it. He was being leeched, which was supposed to balance out the 4 humors of the body by drawing out &#x27;bad blood.&#x27; And people were reaching the same heights of longevity in the context of <i>that</i> being the bleeding edge of medicine.</div><br/><div id="37086217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37086217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">otabdeveloper4</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085082">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085999">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085436">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37086217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37086217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>When mankind had become corrupted in the period preceding the flood, God said: &#x27;My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for he is flesh; his days shall be a hundred and twenty years&#x27;</i> (Gen. 6:3).<p>This probably dates back to the early bronze age or even the neolithic.

We’ve mostly understood exactly what “aging” is, and are now on our way of nudging it in various directions with very promising results in mice. The lifespan podcast can be a nice primer to where we are right now. Though its such a fast moving field it might be out of date now already.<p>The last paper I saw had some great results in primates, human trials maybe this year.

Like traditional techniques that we know work, but now we’re aware exactly why. Like fasting for example. And its not just the actual age you die that can be affected but how you feel throughout your life - e.g. how “young” you feel. And the great thing is that those techniques have been tested in various cultures around the world for centuries, so there is some actual data to back things up, and with the recent discoveries we can separate the things that actually made a difference with the pageantry and the irrelevant or bad stuff, and get you to live at the longest your genes can do, maybe even a bit longer.<p>The truly great thing for me is that we now apparently can measure biological age accurately without having to wait for people to die to add to a datapoint, so that we can quickly iterate, and obviously we’ll need to wait for decades to be sure and prove stuff without a shadow of doubt, but seems to me we might be closer than ever before!</div><br/><div id="37085833" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37085833" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p1esk</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085082">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085436">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37086216">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37085833">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37085833">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Other than calorie restriction, is there a method to extend mice lifespan?<p>I mean actually extending it.

A fertility rate of &quot;N&quot; results in a generational ratio of 1 person of the current (older) generation to (N&#x2F;2) of the next (younger) generation. So a fertility rate of 2 means the current (older) generation will be exactly the same size as the subsequent (younger) generation.<p>But if we assume a fertility rate of 1, which is the direction most developed countries are headed, then each successive (younger) generation will be half as large as the (older) one before. This means society will be disproportionately composed of the ever-more elderly, with socioeconomic chaos, or Logan&#x27;s Run, soon to follow. This would, counterintuitively, be true even if life expectancy was low. If we all died at 50 you&#x27;d just end up with a society with a larger and larger chunk of your population around 50 years old, until eventually there was  no population left at all.<p>And, vice versa, a fertility rate of e.g. 6 (as is the case in some places in Africa), means that each successive (younger) generation will be 3x as large as the previous (older) one. So you will always have extremely low mean and median ages in this context, again regardless of whether life expectancy was high or low.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37085342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37085342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">suslik</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085082">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085221">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37086058">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37085342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37085342">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I suspect OP means life extension through directly targeting the nmolecular mechanisms of aging - &quot;Howarth&#x27;s clock&quot;, telomerases, transcription factors etc.</div><br/><div id="37085391" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37085391" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rnk</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085082">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085342">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37085391">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37085391">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">David Sinclair has entered the chat.</div><br/><div id="37085455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37085455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seer</span><span>|</span><a href="#37085082">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085391">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085982">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37085455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37085455">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not sure the satire at play here?

OLEDs have three major sources of degradation.  The percentage of Vitas will good OLED screens are significantly decreasing.<p>* Burn in.  Everyone knows about this, not a huge issue on most Vitas.<p>* Use degradation.  Using the OLED panel will slowly cause it to become more dim, and each color dims at a different rate.  Blue dims 10% by 1k hours, and by 10k hours you can expect half total brightness.  The Vita was released 10 years ago, and many of them have seen thousands of hours of gameplay by now.<p>* UV exposure.  UV radiation is damaging to OLED displays, even when powered off.  Long periods of small exposure, even if kept enclosed in storage, can damage the display.  For Vita displays this is the major problem.  Vitas that were rarely used outside&#x2F;near windows, and were stored in dark places will have the least amount of UV damage.

The home consoles didn&#x27;t get SSDs till 2020. For Vita, the cards were fast enough. The problem was the proprietary nature of the cards. They just cost way too much for the size especially as time wore on. I think at the time I imported my 64GB Vita card, a microSD card of the same size was half the price.

It is partly tech, in that people prefer battery life (you also cannot spend more if your battery has run out), but also technical aspects of graphics simply don’t impress people as much as they did in the 90s. “Content”, and volumes of it, is far more important.<p>The Vita cards were fast enough but not big enough for games that the Sony demographic would want. For example, a Vita scale Gran Turismo or Metal Gear Solid entry is simply not going to improve on the (great) PSP entries.<p>By the time the Vita launched we had already been releasing Android builds for the Xperia Play which were straight up ports from the PSP, as betrayed by the almost uniform 1.6GB per game.<p>Edit: to add a concrete example, the developers of NBA Jam mobile (which was great) went back to 2D afterwards, and came up with a very nice engine for streaming 2D animation and a whole content pipeline system for using it.

Not sure why, these guys go all out to probe and put together circuit diagrams and just about fucking everything. The recent Nintendo modding scene shows this to an extreme.

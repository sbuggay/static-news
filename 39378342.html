It’s more common today for management to be swayed by data - my recollections of the 2000s were interactions more along the lines of<p>“I’ve been doing this for 20 years son, whatever your little spreadsheet contains, I’ve already accounted for just by feeling the air in the room through my superb gut”. - management at that time had gone from playing with Sinclair spectrums in their bedrooms to leading huge multimillion dollar teams, partly because software development had exploded and <i>someone</i> needed to lead those teams. So several managers I ran across seemed to see their position as a result of their greatness and not really anything at all to do with growth in the industry leading to bigger roles needing filled. This is a long way to say it used to be very hard to penetrate a charismatic self-aggrandising tech leader’s thought bubble.<p>Today I definitely see it as different. E.g. if you rock up with a download of CI job runtimes and a couple of off the cuff quotes from team members about what they do when waiting for CI builds (I.e. not much of value), I’d expect you to pretty easily succeed in establish a case for investing in speeding up that feedback loop and the outcome &#x2F; measured results chart of that work would likely make its way through at least a couple of senior management slide decks over the next few weeks.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39379938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39379938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joeig</span><span>|</span><a href="#39378710">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39379891">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39379041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39379938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39379938">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it helps to speak the same „language“ as the manager.

It is true that management sometimes faces budget pressure. But the real skill lies in what they do next. They could - easily - come up with a strategy of feature delivery, and communicate it clearly. Ask engineers to pause red tape, be scrappy for the next few quarters, talk to dependent teams to make certain flows easier. Explicitly use their authority to set the rules aligned with leadership.<p>But this is not what they do. The average management simply pushes indirectly, via 1:1s or individual blaming.<p>&gt; After the manager declines to invest in engineering quality a few times, they have sent a clear message that quality and reliability are secondary to the desire to get things our the door.

I recently got into a long thread argument with someone on HN about this. The person was adamant that people problems can NOW finally be solved by designing technology to be able to handle adversarial and incompetent actors. But the problems that such software tries to solve are tightly defined in scope and cannot deal with actually messed up people or organizational problems. Unless engineers are willing to acknowledge people problems, they will keep banging their heads against the door when the organization isn&#x27;t doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.<p>But it&#x27;s far easier to acknowledge the people problem first and see if there is a solution for that, rather than trying to ram technological solutions through a people-shaped hole. And if the people problem can&#x27;t be solved (i.e., it will often involve a change in culture and leadership style, or else a change in leadership, both of which are difficult), it may be best to give up anyway and wash one&#x27;s hands of the whole mess. In which case, one just sits there going through the motions to pass the day and collect the pay. If they&#x27;re motivated, they&#x27;ll find another job, rather than try to fix the mess, and they&#x27;ll likely be happier doing that too. This is also why it takes a certain non-technical skillset combined with technical skills to succeed in leadership roles. It&#x27;s a completely different game to play.</div><br/><div id="39380064" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39380064" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hinkley</span><span>|</span><a href="#39378816">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39380358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39380064">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39380064">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was watching some interview long ago when the guest hit it square on the head.

The problem here is not that we need technology to reduce construction costs, it&#x27;s that construction costs are being artificially inflated by regulators.<p>But now you come up with a technology that allows construction to be performed in a factory and the local part is limited to taking the thing off the truck and putting it in the building, which takes ten seconds and can be done by the truck driver. Can this solve the problem?<p>Maybe. It depends on whether the incumbents have enough political power to have it banned or made prohibitively expensive. If they do then it won&#x27;t work. But if they don&#x27;t, the technology solves the people problem, by removing the problematic people from the operation.

A lot of these discussions center around how to make housing affordable in cities and whether denser construction leads to lower housing costs or higher housing costs.  But cities don&#x27;t exist to minimize housing costs.  They exist to maximize opportunities: job opportunities, dating opportunities, friendship opportunities, cultural opportunities, and so on.  They exist to bring as many people together as easily as possible.<p>The way that an urban economist would put it is that fundamentally cities are job markets.  I would put it a little more broadly and say that cities are opportunities markets.  For that reason housing in a dense urban environment will never be as affordable as housing out in rural North Dakota.<p>If you build more housing in a city, more people move there, and the city becomes more desirable as a result, is the city better or worse off for having built the housing?</div><br/></div></div><div id="35779280" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35779280" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnboredhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#35783413">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35783355">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35779280">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35779280">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn&#x27;t the obvious arrow here that high prices drives density?

I should point out: Cumberland is already a very densely built city. Its inner urban geography is not unlike Oakland. It just happens to be in a long, painful period of decline. So many of those buildings are empty.<p>The answer is pretty obvious, here. Prices would likely drop. The &quot;induced demand&quot; is caused by <i>economic success</i>, not density itself. Plenty of dense cities have declined. (Cumberland isn&#x27;t even that cold! And it has legal marijuana! And it&#x27;s close to ski resorts! Eat your hearts out, armchair prognosticators!)<p>&gt;we find that indeed, the denser an area, the higher its house prices<p>The data in this graph skew California cities upward because their suburbs are not part of their core urban areas — Concord&#x2F;Walnut Creek is considered separate from the Bay Area, as is Dublin&#x2F;Pleasanton — while cities outside of California are more likely to be connected. This is due to mountains intersecting dense urban geography in California, which doesn&#x27;t happen in most other major cities (but Miami is constrained by swamps and New York does hit mountains to its north). But there are other unusual forces on housing prices in California (Proposition 13, construction difficulties), and without the major California cities the correlation becomes much weaker, before we even consider reverse causation.<p>&gt;No; I think the missing insight is that there’s some pool of geographically mobile Americans1 who are looking for new housing (or who might start looking if the right situation presented itself). These people have various combinations of preferences and requirements. One common pattern is to prefer any big city - they would be happy to live in Seattle, or NYC, or the Bay, if the opportunity came up.<p>High decadal growth rates in Nashville, Charleston SC, Fayetteville AK, Boise, Jacksonville and Bend among other places put the lie to this. There are certainly &quot;trends&quot;, but they aren&#x27;t limited to <i>big</i> cities, and they don&#x27;t really affect <i>all</i> big cities: the Los Angeles metro (of all places!) grew a measly 3% from 2010-20. Surely LA&#x27;s high prices aren&#x27;t primarily driven by a growth rate just a little higher than that of Pittsburgh.<p>There might be some induced demand from certain kinds of housing construction in certain contexts, but this blog post is a <i>long</i> way from demonstrating any such effects. The <i>most</i> well-justified negative effect I&#x27;ve heard of from new housing construction is that businesses serving poorer populations are closed due to increasing commercial rents and competition from businesses serving the new clientele. And this can increase the cost of living for local residents, as well as causing job losses (even if employment statistics improve). What we do know is that sometimes people are worse off after construction happens (hence the uproar in the first place), and unfortunately I don&#x27;t think this kind of 10000-feet analysis brings us closer to understanding why.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35780209" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35780209" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">knallfrosch</span><span>|</span><a href="#35779658">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35779391">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35780209">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35780209">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the post falls into the trap that many others have done too.

If you add units, you&#x27;ve just allowed more people to move from Idaho into the city, and made the entire city potentially <i>more</i> valuable from increased network effect and caused costs to go up further.<p>This process shouldn&#x27;t be expected make it <i>affordable</i> to live in the city, unless you&#x27;ve managed to either damage the utility of living in the city through the secondary effects of increased population&#x2F;density or you&#x27;ve managed to build enough supply the you can sink the entire worldwide demand for living in one of the best and most valuable place, such that there are no more wealthier people anywhere in the world to sell to and you must go down market to get more customers.<p>It would however, increase the number of people who can have the benefits of living there, but at the cost of displacing more people who can no longer afford it... the benefits go to people outside of the city: The wealthy ones that can move into the city, and the rest who enjoy lower competition for housing outside of the city.<p>&gt; Denser housing is very efficient<p>Housing itself increases in efficiency to a moderate level of density-- a duplex is somewhat more efficient to construct than a single family home, owing mostly to reduced land costs (materials are somewhat higher due to the increased isolation and fire protection required).

In these very dense areas it&#x27;s more appropriate to build infrastructure for other modes of transportation — just as it makes more sense to build apartments instead of houses.<p>But if you have a city where trips are already almost always by car, then any induced demand actually represents a new trip that wasn&#x27;t taken before. This must be distinguished from the true Braess paradox [1], which is rare. More trips usually mean that you actually improved people&#x27;s lives, which is a good thing.<p>The thing is that some modern urbanist activists just absolutely hate cars, so they exaggerate the case against roads. There are still other reasons to avoid expanding the road network: it costs money, it creates pollution, it causes crash risks, it drives sprawl and balkanization, and it contributes to impermeable ground cover and urban heat islands. Parking lots do all of this and make life more difficult for people who are walking. But the notion among some urbanists that building roads does absolutely no good is simply wrong. The literature on the economic benefits of road construction is extensive.<p>I think that people who study the issue are leery of alienating their already tiny support base by gainsaying them about this, though. I personally like to point out that replacing intersections with roundabouts can achieve most of the goals of road widening while improving safety and pollution. <i>Strong Towns</i> in its early days emphasized building roads in such a way that all built capacity would be used as effectively as possible, but some more recent activists have been unhappy that they aren&#x27;t more stridently anti-car.<p>1: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Braess_paradox" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Braess_paradox</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35779373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35779373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cammikebrown</span><span>|</span><a href="#35779391">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35778950">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35779373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35779373">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Building market rate housing will lower prices in the long term (decades) as older housing stock becomes out of date and affordable, but in the short term it only helps the most wealthy.

Walls and insulation need more expensive materials (for equivalent sound dampening levels), when buildings are closer together.

Labor costs are higher and labor time needed is higher (for equivalent results), and so on.<p>A few costs go down (less length of pipe material, or less length of wire, etc).

People are sacrificing earning potential to be in a more fun area, which makes sense.</div><br/><div id="35779362" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35779362" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stale2002</span><span>|</span><a href="#35778950">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35779339">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35779362">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35779362">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Once again, if your statement was true, people wouldn&#x27;t be moving to NYC, or SF, for the highly paid jobs.<p>If they could get highly paid jobs, elsewhere, they wouldn&#x27;t pay the high cost of living, to be near the high paying jobs.<p>I am not sure what theory you could invent, that would cause people to move to a high cost of living area, if not for the high paying opportunities in those areas.<p>If, instead they could get better opportunities elsewhere, why pay the high cost of living?<p>&gt; People are sacrificing earning potential to be in a more fun area<p>Hey, if you know of any jobs that pay 500k a year, for a sofware eng position, not in SF or NYC, please let me know then!<p>I&#x27;m going to say, that actually its the salaries though.</div><br/><div id="35779371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35779371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">endisneigh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35778950">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35779362">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35779371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35779371">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Once again, if your statement was true, people wouldn&#x27;t be moving to NYC, or SF, for the highly paid jobs.<p>adjusted wages for rent is not the only consideration. cities have far more amenities, which are beyond the scope of the discussion.<p>it&#x27;s simply a fact, however, that if you&#x27;re simply looking at square footage, rent, and wage, the densest cities in the united states do not give you the highest wages. there&#x27;s really no point in arguing about it, you can go look for yourself.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I worked at a regional newspaper and their subscription price was more than the New York Times. Their subscriber base was basically all old, suburban white people who still got print newspapers. Print is still the cash cow of regionals to this day.<p>They had terrible technology. Stories, of course, were always presented as... stories. They were stuck in their ways. No emphasis on, like the post mentions, creating good data products - e.g. events, restaurants, weather maps, etc.<p>A big hurdle for newspapers is, yes, on giving away their news for free in the early days of the web - creating a certain expectation. But also their arrogance of not adapting to the times. The Charlotte Agenda was one of the only digital only profitable news publications before it got bought by Axios. They made money from a jobs board and other ideas (that I am now forgetting) that would cater to a regional audience.<p>News people tend to think &quot;journalism is sacred&quot; to the point of myopia. Their product is outdated. I read the New York Times for national news, but regional news (which is the majority of newspapers) consistently don&#x27;t appeal to me. Why would I pay to read about a carjacking in a far off neighborhood? Yes, give me important stories, but also give me visuals and data and products that would fit into the &quot;not video&quot; segment. Even feature stories just don&#x27;t have much pizzaz - who really wants to read an interview - I want to watch an interview.

They had a big sun-room at rear, with big tables where numerous newspapers were found spread out in various stages of completion. One glance across the table provided immediate feedback on a range of headlines, pictures, and articles. You can instantly see how long a piece will take to read. So with coffee in hand, you sit down and <i>enjoy</i> the experience.<p>Newspapers when spread out on tables provide superior readability than a single screen tablet where scrolling and wrestling all the annoyances is a test of patience.<p>If someone invents a lightweight digital &quot;book&quot; the size of a newspaper but containing less pages, maybe 10 or 20 double-sided digital e-ink pages that can be turned like real pages, I believe people will buy it.<p>The spine would allow the book to lie flat on any page, like a ring-bound book. When you get to the end, obviously you could choose to load up the next 10 pages from that publisher, or switch to a different publication. Importantly, the book can be left open, laying around the house for the next person to wander in with their coffee, sit down and have a relaxing browse though stories both local and global. No annoyances, no pop-ups, no tracking how long it takes you to read a page or any of that nonsense.<p>Before we label regional people &quot;outdated&quot;, perhaps consider they simply like better reading experiences with their morning coffee.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41260721" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41260721" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">impure</span><span>|</span><a href="#41262122">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41260692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41260721">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41260721">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have trouble believing any of these reasons.

The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> had a very strong (if of course pro-business) reputation when it was still owned by the Dow Jones corporation, somewhat less so of late.  Newswires such as AP, Reuters, and AFP are also generally quite good.  You can also find regional business news publications of high quality and relevance, <i>especially</i> as compared with their non-business local counterparts.<p>In debunking a century-plus old hoax (the &quot;Banker&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;) a few years back, one of the more amusing bits I&#x27;d found was that of all the claims it made, one which was more easily addressed was a mention-in-passing of the failures of several banks.  It turns out that of all the things that a bank-centric publication is interested in, it&#x27;s the solvency of financial institutions, and the bulk of any given issue addressed insolvencies and failures, of which those mentioned in the (bogus) manifesto made no appearance...<p>I suspect that a large reason for greater relevance and accuracy is that <i>business news tends to be actionable</i> to businesses, executives, and managers.  I also suspect that misquotations and misrepresentations of interviews tend to get sharp responses.  By contrast, the principle operating principle of a mass-market paper is to maximise circulation and eyeballs.  At the worst of the Penny Papers this lead to outright hoaxes (e.g., the Great Moon Hoax: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Moon_Hoax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Moon_Hoax</a>&gt;).  And of course, with large circulations it was also possible to steer public opinion (e.g., exploiting the explosion of the USS <i>Maine</i> to incite the Spanish-American war by Hearst and Pulitzer:  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USS_Maine_(1889)#Yellow_journalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USS_Maine_(1889)#Yellow_journa...</a>&gt;).<p>But I&#x27;d suggest that the population for whom quality, relevant news is of high interest is relatively small.</div><br/><div id="41262822" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41262822" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taeric</span><span>|</span><a href="#41261123">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41262128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41263303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41262822">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41262822">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That last line is one I was aiming at, but I do not have any way to quantify it.<p>I used to want to try and make the news valuable to myself.

Newspapers got the bulk of their funding from advertising back then, so readers&#x27; expectations haven&#x27;t really changed that much, the newspapers have simply gotten much worse at funding themselves with ads.</div><br/><div id="41263274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41263274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asdff</span><span>|</span><a href="#41260432">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41261874">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41263274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41263274">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The real death of the news was that with the internet, these sleepy old papers suddenly had competition from around the world.

Generally, this is achieved through spending and taxation[1], legislation and regulation, and in some cases specific executive roles.  <i>Most</i> functions of government, passage of laws, operation of courts, defence, social welfare, backstop insurance,[2] and public goods and services such as schools, roads, police, fire, ports, and often services including hospitals, sewerage, water, electricity, postal services, and occasionally communications and media.<p>There are of course many instances of media organisations directly funded through governments, most especially in broadcasting:  the BBC, ABC (Australia), CBC, Deutsche Welle, Deutschlandfunk, and more, partial list here:  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41262025">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41262025</a>&gt;.<p><i>Print</i> media has more often been at least nominally privately-held, <i>but often with major indirect public support</i>.  In the US that takes the form of discounted postal rates, legal notices, tax breaks, and direct advertising expenditures by governments.

That is, one person&#x27;s consumption doesn&#x27;t preclude others doing so (unlike, say, food or land), and it&#x27;s difficult (though not impossible) to restrict access.<p>- Marginal costs of production, that is, the additional cost for an additional unit produced or consumed, is near nil.  This has implications on how market prices fall, which is (absent other manipulation) also near nil.<p>- News and information have <i>high positive externalities</i>.  That is, there are benefits to consumption which the producer cannot readily capture through market mechanisms.<p>I&#x27;ve addressed this in more length here:  &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170611065351&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dredmorbius&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2vm2da&#x2F;why_information_goods_and_markets_are_a_poor_match&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170611065351&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddi...</a>&gt;<p>A lot of this boils down to &quot;there&#x27;s no easy way to erect tollbooths on the consumption or distribution of information, and high costs in the form of deadweight losses (people excluded from access) from doing so.&quot;<p>But there <i>are</i> at least two remaining tollbooths:<p>- The ISP, with whom the reader has an existing financial relationship.<p>- Tax authorities:  local (city&#x2F;county), state, and national.<p>Each of these can charge audiences, and pay publishers, for media accessed online.  My proposal is that payments be relatively nominal (on the order of $100 to $400&#x2F;year for a household), and be made with minimal prejudice to qualifying publishers and authors.  (Some independent arbitrator of which publishers qualify, and a mechanism, perhaps itself market based, for payment rates based on media category would probably be part of such a scheme.)  Indirect supports analogous to postal-rate subsidies, legal notices, and direct government advertising might also apply.<p>A tax &#x2F; universal content fee approach directly addresses the many issues of applying markets to information goods (addressed in this comment and links).<p><i>All</i> successful media models at scale divorce reveneus from consumption.  Advertising most particularly.<p>TFA and my many comments (as well as those of numerous others in this thread) address what the failures of the status quo are.  Most saliently:  news organisations, print, broadcast, and online are simply failing to survive presently, and lack of effective news and informational sources is a key driver of social and political dysfunction.  Weak media institutions are highly susceptible to malign influences.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.

And then there are organisations, which may be related to governments or effectively similar to governments or agents of governments, with a mission or interest in distorting news so that the money, status, etc., gets delivered.<p>So in theory, under <i>good governance,</i> that wouldn&#x27;t happen. Additionally, the government would be all-knowing with a good grip on salience, so it wouldn&#x27;t do anything biased, even by accident. And then we might as well have news distributed by a central ministry of information, which would reliably arbitrate the truth in a good way.<p>Since actual governments are at best kinda corrupt and somewhat stupid, it would be better for taxpayers to fund <i>a diversity of editorially independent news media sources,</i> right?<p>But that&#x27;s kind of passing the buck to the grass roots. In theory, the natural power of the grass roots can cause information to be critiqued and filtered by by many independent and informed individuals so that a consensus on the facts of what is actually going on bubbles to the top. In reality, it&#x27;s social media, and its accuracy depends on the power of <i>good moderation</i> and a <i>good culture,</i> which, like good governance, is brought into being and sustained by voodoo.<p>I think the answer is: if you&#x27;ve found a good, trustworthy source of information, whether a public broadcaster, a commercial media entity, or a non-commercial forum, treasure it <i>while it lasts,</i> and by all means bring more of these into being.

With very few exceptions (like the NYT), quality is universally very low, journalists are underpaid, etc.<p>What&#x27;s missing in the market is a Netflix like subscription model where you don&#x27;t have to cherry pick one or a handful out of hundreds&#x2F;thousands of news outlets and instead just get access to everything. That&#x27;s worth a few dollars per month to me but since nobody seems willing to build that platform, the money stays in my pocket. I haven&#x27;t bought a news paper in well over a decade. I use an ad blocker. And I&#x27;m pretty well informed. Usually, I have no shortage of stuff to read that is interesting and high quality.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t help that paywalls are easily bypassed. I sometimes read articles behind paywalls via the usual means of archived web pages. And honestly, mostly I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m missing out on a lot of good content. Mostly that stuff just echos what you can read for free elsewhere or is just stating the bleedingly obvious.<p>Worse, some of that paid content seems aimed at people that don&#x27;t have a lot of time or attention span; so we&#x27;re talking very short articles without a lot of depth or substance. E.g. Bloomberg seems to peddle a lot of that. I appreciate that people exist that need that. But that&#x27;s not me. The opposite also seems popular: excruciatingly long form articles with a low signal to noise ratio and lengthy descriptions of the journalist&#x27;s feelings about it all. There&#x27;s a lot of filler content like that. Not worth paying for either as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>The reality is both free and paid news sources tap the same sources of actual news. Competition for bringing actual news is fierce and it&#x27;s rare for exclusive reporting to stay exclusive for more than a few minutes. The value of paying for early access is minimal.<p>Most of these paid outlets are of course owned by big media corporations who are more busy creating share holder value than paying their journalists or investing in the quality they pretend to deliver. The irony is that if they had some platform they could share subscription revenue on, they might have something that&#x27;s worth a lot more than the sum of each of their crumbling little news empires.

His devotion to the &#x27;science&#x27; in computer science is truly something to behold. It&#x27;s not every day you see someone try to reconcile Turing machines with the second law of thermodynamics ...<p>Dr. Vardi&#x27;s Second Law of Thermodynamics for boolean SAT and SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers is truly a marvel of interdisciplinary ambition. In his framework, computational entropy is said to increase with each transition of the Turing machine, as if bits themselves somehow carry thermodynamic weight. He posits that any algorithm—no matter how deterministic—gradually loses &quot;information purity&quot; as it executes, much like how heat dissipates in a closed system.
His real stroke of genius lies in the idea that halting problems are not just undecidable, but thermodynamically unstable. According to Dr. Vardi, attempts to force a Turing machine into solving such problems inevitably lead to an &quot;entropy singularity,&quot; where the machine&#x27;s configuration becomes so probabilistically diffuse that it approaches the heat death of computation. This, he claims, is why brute-force methods become inefficient: they aren’t just computationally expensive, they are thermodynamically costly as well.
Of course, there are skeptics who suggest that his theory might just be an elaborate metaphor stretched to breaking point—after all, it’s unclear if bits decay in quite the same way as particles in a particle accelerator.</div><br/><div id="41877533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41877533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">youoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41877467">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877090">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41877533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41877533">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have to say that reading this from a non expert point of view leaves me wondering if this comment is true or if it is just the result of some elaborate prompt on ChatGPT</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41877090" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41877090" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ykonstant</span><span>|</span><a href="#41877467">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41877090">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41877090">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a great article and I especially liked the notion:<p>&gt;Theoretical physics is highly mathematical, but it aims to explain and predict the real world. Theories that fail at this “explain&#x2F;predict” task would ultimately be discarded. Analogously, I’d argue that the role of TCS is to explain&#x2F;predict real-life computing.<p>as well as the emphasis on the difference between TCS in Europe and the US.  I remember from the University of Crete that the professors all spent serious time in the labs coding and testing.  Topics like Human-Computer Interaction, Operating Systems Research and lots of Hardware (VLSI etc) were core parts of the <i>theoretical</i> Computer Science research areas.  This is why no UoC graduate could graduate without knowledge both in Algorithms and PL theory, for instance, AND circuit design (my experience is from 2002-2007).<p>I strongly believe that this breadth of concepts is essential to Computer Science, and the narrower emphasis of many US departments (not all) harms both the intellectual foundations and practical employment prospects of the graduate.

The piece abruptly ends.<p>One that comes to mind is the recent breakthroughs in AI which have caught theorists flat-footed.

That would be the flip side of Varde&#x27;s argument. I do vaguely recall Aaronson in one of his blog posts or pdf essays* giving a more subtle argument about why P vs NP is central to computer science anyways, and I think that would be a slightly different position than either Varde&#x27;s or his reading of Widgerson&#x27;s here.<p>*See the first several subsections about common Objections in pp 6-7 in: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pnp.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pnp.pdf</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41877431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41877431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">peterkos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41877125">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41877112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41877431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41877431">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like thinking of CS theory as &quot;math, with more hand-waving&quot;.

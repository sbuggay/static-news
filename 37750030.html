And from my experience the largest group in my life appears to be &quot;Sociable acquaintances&quot;. Kind of lowest quality friends. I assume lot of people are similar. They know lot of people and think that they have lots of friends, but when meaning of &quot;friend&quot; gets picked apart it appears that they might have only couple of real friends or even sadder when none. This realisation might bring rejection to the idea that the articles discusses or even trying to find flaws why the article is wrong. I found the article well written and interesting.</div><br/><div id="37775306" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37775306" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">uhura</span><span>|</span><a href="#37774958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774947">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37775306">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37775306">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article reflects well many aspects of western life experience and might be poorly applicable in other contexts. The text shows signals of it when associating certain kinds of relationships to be more prevalent in certain social-economics classes.<p>Having no friends usually is associated with sadness but some people actually associate it with determination and ambition as “friends” are distractions. If you only have acquaintances, an alternative grouping might provide a better framework to explain and reason about it.<p>The overall model provided is a good starting point but seems to assume some general human kindness that might be far from real. Interactions might be faked on one or both sides, relationships usually are not symmetric, people have a difficult time adjusting their interpretation of the real world accordingly to the inputs they receive, and so on.<p>I usually do not use the word friend for people that I mostly interact because of a shared hobby nor for social acquaintances, but I understand that they fit the authors definition.<p>In practice the text has more value if you replace “friends” with “people you interact with” and if you add a “none of the above” category. Which does not diminish the value of the article in any way.</div><br/><div id="37776133" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37776133" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nonrandomstring</span><span>|</span><a href="#37774958">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37775306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37775570">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37776133">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37776133">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I too found the Machiavellian deconstruction distasteful at times. But
it&#x27;s a useful lens. Like all such categorical psychology - personality
types and whatnot - it&#x27;s a blunt utility, one that may even rally
&quot;experimental evidence&quot; to its support, but ultimately is elegant
observation of and in its time.<p>To be fair, the author acknowledges most of that. The etymology was
interesting. Less so the intersection with &quot;class&quot; which is a weak
sociological concept in my opinion.<p>Ultimately I felt it was a cold analysis though. He struggles with
defining love other than a coincidence of four types plus sex, which I
think misses about 90% of what love is, including fancies and fevers
brought on by sunshine and hormones and quite opaque to reason.<p>There is something odd in reading any account of the passions that
attempts to be dispassionate.<p>While he mentions how some bonds mat break down, the types are mainly
presented as static, missing any discussion of events and shared
experiences that shape relationships, for example; military service
where a bunch of random dudes you accidently cohabit, hang-out and
take the piss with, quickly turn into brothers you&#x27;d die for and spend
the rest of your life drinking with.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37775570" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37775570" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#37774958">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37775306">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37776133">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774947">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37775570">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37775570">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Having no friends usually is associated with sadness but some people actually associate it with determination and ambition as “friends” are distractions.<p>Just a few years ago (5-10), it was popular in tech circles to claim basically &quot;I am hard worker because I did solitary hobby instead of socializing in school&quot;.

(I&#x27;m happy to hear about their life dramas, so long as they&#x27;re not unnecessary - which cuts down the drama list by a good 90-95%)<p>There are &quot;work friends&quot; who I may really enjoy the company of, and will probably miss when I or they leave the shared employer, but life gets in the way of keeping too large an entourage; if it&#x27;s unmanageable then it won&#x27;t be managed, aside from if they&#x27;d fit into the first category.<p>There are &quot;pity &#x2F; polite friends&quot; who, when we&#x27;re sharing a location I&#x27;ll happily talk to them because they&#x27;re good people and don&#x27;t deserve being ignored, but I do not and will not seek them out any other time.

I&#x27;d rather pay full price than owe a favour for a discount, especially if such favours are &quot;time spent with&quot; because of the emotional stamina thing.<p>Funny thing I find about the &quot;mutual interest friends&quot; is that I don&#x27;t have the depth of interest to discuss &quot;thing&quot; to the degree that these people do. I&#x27;ve actually found that entering a &quot;mutual interest group&quot;, to me, ends up as a discouragement of pursuit of that interest, lest I end up as deeply embedded in the rabbit hole as they.<p>I think I may be an arsehole (polite, but arsehole nonetheless).

It seems far too simplistic and superficial to be the state-of-the-art in sociology: terms like trust, confidence, outgroup, ingroup seem curiously absent. But I could easily be wrong about that, as I don&#x27;t know much about sociology in the first place.<p>But I do know a few things about linguistics, and I&#x27;m well aware that the oldest meaning of friend wasn&#x27;t &quot;ally&quot; in Rome. Amicus means &quot;loved one&quot;, and its application to allies is a mere Lakoffian metaphor, and by no means, as claimed by the article, the origin of the concept.<p>While recognizing the author&#x27;s expertise in sociology, when I take into account Gell-Mann amnesia, I was much less able to take his explanations seriously after that introduction. The writing style didn&#x27;t help either: it imitates that genre of 2010s SAT essays where the student has to demonstrate familiarity with the Western canon by strenously relating random events in books they read to inane questions such as &quot;Are people defined by their occupations?&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="37774910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37774910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Eisenstein</span><span>|</span><a href="#37774701">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37773934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37774910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37774910">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What about friends that you <i>love</i>?

I can only assume from his military childhood and university movements, that his friendships perhaps dont have the depth of trust others seek or have.

As soon as he described running into the green pixels problem, I knew he was going to learn something interesting. Sub-pixel structure, phosphor chromaticity, etc are such a fun rabbit hole to dive down. And it&#x27;s still highly relevant in today&#x27;s OLED, QLED, etc displays.<p>Also, a tip for when you play classic arcade or console retro games from the 80s and 90s: they will look <i>much</i> better (and be more authentic) if you play on a CRT - or, if playing via emulation, just turn on a CRT emulation pixel shader (CRT Royale is good). These pixels are art which the original devs and artists intentionally hand-crafted to use the way CRTs blend colors and scanlines anti-alias naturally. You deserve to see them as they were intended to be seen.

OLED and LCD are sample-and-hold screens, meaning they will display a frame for the entirety of a frame time, like 1&#x2F;60th of a second at 60 FPS. A CRT displays frames just for a fraction of the frame time (the rest of the time they are dark), which prevents perceptible blur when our eyes track moving objects, which they do all the time in order to prevent blur.

I&#x27;m not claiming CRTs are inherently &quot;better&quot; either technically or aesthetically. In general, they&#x27;re not. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> like some audiophiles who argue vinyl, tube amplification and &quot;magic copper&quot; cables are better - denying both signal theory (Nyquist et al) and objective data (double blind A&#x2F;B&#x2F;X tests). Modern digital formats and devices are almost always better overall. The cases where they aren&#x27;t are rare, very specific and, even then, &#x27;better-ness&#x27; is only in certain ways and not others.<p>My background is in video engineering and the point I&#x27;m making here is very specific. It only applies to hand-crafted retro game pixel art created in the CRT era. And my point isn&#x27;t even about CRTs! It&#x27;s about how the RS-170A composite video standard that CRTs used encodes color. The &quot;A&quot; in RS-170A added color to the existing black and white television standard while remaining compatible with old B&amp;W TVs. It was sort of a clever analog-era compression hack. I&#x27;ll skip the technical details and history here (but both are fascinating) and simplify the takeaway. Broadly speaking, in digital representations of composite video color encoding, the correct color of a pixel can only be known relative to the current phase of the pixel clock and the pixels adjacent to it. Sometimes it&#x27;s a fairly subtle difference but other times it can change a pixel from blue to red.<p>To be clear, this wasn&#x27;t &quot;better&quot; in any way (other than allowing optional color). The &quot;hack&quot; of encoding chroma information at half the frequency of luma and only in relation to a sub-carrier frequency came with trade-offs like chroma fringing on high frequency edges, ringing and other spurious artifacts. However, it was the only video we had and video game creators of the 80s &amp; 90s used the tech they had to create the best images they could. For example, we would put a pixel of a certain color next to a pixel of another color to intentionally change the color of the second pixel (and NOT just due to blurring the two together, it literally decoded to a different third color). I did this myself in the 1980s, intentionally positioning a white pixel next to a black pixel on an even numbered column so they would show as a single red pixel on the screen. Using this encoding technique, I could display 9 different colors from a computer that only had two bits per pixel. That&#x27;s why just displaying a naive RGB output of the game isn&#x27;t properly decoding a signal that was hand-encoded to have more and different data than what&#x27;s in the naive RGB.<p>So I recommend using a CRT shader not because it emulates a glass tube with phosphors but because it includes the decoding logic to correctly display the original encoded content. Personally, I never use the shaders that add noise, blurring, cross-talk or other degradation. That would be as dumb as adding the pops and click of a dirty vinyl LP to a pristine signal. That would make it <i>less</i> accurate. My goal as an engineer is to be more accurate. It&#x27;s fine if adding spurious crap tickles somebody&#x27;s nostalgia bone from when they were a kid - but I&#x27;d never do that. I want to to see the original pixels and colors the artists saw and intended their audiences to see. That requires properly decoding the signal. And the example I posted demonstrates just how different an image can appear when properly decoded.</div><br/><div id="42817980" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42817980" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dylan604</span><span>|</span><a href="#42815753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42816896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42817980">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42817980">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;It was sort of a clever analog-era compression hack.<p>Also known as technical debt around these parts.

The colors aren&#x27;t even there on the naive RGB image. This is because modern displays don&#x27;t properly decode the pixel pattern data as specified in the RS-170A analog video standard. A CRT shader can do many things including add blur, cross-talk, noise, scanlines, etc. But it ALSO does something else - properly decode the bit patterns in the first image to add the colors in the second image. The bit pattern was put there on purpose by the original artist&#x2F;dev. Not decoding it properly means the colors are wrong or missing.<p>Admittedly, this is an extreme example. Most games shown undecoded in naive RGB still have roughly the right number of pixels, in about the right colors, and in about the right places. So people accept it. But without composite decoding, some colors will be incorrect and some shades will be missing. It&#x27;s as objectively wrong as decoding surround sound improperly. I don&#x27;t care if you use a shader to &quot;Make it look more like a fuzzy-ass old screen.&quot; In fact, I&#x27;d prefer you didn&#x27;t. Adding excess blurring or noise just degrades pixels I worked hard on. But please, when you play games I wrote almost 40 years ago, I ask that you properly decode the color data I painstakingly encoded by hand and tested on a variety of different displays from Amdek monitors to cheap ass old TVs. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re not playing the games I wrote. You don&#x27;t have to buy a CRT. Shaders are free - and just a few clicks away. Use a high-quality one that just properly decodes composite and doesn&#x27;t add any degradation bullshit.<p>Note: those images are borrowed from this blog, which is a good discussion of composite video color encoding on the Apple II but the same principles apply to all analog composite video sources and displays. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-ii-composite-artifact-color-ntsc.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-ii-composi...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42818759" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42818759" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">egypturnash</span><span>|</span><a href="#42815753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817160">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817263">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817322">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42818759">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42818759">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sonic the Hedgehog, 1991.

We still get together and hang at places like the Hacker&#x27;s Conference and reminisce about hand-coding composite video pixels on 8-bit processors in assembly language. Good times.<p>Back in the day, we not only considered how the pixel data we put in memory would be displayed differently on screens, we had to iteratively test it because analog video output circuits weren&#x27;t always consistent between platforms (Woz made things a lot trickier by saving a nickel on the video output of the Apple II). Take a look at this <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-ii-composite-artifact-color-ntsc.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-ii-composi...</a><p>Part way down the page you&#x27;ll see a clear example of how we could put a specific pattern of black and white pixel data in memory that would cause the monitor to display 15 different colors. What we put in memory was not what the monitor displayed. And we wrote whole games this way. It also wasn&#x27;t just the Apple II. Every arcade board and computer system could have it&#x27;s own quirks. So, thinking about the blur, scanlines, and phosphors you mentioned was actually the easy part. The hard part was manipulating the display circuit in unnatural ways by hand-counting CPU cycles to display pixels in the &quot;off-limits&quot; overscan area or to switch display modes in the middle of a raster. There&#x27;s even a book about programming the Atari video system that&#x27;s literally called &quot;Racing the Beam&quot; (as in racing the electron beam scanning the CRT raster 59.94 times every second with the CPU). Most 80s games programmers had to know a lot about analog video signals. In fact, that&#x27;s how I eventually crossed over from computer programming to video engineering.</div><br/><div id="42817989" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42817989" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crazygringo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42815753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817800">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817441">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42817989">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42817989">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But these are different things -- color hacks and overscan or switching display modes are about circumventing known hardware limitations in predictable and clever ways.<p>The topic under discussion here is the pixel art -- the idea that the artist would be relying on a fixed amount of horizontal blur to get the amount of glint in the eye &quot;just right&quot;.

But we did bother. Most of us cared a lot about the pixels we made - maybe too much. We worked our asses off to make them as good as we could. It&#x27;s no different than when I worked in an audio mixing studio. We had four different sets of stereo speakers sitting on the console and tied to a switchbox. When we were getting close to the final mix, and certainly during all of the mastering process, we&#x27;d switch between the audiophile grade speakers to the K-Mart speakers to the shitty car speakers. Of course, it sounded better on the better speakers and there was much less clarity in the cheap speakers. But we needed to make sure it sounded good enough on the bad speakers. This was just the normal way content creators in the analog distribution era worked.<p>When making games I&#x27;d check the graphics on a good composite monitor but also on a TV through an RF switchbox. In the Amiga&#x2F;Atari ST era we checked on analog RGB too. Commodore 64s had optional S-Video output which looked very good compared to composite video and light years better than RF. We checked it all and created content with it in mind. In the analog era I worked in games, video production and audio production. And in all three I can recall specific instances where we worked on aspects we knew would probably only ever be appreciated by those with better gear. This was especially true with visual effects work we did for broadcast television. We added detail that we saw on the studio master tape but which a lot of people never saw at home (at least until home DVD re-issues became a thing). We hated the limitations of the current distribution standards and of the gear we authored on (even though it was the best money could buy at the time). And we struggled mightily to overcome those limitations and preserve every shred of quality we could.<p>Also, keep in mind that arcade cabinets weren&#x27;t variable like consumer TVs. They used very specific monitors which had specific, sometimes non-standard, refresh rates. I never worked at an arcade company but I knew people who did and they often had the bare monitor tube that would be in the cabinet right on their desk during development. And in that era we only ever saw our game graphics on composite displays. All our monitors were composite video, unless you were senior enough to have a 80x25 serial terminal (which were amber or green text only). On the quad-sync analog RGB display I have now in my arcade cabinet, I&#x27;ve installed around 40 specific modelines so that they exactly match the original vertical and horizontal frequency of the monitor in, for example, a Williams Joust cabinet when I&#x27;m playing Joust. The CRT I have was made by Wells Gardner, a company that specialized in making CRTs for arcade cabinet manufacturers like Atari, Sega, Namco, etc.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42817441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42817441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrandish</span><span>|</span><a href="#42815753">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42816896">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42817047">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42819604">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42817441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42817441">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">GP here.

I already explained the technical point about decoding the signal information properly in my other post but you&#x27;re making a different point about variability, so I&#x27;ll add that just because TVs could be mis-adjusted (or even broken) doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s not a technically correct way to display the encoded image data. This is why we used color bars to calibrate TVs.<p>&gt; I definitely appreciate wanting to blur the image in an emulator to remove the jaggies<p>But that&#x27;s not my point, blur was an undesirable artifact of the composite video standard. 80s and 90s 2D pixel art was hand-crafted knowing that the blur would blend some colors together, minimize interlace artifacts and soften hard edges. However, I only use shaders that model a small amount of blur and I run my CRT in analog RGB instead of composite, which can be quite sharp. My goal is not nostalgia for the analog past or to degrade a game&#x27;s output as much as my parent&#x27;s shitty 1970s living room TV did. I had to engineer analog video in that past - and I hated it&#x27;s shortcomings every day. When I play 80s and 90s video games, whether via shaders or on my analog RGB CRT, it probably looks quite a bit sharper and clearer than the original artists ever saw it - but that&#x27;s not due to some subjective up-res or up-scaling - it&#x27;s due to accurately decoding and displaying the original content to the technical standard it was created to comply with (even if many consumer TVs didn&#x27;t live up to that standard).<p>In the 90s I worked at a TV station and after hours we&#x27;d bring in consoles just to play them on the $3,000 Sony BVM broadcast reference monitor. And they looked great! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after. <i>Accurately</i> reflecting the original artist&#x27;s intent in the maximum possible quality - without slipping over the line into editorializing colors or pixels that were never in the original data in the first place. I want to play the game as it would have looked back in the day on the best video output available, through the best cable available and on the best screen money could buy. And via emulation and shaders, now everyone can have that experience!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42819604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42819604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">modeless</span><span>|</span><a href="#42815753">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42815834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42819604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42819604">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is awesome.

Learned a lot about color space and how it applies to subpixels, glad I watched this!<p>Gameplay wise, I think it should be a bigger game board and there should be accounting for the speed of the snake through each subpixel (when traveling left to right, going from R to G is less horizontal movement than going from B to R, and traveling vertically, each step is massive compared to the horizontal movement.) This should be pretty easy to do by ratio’ing and changing the speed of each animation step based on where in the spectrum it is. That would make it feel a lot more polished I think.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42816969" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42816969" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blibble</span><span>|</span><a href="#42815638">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42816914">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42816969">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42816969">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">qbasic nibbles did the same using the ansi box drawing characters<p>there was a text character with half the vertical &quot;cell&quot; in use<p>this, along with clever use of foreground&#x2F;background colours allowed double the vertical resolution (in text mode!)</div><br/></div></div><div id="42816914" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42816914" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">htk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42816969">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42816845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42816914">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42816914">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Who&#x27;s old enough to remember the joys of tweaking ClearType on Windows XP?<p>It was a great workaround for rendering smoother text on low dpi LCD displays.</div><br/><div id="42817909" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42817909" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shmeeed</span><span>|</span><a href="#42816914">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42816845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42817909">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42817909">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can still do that on Windows 10!

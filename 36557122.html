Similar to Eurodollars in the past yielding outsized interest rates, increasing demand and thus dollar outflows, this shows a (perhaps?) unrecognized accumulation in China, which may very well either allow them to essentially print their own dollars or mean that they already have been, synthetically.<p>The article has an interesting premise, calling it a problem for China to have cash - because China is an adversary. I&#x27;ve not seen this stated so explicitly in normal business news before. Warning of the potential for it to be invested abroad in the B&amp;R initiative really shows that the US is gearing up for great power competition again.<p>N.b.

This was a problem because they had a significant amount of our money. But they were also buying our debt. And so economists argued this was ok.<p>The doomsday scenario is this accumulation of reserve puts them in power to flood the market and cause significant devaluation. Or it causes them to make excessive loans and cause devaluation. Or it has leverage to threaten to do this and influence policy. Either way, this is a growing concern. It’s fine if a country knows and understands that concern.

First part of class was lecture, then we did practice assignments in class as groups, then there was out-of-class lecture videos and assignments.

Our high schools do a terrible job at preparing students for college. Just off the top of my head:<p>- High school classes are typically too easy<p>- So kids develop poor study habits which don&#x27;t serve them well for college material<p>- And most high school teachers are bad at getting kids excited about the subject because they&#x27;re exhausted themselves from babysitting and treat the work as a job. College professors can be bad at &quot;teaching&quot; but for different reasons (being researchers first and foremost). This disconnect in the reasons for bad education being different in environments is also not taught well to kids ahead of time (because who in this formula would? Requires good parenting or very self-conscious teachers at all levels).<p>There are definitely exceptions to this rule, but they are too few to solve the overarching problems.</div><br/><div id="38590191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abdullahkhalids</span><span>|</span><a href="#38589589">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590052">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590133">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590191">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; High school classes are typically too easy<p>The UK based O&#x2F;A system, which is used in many of the former colonies, is not as easy as the North American high school system. O levels is easy. But A levels content is almost as difficult as a typical first year university course.<p>Yet, students from those systems also face an equivalent huge shock when they switch to university. The reason is fundamentally different. In school, students are infantalized and their own education is not considered their responsibility. In university, nobody used to care whether you sank or swam. So students struggled. But that has changed quite a lot now. Many universities have almost a &quot;no child left behind&quot; policy - yes they do think child not adult who chose to attend university.<p>So even if students in the past used to attend office hours (I don&#x27;t know), today they don&#x27;t because it is no longer their responsibility to learn.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38590133" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590133" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Negitivefrags</span><span>|</span><a href="#38589589">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38589980">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590052">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590133">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590133">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an age thing, just maturity.<p>A type of maturity that develops much more slowly while being in the education system.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38590064" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590064" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LanternLight83</span><span>|</span><a href="#38589589">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38589980">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590133">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38590073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590064">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590064">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is very re-assuring as someone that&#x27;s been &quot;taking a gap year&quot; for as long as I wa in high-school</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38590073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38590073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k__</span><span>|</span><a href="#38589589">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38589869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38590073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38590073">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was lecturing software development for information design students.<p>Only 6 students signed up.<p>At least it was an optional class, so the students did it on purpose.<p>Still, it&#x27;s hard to teach new people from the ground up.

What I like about teaching is that your always get a new chance to improve your own teaching: the next period you try better or try a different approach and see what works best. The frustrating part is that students have a veto over what they learn, because &quot;you can lead a horse to the water but if they don&#x27;t drink, they don&#x27;t&quot;.

You can&#x27;t meet the needs of all students. Fortunately, your class is small, but even there you find that you can&#x27;t please them all (let alone a class of 300). And I write &quot;please&quot;, because that&#x27;s what you appear to be aiming at.<p>First, a course is there to convey knowledge and skills, not to please students. I&#x27;m not fond of hard rules in education, but some are simply right. Rule number one is: set the levels in advance: determine prerequisites and end goals. You may accept students outside the range, but it&#x27;s their risk to take a class that&#x27;s too easy or too hard, not your responsibility to overcome. You could always split it into multiple classes (basics and advanced), but that&#x27;s already setting yourself up for more work.<p>Second: try to use literature, books or articles, for material that takes too much time in class. It&#x27;s better that they come with questions than that they leave with questions. However, I&#x27;m aware this doesn&#x27;t work well, since students don&#x27;t read before class.<p>Third, I&#x27;m not teaching anymore, but my former colleagues and friends who teach and even direct programs, tell that the flipped classroom isn&#x27;t only a nebulous concept, it also doesn&#x27;t work. Covid has shown that. Developing a technically complex class that actually works is going to be very, very time consuming, and not rewarding at all. Cynically: when the department finds out you&#x27;re not actually physically teaching, they&#x27;ll assign you to something else. Or give your class to someone else.<p>Fourth, try to be interactive in class: explain, then give short, direct assignments. Your topic is unfortunately too complex to do anything meaningful during class, but perhaps you can ask them to look at some code and write down what it does, compare two different position evaluators, find out why a certain move can&#x27;t be returned by a certain algorithm, etc. The trick is to get them to actually work out and write down answers (and it can be wrong; there should be no scoring for these exercises), not wait for someone else to tell them, whether it&#x27;s you or the bright, interested student who&#x27;s going to pass anyway. Everyone should apply their full attention to the problem for a short time.<p>Another cynical remark: it seems you&#x27;re interested in knowledge transfer. You don&#x27;t get high ratings for that. If your school evaluates teachers based on student feedback, it&#x27;s a losing game. The only thing left, if you want to stay in that game, is to make it &quot;fun.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="38589797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38589797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beckthompson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38590179">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38589657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38589797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38589797">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would kill for a class like this at my college!

However, I noticed a stark contrast: many of my math friends consistently slept 9–10 hours a day. They needed that—not just to function in daily life but to achieve the deep focus required for their work. Living on less sleep might not affect immediate action (and in some cases, it might even seem to enhance focus on doing), but it can impair deeper, more complex thinking.<p>Some suggest that one of sleep&#x27;s key roles is to help the brain regenerate. Chronic sleep deprivation, in turn, is linked to a higher risk of dementia. For anecdotal evidence: Churchill and Thatcher, known for boasting about sleeping only 4–5 hours a night, experienced significant cognitive decline later in life.</div><br/><div id="42281916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42281916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42281611">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42281916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42281916">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; When I was younger, I was fascinated by various optimized sleep schedules.<p>I was also fascinated with alternate sleep schedules when I was younger.

Nobody who tried these had continued them very long. After going back to regular sleep schedules they felt significantly better. A common report was that they didn’t realize how badly sleep deprived they were until they stopped the alternate sleep schedule and went back to normal sleep.<p>A lot of the sleep biohacking reports follow a similar trend: People who try alternate methods of minimizing sleep don’t realize the negative effects until they quit.

I don&#x27;t think trying to reduce these is a good idea.<p>That means light sleep is the candidate for reduction. However, I have researched this before and the most consistent answer I get is that we don&#x27;t really know what the 5 hours spent in light sleep is for. It seems unlikely that it&#x27;s just for conserving energy, the body rarely does things for only one reason.<p>So my bet is that we might find a way to reduce light sleep by around 2 hours a night, which is what this article is suggesting. But it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll go much further without causing problems.

In his “social sleep hypothesis,” Samson suggests that our ancestors mitigated the risk of deep sleep by sleeping in large groups with at least one person on guard.<p>&gt; “Human camps are like a snail’s shell. They can pick it up and move it around with them,” Samson says. Our ancestral hunter-gatherers might have slept in groups of 15 to 20 around a campfire, taking turns staying awake and watching over the others.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;the-strange-sleeping-habits-of-homo-sapiens" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;the-strange-sl...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42280986" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42280986" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m0llusk</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280395">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280478">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42280986">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42280986">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Humans already sleep far less than other mammals, so that seems to be the case.

In my family, it’s very common to sleep in the six-hour range. I personally sleep from 10 pm to 4:25 am every day, often waking up around 4:15 am before my watch vibrates to wake me.<p>If I sleep eight hours, I feel groggy, jet-lagged, and generally have a day where I’m slogging through molasses to get from one task to the next.<p>My wife has raised concerns about my sleep pattern, so I started using sleep-tracking tools like Fitbit and, more recently, an Apple Watch. She tracks her sleep too, and the big difference we’ve noticed is that I fall asleep within about two minutes, and my “sleep efficiency” using these tools is 98%. If I’m traveling and feel a bit jet-lagged, I can take a 20-minute nap (often without an alarm) and wake up feeling refreshed. She also seems to wake up a lot, most nights I &quot;sleep like a log&quot; and I only wakeup in the morning.<p>My mother has the same pattern but stays up later and sleeps about six hours into the morning. I used to do this too, but around age 23, I switched to an earlier bedtime and a consistent daily routine. When I became a “morning person,” I found I could code like crazy in the morning before “starting” my day, and this rewarding experience reinforced the habit.<p>I’ve tested this pattern in many ways, including not using an alarm (I still wake up around the same time for weeks at a time) and using a “light clock” I built with a Raspberry Pi to slowly brighten the room. Again, I wake up after roughly 6 hours and 20 minutes. Now, I use my Apple Watch to vibrate as a gentle reminder to start the day. On weekends, I keep the same schedule and use the extra time to read or hack away at side projects, often coding until the late afternoon when my wife protests enough that I need to stop and hang out or do my honey-do&#x27;s.<p>About 10 years ago, during my annual checkup, my wife asked my doctor about this sleep pattern. The doctor asked me several questions, seemingly looking for signs of sleep deficit or dysfunction. In the end, he said I could do a sleep study but concluded, “If it works, don’t break it.”<p>As for productivity, I’ve found I can code effectively from 4:30 am to 8:30 am, then shower and work from 9 am to 6 pm without much trouble. I also practice intermittent fasting, typically eating only at 6 pm, with a protein shake around noon. This habit happened by accident—I realized breakfast slowed me down, and eating lots of carbs impaired my cognitive function and ability to code or handle complex tasks in the morning.<p>Before you ask, I generally don’t use caffeine or other stimulants. Occasionally, I’ll have one cup of coffee around 9 am as a social habit, but I recently stopped that again and actually feel better. I’ll most likely drop it again for a while until it sneaks back in again.</div><br/><div id="42285624" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42285624" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joveian</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280870">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42281237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42285624">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42285624">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing!

There are a couple of ways to use melatonin and for circadian use a small non-delayed dose earlier may be better (or use both):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circadiansleepdisorders.org&#x2F;treatments.php#melatonin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circadiansleepdisorders.org&#x2F;treatments.php#melatonin</a><p>I have had issues waking up more frequently when taking melatonin.  It sounds like while not common this side effect is not that rare either.  Based on my severe sleep issues (primarly circadian) I suspect that one part of &quot;sleep issues&quot; for many people is actualy waking up issues and that the detailed process around waking up has a bigger influence than is currently appreciated.  I suspect one reason that melatonin is helpful is that it sets the stage for a better wake up, however if something causes this wake up procedure to start after not enough sleep it can be more difficult to get back to sleep.  The delayed release seems to help quite a bit to limit the chance of this happening for me, although it does still happen at times.  I&#x27;m not sure if melatonin is a particularly good option for staying asleep.<p>Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t particulary good options.  Magnesium is the easiest and as effective as anything for me but unfortunately a high enough dose to be effective will also make me tired the next day.  However, if your diet is low on magnesium then just increasing that some might help or possibly you won&#x27;t have the issue with tiredness the next day.  baclofen helps me but has issues and I certainly would not recommend it for your case.<p>A short (few minutes) nap mid day helps the circadian rhythm but longer naps can make it harder to stay asleep at night.  If you nap for longer periods, multiple times, or later in the day that is the first thing I would suggest changing.  I&#x27;m not sure what length causes more trouble but I think getting to sleep but staying asleep as briefly as you easily can is the ideal (though if you will naturally wake up after a bit longer that might be better than an alarm).<p>I also noticed covid made my already bad sleep worse when I had it (most likely covid, not confirmed by test; cold or flu usually give me better sleep for a day or two).  However, I didn&#x27;t notice any lasting issues (I still have severe sleep issues but it was just that first week of covid that they seemed to be different from usual).  I wonder if it could be just your memory of how you sleep that changed after you noticed it due to the disruption.  As long as you can easily get back to sleep and aren&#x27;t staying awake for long it should not cause trouble and is not uncommon.  If you feel rested there is nothing to fix while worrying about it or trying to change it could case worse trouble.<p>These are my thoughts anyway, hopefully something in there is helpful :).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42280546" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42280546" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">renewiltord</span><span>|</span><a href="#42281643">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42280546">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42280546">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is it really possible?

As someone with clinically-diagnosed insomnia, I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to&#x2F;unfortunate enough to have to try the orexin receptor antagonist sleep aids for a while.

They really, really do work.

Orexin receptor antagonists? They work. Holy crap, do they ever work. Sleep quality better than the Z-drugs, great tolerability, no massive disruption going off them... when these things go off-patent they&#x27;re going to be massive. Sleep quality was not perfect (maybe 80% of &quot;normal&quot;? I don&#x27;t know) but that is absolutely minor compared to the alternative.<p>(And for the record, I&#x27;m off them now due to other stuff clearing up such that I don&#x27;t need this level of sleep assistance anymore. Not because I can&#x27;t afford them.)<p>I guess that&#x27;s a long-winded way to say that if you&#x27;re going to do questionably-advised sleep biohacking, orexin receptors are probably the place to start.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42279967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nosefurhairdo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280428">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For the afficionados, there&#x27;s an excellent paper titled &quot;The neurobiological basis of narcolepsy&quot; published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience which examines the relationship between orexin and sleep as it relates to narcolepsy patients: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6492289&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6492289&#x2F;</a><p>In narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), patients have severely diminished orexin levels.

Homo sapiens mitigated sleeping on the ground as a risk by sleeping in groups.<p>&gt; However, too much deep sleep is dangerous. REM is the stage of sleep in which we experience dreams, so our muscles become paralyzed to avoid acting out these dreams. In his “social sleep hypothesis,” Samson suggests that our ancestors mitigated the risk of deep sleep by sleeping in large groups with at least one person on guard.<p>&gt; “Human camps are like a snail’s shell. They can pick it up and move it around with them,” Samson says. Our ancestral hunter-gatherers might have slept in groups of 15 to 20 around a campfire, taking turns staying awake and watching over the others.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;the-strange-sleeping-habits-of-homo-sapiens" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;the-strange-sl...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42279949" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279949" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">worksonmymach</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280395">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280204">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279949">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279949">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why is it not a survival advantage?

But lately I’ve been gaining back my time and pushing even further - once every one or two weeks I’ll skip a night of sleeping, staying up around 36 hours straight. I’ve been doing this for a few months now and have zero side effects so far.

Long term it gets exhausting but this perceptually becomes the new normal, especially when the symptoms of this kind of sleep deprivation aren&#x27;t that obviously tied to sleep habits, the naively expected ones being masked by external pressure (schedule),  habit bias (normalisation of deviance through repetition), exogenic (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine) or endogenic (adrenalin, cortisol, dopamine).<p>The main problem is then that by the time symptoms are impacting the situation is deeply anchored; worse, because the root cause is non-obvious it is often misdiagnosed.<p>Don&#x27;t ask me how I know.<p>Also, not a physician, just saying: take care.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42280068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42280068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">colordrops</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280072">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280051">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42280068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42280068">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My first reaction is to wonder what the downside of such a gene is.

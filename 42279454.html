As someone with clinically-diagnosed insomnia, I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to&#x2F;unfortunate enough to have to try the orexin receptor antagonist sleep aids for a while. As recent, on-patent drugs, they are very, <i>very</i> expensive ($360&#x2F;month was the number marked on the receipt slip, not that that means much in the US; I certainly wasn&#x27;t paying that)... and they work. They really, really do work. I was prescribed them because I tried <i>every single other class of</i> sleep aid on the market and they were mostly ineffective, had massive side effects, or were benzos (temazepam: best sleep of my life, but better not use it for longer than a month!).<p>This stuff? Orexin receptor antagonists? They work. Holy crap, do they ever work. Sleep quality better than the Z-drugs, great tolerability, no massive disruption going off them... when these things go off-patent they&#x27;re going to be massive. Sleep quality was not perfect (maybe 80% of &quot;normal&quot;? I don&#x27;t know) but that is absolutely minor compared to the alternative.<p>(And for the record, I&#x27;m off them now due to other stuff clearing up such that I don&#x27;t need this level of sleep assistance anymore. Not because I can&#x27;t afford them.)<p>I guess that&#x27;s a long-winded way to say that if you&#x27;re going to do questionably-advised sleep biohacking, orexin receptors are probably the place to start.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42279967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42279967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nosefurhairdo</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280428">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280374">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42279967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42279967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For the afficionados, there&#x27;s an excellent paper titled &quot;The neurobiological basis of narcolepsy&quot; published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience which examines the relationship between orexin and sleep as it relates to narcolepsy patients: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6492289&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6492289&#x2F;</a><p>In narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), patients have severely diminished orexin levels.

In his âsocial sleep hypothesis,â Samson suggests that our ancestors mitigated the risk of deep sleep by sleeping in large groups with at least one person on guard.<p>&gt; âHuman camps are like a snailâs shell.

These days I naturally sleep for 8 hours. It&#x27;s not completely wasted; my brain often figures out difficult problems while I sleep. But if I could do something relaxing like playing a game or socialising instead that would be great.<p>I did try polyphasic sleep when I was younger but it didn&#x27;t work out. Having my sleeping patterns so far off the standard made me really unhappy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42280199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42280199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">clumsysmurf</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280422">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42280199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42280199">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recently this came up on sleep deprivation :<p>&quot;preemptive administration of low-dose aspirin during sleep restriction reduced pro-inflammatory responses.

But lately Iâve been gaining back my time and pushing even further - once every one or two weeks Iâll skip a night of sleeping, staying up around 36 hours straight. Iâve been doing this for a few months now and have zero side effects so far.

Long term it gets exhausting but this perceptually becomes the new normal, especially when the symptoms of this kind of sleep deprivation aren&#x27;t that obviously tied to sleep habits, the naively expected ones being masked by external pressure (schedule),  habit bias (normalisation of deviance through repetition), exogenic (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine) or endogenic (adrenalin, cortisol, dopamine).<p>The main problem is then that by the time symptoms are impacting the situation is deeply anchored; worse, because the root cause is non-obvious it is often misdiagnosed.<p>Don&#x27;t ask me how I know.<p>Also, not a physician, just saying: take care.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42280068" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42280068" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">colordrops</span><span>|</span><a href="#42280072">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42280051">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42280068">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42280068">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My first reaction is to wonder what the downside of such a gene is.

When I have to lift something awkward (eg, furniture), I don&#x27;t injure myself. If you can deadlift 200KG, awkwardly leaning over your lawn mower to grab a 20KG bag of concrete is pretty easy.<p>3. It is really really handy being able to move heavy things.<p>4.

For what it was worth, she was Starting Strength certified and a successful international masters competitor. She fixed a subtle problem with my deadlift using nothing but the wrinkles on my T-shirt; my recovery improved dramatically.<p>At 40, I was stronger than I was as a high school wrestler. I <i>loved</i> lifting. I remember casually picking up a piece of equipment that took two burly guys to lift and jumping down from a pickup with it.<p>But over the course of several years, I picked up several small but persistent  injuries lifting. Two can be worked around. One makes it very hard to squat for more than a few weeks of training. None of the injuries, fortunately, affects me noticeably in daily life. But I&#x27;ll never wide-grip bench press again, either.<p>When I was coming to terms with these injuries, I had a long talk with the oldest natty lifters in my gym. The powerlifers were all dealing with various chronic injuries. (Seriously, Rippetoe has published a bit of his medical history. He&#x27;s a <i>mess</i> of injuries.)<p>But you know who was still lifting in their 60s and even 70s, injury-free for decades at a stretch? The bodybuilders. One of the oldest looked over at me one day, and said, &quot;You know, I don&#x27;t like the risk&#x2F;reward on heavy squats. You do them flawlessly for years, and then one day, a group of muscle fibers decides to misfire for a moment when you&#x27;re under the bar.&quot;<p>So, enjoy Starting Strength, or whatever other beginner program Reddit likes this year.  And the two Starting Strength certified coaches I&#x27;ve known were <i>excellent.</i> Good technique is absolutely worth it. But once you&#x27;ve gotten those sweet beginner gains, talk to the old lifters, and think long and hard about where you want to go next. Because <i>nothing</i> is as important as remaining injury-free. And every older powerlifter I met was dealing with chronic injuries.<p>Once gains get difficult, think about what you really want out of lifting.</div><br/><div id="37206798" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37206798" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oarfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#37206025">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206637">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37206798">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37206798">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your experience is surely valid, but I wouldn&#x27;t just generalize this to the population at large.<p>When you say &quot;powerlifters&quot;, are those people who compete or just people who train?

It&#x27;s good for getting people into lifting, but Starting Strength has a powerlifting fetish for no good reason, and the advice to aggressively gain weight is also not appropriate for everyone (GOMAD etc.).
Then recently I saw a Starting Strength video in which they claimed that the really grindy reps at the end of the set are the ones that make all the difference (for strength anyway), which as far as I&#x27;m aware is false and probably harmful, as you can do way more training volume with less risk of injury (I would expect) if you keep some reps away from failure.</div><br/><div id="37206885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37206885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zemvpferreira</span><span>|</span><a href="#37206025">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206798">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37206885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37206885">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can review myself in ekidd&#x27;s experience.

My worst injury as a beginner 10+ years ago was to finish a deadlift routine after feeling a muscle slightly pulled after the first rep, I had a bad lower back pain for weeks that left me uncomfortable doing anything: laying down, sitting, walking, etc.<p>If you don&#x27;t know any bodybuilders I&#x27;d recommend getting a good coach on your beginner phase to fix your form, you don&#x27;t need to keep a coach after you learn the basics, and bad form is the #1 source of injuries at lowest levels. Starting Strength is a decent beginner routine but over time you&#x27;ll want to add some auxiliary exercises to work smaller muscles, in my routine I like to start the training session with big lifts (deadlift, squat, standing barbell rows, chin ups&#x2F;pull ups, bench press, and overhead presses) and after those I follow with auxiliary movements (face pulls, dumbbell presses&#x2F;curls, calves, etc.).<p>I chose to not push myself past a level I got comfortable with, never tried a deadlift heavier than 220kg, my squats hover between 130-140kg, bench press around 80kg, military press around 55-60kg.

Consistency over time is the biggest point of failure in making progress, and the aim is to lower the barrier as far as possible to starting and staying consistent.<p>The point of a beginner program <i>really</i> isn&#x27;t the volume moved or optimizing the particular split, but to give the beginner a structure on which to build routine and learn good habits. It helps no one to crap on Starting Strength, when it has an established history of achieving exactly that goal. Offering things like the reddit program as a potentially superior alternative is fine to the eager newbie, but telling people that Starting Strength is a bad way to start is just counterproductive.<p>My advice to every new lifter is that the best program for them is the one that gets them going back to the gym consistently, and I&#x27;ll continue to stand behind that.

Go to gym - find heavy stuff you can pick up - try not to do anything stupid.<p>SS is great because it has a low number of movements, volume is irrelevant when you get sore from a barbell squat, learning how to lift is deceptively complicated (breathing&#x2F;bracing&#x2F;muscle activation).<p>The article keeps straw-manning &quot;longterm&quot; this and that - SS is your first year in the gym (or less). By the time you&#x27;re trough with it, unless you&#x27;re totally oblivious, you&#x27;ll pick up on other stuff when <i>you have the time</i>. And you&#x27;ll have a decent intuition of how to lift, understand recovery implications, consistency in training, and a decent base strength. It&#x27;s a great base to get you started and have an achievable progression framework that doesn&#x27;t require much tutoring or time.<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people get from 0 to nice lifting strength in ~1 year by doing SS. The only thing that&#x27;s relevant is consistency - if you come in 2-3x a week and do something difficult for an hour for a year - you will see results - it can be total fucking around - you will still get results. It&#x27;s good to start with SS type exercises because those well defined movements target your entire body, and if you learn to execute them correctly you reduce your chance of injury.<p>TL;DR - for any newbie out there that&#x27;s in bad shape and looking to start gym - save yourself time and avoid &quot;optimal muscle development&quot; crowd. None of those arguments apply to you and are completely irrelevant. Don&#x27;t trust me ? Go to the gym and do 5x5 with an empty bar and see if you&#x27;re sore after the workout.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37206363" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37206363" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">renewiltord</span><span>|</span><a href="#37206025">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206108">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206399">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37206285">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37206363">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37206363">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ultimately, while I never reached the 200 kg &#x2F; 440 lb he mentions on the deadlift I got to: (in lbs)<p>Back Squat 275 2 rm<p>Front Squat 225 2 rm<p>Deadlift 375 2 rm<p>Bench 175 5x5<p>OHP 135 5x5<p>C&amp;J 125 1x5<p>Snatch 105 1x5<p>With my primary program being SS and then SS like (do the set 5x5 or appropriate at the work weight, advance by appropriate increment).

Squatting incorrectly made them hurt, but I went to see a sports PT and he taught me how to squat correctly (I was overloading my quads and not using my posterior chain like...at all - a proper low-bar squat with the glutes engaged was a total gamechanger), and not only did it fix my knee pain in squats, it fixed my knee pain in general. I went from being functionally crippled in my 20s to competing as an amateur powerlifter and training Brazilian jiujitsu in my late 30s, and I absolutely attribute the foundation of that to squatting and deadlifting.<p>In my personal experience, as a now more seasoned lifter, most people have knee pain in squats because they load the quads and arrest the squat early with the quads rather than hitting full depth. Once your hip crease is below the top of your kneecap, your quads are no longer bearing the load! If you&#x27;re stopping the lift prior to that, then you&#x27;re applying a ton of torque to the knee directly with the quad, rather than letting the much more robust posterior chain absorb the energy of the descent.<p>If you haven&#x27;t tried squatting low-bar, you might give it a go - it makes it much easier to move with the posterior chain. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bs_Ej32IYgo">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bs_Ej32IYgo</a> is my single favorite squat video on the internet.

Then my knee started randomly buckling when I would walk.<p>So I started filming myself. I also used TUBOW [3] to figure out that my knees were drifting far too forward.

One of my disabilities is myopia, which limits the activity of &quot;seeing.&quot;  My learning disability limits my ability to process visual-spatial information.<p>Without accommodation in certain tasks, I absolutely <i>am</i> disabled.

The good news is that this isn&#x27;t chronic (what the physiotherapist told me). After you heal, just take care to be stretched and warmed up before putting repetitive stress on your tendons.<p>Edit: When you are injured, the rest of your body has to put itself under extra stress when you move to offset the lack of mobility that the tendonitis causes. So you increase the probability of other injuries (in my case, the tightening of other tendons).

But that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg. At least one study found that about 60 percent of people would benefit from better accommodation if you ask them if they have difficulties with X without asking them to self-identify as <i>disabled</i>.<p>Both the officially <i>disabled</i> and people with milder limitations get really cranky about where to draw that line. People with mild limitations often go out of their way to say they are definitely <i>not</i> disabled and merely have a little trouble with these things and officially <i>disabled</i> jealously guard the label because they need it to have any hope of making their lives work at all and don&#x27;t want people who can make their lives work without that label horning in on any limited benefits available only to them or diluting what the word means.<p>It&#x27;s a really thorny topic.<p>I had a class from SFSU in <i>Homelessness and Public Policy</i> and it has a similar exercise, like &quot;Spend one day pretending you are homeless. Figure out how to go to the bathroom while carrying everything you own. Figure out how you will get around without a car.&quot;<p>And then I spent nearly six years homeless.<p>There are plenty of people with actual disabilities who are perfectly capable of telling you what they need if you will only listen to them. If you are unable or unwilling to listen to them and take them seriously without trying to &quot;walk a mile in their shoes,&quot; well, sure, go ahead and try it out for a week or whatever if you think that will help you.<p>But sometimes all it takes is one person willing to say it over and over so you keep it in mind when it&#x27;s time for you to make coding decisions or whatever. And if&#x2F;when that happens, it probably won&#x27;t ever get noticed, acknowledged nor appreciated.<p>It will promptly be forgotten like when programmers of an old, &quot;useless&quot; language fixed Y2K and the world did not have a global financial meltdown on January 1, 2000. We shrugged, acted like &quot;Someone must have been wrong.&quot; and moved on to hand-wringing about the newest bad news.<p>I am probably the only person on the planet who sometimes goes &quot;Thank God we aren&#x27;t living in the Y2K Post Apocalypse!&quot;<p>The internet has made my life as a disabled person vastly more workable. Are there things I wish were even betterer? Sure, there are and we certainly shouldn&#x27;t be dismissing the completely valid complaints of anyone who can&#x27;t do x because it&#x27;s not designed with their needs in mind and there is no means whatsoever to get it done.<p>I certainly do not dismiss such people.<p>But perhaps it would help to understand that when they complain about, for example, the internet not working for them, part of what they are telling you is that the internet is vital to their lives and has expanded their life beyond what it likely would have been in decades past. So when it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s like taking away their oxygen or sunshine.<p>It&#x27;s hard to do anything well. It&#x27;s often <i>not</i> appreciated <i>at all</i> nor rewarded.

But also perhaps more nuanced. Many people see disability as a purely negative experience, something to avoid at all costs, synonymous with illness. But it is a slightly different axis: Both medical and societal in nature. Thus we have the idea that it is not the person who is disabled, but society that <i>disables</i> the person. And separately many people have it as a central part of their identity, something to be proud of. Hence identity first language: “disabled person” vs “person with disability”. I am a person who holds it both as a burden of sorts, but also an identity, and a constantly fluctuating commentary on the ableism in the way we’ve built society.

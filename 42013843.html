In 2024, you also have to compare against podcasts &amp; Youtube. Beyond simply starting your own content channels, there&#x27;s a speaker circuit for interview format podcasts, who have the audience and logistics already nailed down.<p>Using the author&#x27;s own criteria:<p>1. Coordination. Podcasts solve this by fitting into various niches. Audiences self-select by topic pretty effectively. Expert speakers can easily see various proxies for audience: downloads, ratings, subscriptions, comments, etc, and review past guests and topics for matching suitability. Whereas with this conference you really have no idea about the audience size.<p>2. Distillation. Most podcasts I listen to are an interview between a host and a series of subject matter experts. This format substantially lowers the participation barrier for the expert: hop on a webex and chat for 60 minutes. On YouTube I think there&#x27;s probably room for an &quot;invited talks&quot; format, like a tight ten - fifteen minutes on a topic, without the usual banter. Arguably HYTRADBOI is a concentrated version of that, but none of the videos are findable anywhere other than it&#x27;s own site, and hasn&#x27;t really seen traction on HN. Which brings up to...<p>3. Serendipity. YouTube kinda does this by default, though admittedly watching a KubeCon video is likely to recommend another KubeCon vid that was uploaded at the same time than something from a different tech conf.<p>The author seems to lean heavily on the value of community chat but frankly, annual conference communities are kinda bad at it. Either there&#x27;s too many people trying to talk to The Expert or not enough and the moderator has to beg for participation. I kinda prefer the discord &#x2F; slack &#x2F; IRC 24x7x365 community discussion model, where there&#x27;s more incentives to help each other out versus the transactional conference window after which you will likely never see these people again.</div><br/><div id="42014853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42014853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jamii</span><span>|</span><a href="#42014728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014150">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42014853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42014853">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with some of this.<p>My experience of tech podcasts though has been that it&#x27;s often the same old people being interviewed, and that a 60 minute interview is often less interesting than a 10 minute talk where the speaker spent a bunch of time thinking about how to explain a subject. The latter is definitely more work, but I&#x27;ve had no problem finding speakers.<p>Outside of tech, I&#x27;ve seen a few podcasts avoid this pattern. The host of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcast.clearerthinking.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcast.clearerthinking.org&#x2F;</a> is really good at picking interesting speakers, preparing questions, ans gently but persistently pushing back when they try to gloss over a weak point in their argument. I&#x27;d love to listen to a tech version of that podcast.<p>Not being on youtube might be a mistake. I definitely don&#x27;t want to use youtube for the conference itself because I don&#x27;t want attendees to have to sit through ads. But maybe I should mirror to youtube afterwards. I&#x27;ll think about it.<p>The chat at the last hytradboi was pretty dense. That may have been down to having quite a high ratio of experts in the audience though. I&#x27;m not sure if that will continue to be the case.<p>I have mixed experiences with discords. The persistence is much better for community building, but in big discords it&#x27;s rare to have an actual conversation because everyone is only half paying attention. The ones that do feel interesting are again the ones with a high ratio of experts who are actively engaged in the subject. Or small invite-only discords that also hold regular mini-confs, which is maybe a kind of sweet spot.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not tied to running a conference. Last time was kind of a whim, but people enjoyed it and wanted to do it again. So this post is less an argument in favor of conferences and more me trying to figure out what I accidentally did right so I can do more of it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42014150" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42014150" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voidfunc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42014728">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013849">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42014150">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42014150">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To redistribute wealth from pockets of fools and corporations willing to pay.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42013849" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013849" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jamii</span><span>|</span><a href="#42014150">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014235">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013849">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013849">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bangbangcon.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bangbangcon.com&#x2F;</a> also had some interesting answers to this question.

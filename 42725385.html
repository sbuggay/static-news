There are numerous products I likely would have purchased, but I either find a substitute or just go without because I won&#x27;t play the stupid &quot;let&#x27;s get on a call&quot; game.<p>If your website doesn&#x27;t give me enough information to:<p>1.  Know enough about your product to know that it will (generally speaking) meet my needs&#x2F;requirements.<p>2.  Know that the pricing is within the ballpark of reasonable given what your product does.<p>Then I will move on (unless I&#x27;m really desparate, which I assure you is rarely the case).  I&#x27;ve rolled-my-own solution more than once as well when there were no other good competitors.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that calls never work or don&#x27;t have a place, because they definitely do.  The key to using the call successfully (with me at least) is to use the call to get into true <i>details</i> about my needs, <i>after</i> I know that you&#x27;re at least in the ballpark.  Additionally, the call should be done <i>efficiently</i>.  We don&#x27;t need a 15 minute introduction and overview about you.  We don&#x27;t need a bunch of small talk about weather or sports.  2 minutes of that is ok, or when waiting for additional people to join the call, but beyond that I have things to do.<p>I know what my needs are.  I understand you need some context on my company and needs in order to push useful information forward, and I also understand that many potential customers will not take the lead in asking questions and providing that context, but the sooner you take the temperature and adjust, the better.  Also, you can get pretty far as a salesperson if you just spend 5 minutes looking at our website before the call!  Then you don&#x27;t have to ask basic questions about what we do.  If you&#x27;re willing to invest in the time to get on a call, then it&#x27;s worth a few minutes of time before-hand to look at our website.</div><br/><div id="42728440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42728440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freedomben</span><span>|</span><a href="#42728008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42735376">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42728440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42728440">[45 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh I might add another huge thing:  Have a way to justify&#x2F;explain your pricing and how you came to that number.

Explaining to them that it runs in a serverless function on-demand was fun, especially because they would say things like, &quot;well, what&#x27;s your average?&quot;  I would often reply and say my average is defined by a function where you take the number of active users (which itself is highly elastic) and calculate for average runtime at 4 cores per user for approximately 50 ms per page (which page count is highly elastic too) and sum to get &quot;average core use per month&quot;.

Everybody says they want simple pricing, which often aligns to seats or MAU - but then they want usage-based pricing, but then they&#x27;re concerned about unpredictable costs and spiky usage.<p>Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch - you can have simple and predictable but you will have some users that you pay for that aren&#x27;t getting value.  You can have usage-based billing, but then you run the risk that anyone who uses an antipattern for the product will suddenly cost you a ton (or consume all of their allocated quota and be dead in the water, which is differently bad).<p>The more flexibility you offer, the more complexity you&#x27;re putting onto customers and sales teams to understand what&#x27;s the best way for them to consume the software.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of market pressure to &quot;follow the crowd&quot; - even if you have an option that is (in your mind) more customer friendly&#x2F;favorable, if you are structuring your pricing differently than the competition, there will be customers who are concerned that they&#x27;re not getting &quot;a good deal&quot; or concerned that the structure will end up being less favorable to them over time (after all, why does everybody ELSE do it this other way?).  Sales reps also prefer pricing strategies that are at least structurally consistent with other products on the market, because it makes their lives easier.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s very difficult to change pricing nad packaging later on - changing price is relatively simple, but changing units of billing or retiring an old offering can be an extremely difficult task.<p>(disclaimer: these are just my own opinions, everything is hard)</div><br/><div id="42732643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42732643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlotOfReading</span><span>|</span><a href="#42728008">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42731526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42731262">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42732643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42732643">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve seen companies square this circle with capped hybrid billing strategies.

You assume each user or unit of usage is going to cost you X&#x2F;unit and you charge X+Y.  There is inevitably going to be a distribution of users and their usage patterns and costs, and the 90% percentile is probably going to be 5X, and the 10% is probably going to be .2X.  There&#x27;s not any malice there, it&#x27;s just that different users have different usage scenarios and they use the product differently.<p>Another reason relates to the issues with usage-based billing. Even in that scenario, whatever usage dimension you measure on will have users that don&#x27;t fit the profile and they still end up being subsidized (from a margins perspective) by  customers that DO map to the profile.  A really naive example - you&#x27;re a database company, you want to be cheap for people to get started, you go with usage based billing and charge based on storage.  For most customers, that works - assuming your product value is apparent and differentiated, I think most people would understand that &quot;I have to pay more because I&#x27;m storing more data, and accessing that data can be more expensive, queries more complex, and the utiltiy that I get from the database scales as the quantity of storage increases&quot;.  Great, usage based billing, let&#x27;s do it.<p>But - then you have users who store very small amounts of data but with incredibly high query volumes.  Your options are to either just eat the cost of those users (which might be fine for some amount of time) or now start to add additional dimensions on which you meter usage.  So now you charge for storage AND cpu time AND maybe concurrent connections if that&#x27;s a problem AND bandwidth. Congratulations, you have now created the perfect usage-based billing model, which perfectly assigns customer charges to handle the multitude of usage patterns that customers experience.<p>BUT, it&#x27;s really complicated to explain to people, and it&#x27;s really complex to predict costs.  That has two implications, one of which is that your value proposition has to be increasingly compelling as complexity increases.  To use the database example, at some point someone at a customer will say &quot;honestly, wouldn&#x27;t it be more predictable if we just spun up a couple of VMs and ran a database instance ourselves?&quot;.  Complex usage-based pricing works if you&#x27;ve got incredible technology that would be difficult to impossible for a customer to deploy themselves, but if your value prop is convenience and&#x2F;or abstraction, you&#x27;re diminishing that value as you make the pricing model increasingly less convenient and less abstract.<p>The other factor is that someone has to build and manage the metering of all of these things.  Even a single dimension like storage is complicated - how do I bill for additional storage?  Do I look at the total storage at the end of the month and multiply by X?  That hurts users who, say, run end of month batch jobs - but for you, users that use huge amounts of temporary space and then free them before the end of the month, that hits your bottom line (depending on your own architecture).  So maybe you want to charge on a daily basis, but now every problem gets more complicated.<p>Then, if you extend that across multiple billing dimensions, it&#x27;s just gotten harder and more complicated.  Now it&#x27;s rock and a hard place time - you can stick to one abstract usage measure that is easy to reason about, but you&#x27;re inevitably going to have some users that underpay based on that usage measure and some that overpay.  Or you can add more dimensions and make things more &quot;fair&quot;, but everybody&#x27;s lives are harder, both for the customer and for you and your team.<p>When you give customers automatic optimization, you get the worst of both worlds - you make less money on the bottom 10% (usage-wise) of users&#x2F;customers because they end up falling into the usage based billing, and you make less money on the top 10% because there is capped upside for you as the provider.  For customers, sure, it saves them money, but what you&#x27;re really giving them is a price cap (not to exceed X).<p>I would say for the sales teams, it&#x27;s also not great, because they have all of the challenges of explaining two different models.  For enterprises, it&#x27;s a mess because 1) they&#x27;ll probably want to negotiate specific billing terms for their use cases (we don&#x27;t want to pay X for bandwidth, we want to pay Y) and other structural terms, all of which your billing system needs to support.<p>At the end of the day, however you charge for anything is an abstraction layer on top of your costs.  That&#x27;s true if you charge per user, or per object, or per gig, or per connection, or whatever else.  It&#x27;s all unit-based pricing even if it&#x27;s not <i>usage</i>-based procing.  You have to decide how much work you want your engineers, customers, salespeople, etc. to do in order to build, explain, and understand how much someone will pay for software.<p>My general advice is to pick the simplest pricing model that protects your margins and prevents abuse.  For infrastructure-y products, things like storage, compute, network, are all reasonable meters.  For SaaS products for business users, per-user pricing is well-understood, and there are things you can do if you really want to apply a usage-based element there (bill based on MAU, or have a MAU component separate from seats purchased).  But there&#x27;s really only two scenarios - you pick a small number of meters and understand that some customers will subsidize other customers, or you meter across a bunch of dimensions that align to your costs and create a lot of complexity for your customers.  Blending the two gives you worse margins and the complexity of both options combined.</div><br/><div id="42733831" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42733831" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AlotOfReading</span><span>|</span><a href="#42728008">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42733274">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42731262">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42733831">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42733831">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, it&#x27;s worse for margins. However, we&#x27;re in a thread about how potential customers don&#x27;t want to risk either spending lots of money for services they won&#x27;t use or dealing with spikes. Not choosing one or the other inherently puts the cost on the provider, shrinking margins.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an especially hard model to understand though. It&#x27;s commonly called pay-as-you-go in consumer mobile plans and sold as the cheapest option to customers that may not even speak the language the fine print is written in.

Having worked on the other side, both in startups I founded and later as a senior exec inside the large F100 valley tech company we were acquired by, this inability to communicate what &#x27;customers who want to buy&#x27; &#x27;want to know&#x27; constantly mystified me.<p>After deep diving into why it wasn&#x27;t working at BigCo, I think the root cause is systemic and it&#x27;s the bottom ~80% of sales and marketing people. In my experience, the top ~20% of sales and marketing people are generally excellent. But the rest seem to be &#x27;performing&#x27; their job functions generically without deeply thinking through how to most effectively communicate and sell &quot;this product&quot; to &quot;this customer&quot; in &quot;this context&quot;. That&#x27;s why so many product information pages follow templates which supposedly implement &#x27;best practices&#x27; but in reality are pretty terrible. And it&#x27;s probably why so many product pages lead with vague puffery. I had an anti-puffery rule for marketing copy: <i>only</i> lead with statements of fact about what makes this product different from the top three alternatives which can be proven true or false. &quot;Best in Class&quot;? Nope, anyone can claim that. Say something concrete that matters that we could get sued for lying about.<p>Typical entry level salespeople don&#x27;t really care that most introductory sales calls are a waste of everyone&#x27;s time. They are paid to do it anyway - and it&#x27;s one of the few pre-sales metrics that can be easily tracked, so lazy sales managers make increasing introductory sales calls an objective. That&#x27;s why anyone suggesting #nocalls, or even just offering it as an alternate sales funnel, faces so much resistance in an existing sales structure. Even proposing an objective A&#x2F;B test of #nocalls met was met with departmental &#x27;circle the wagons&#x27;. After talking it over one-on-one with different stakeholders, there was no clear reason they could articulate to oppose trying it. I suspect it was part &quot;this is the way we (and everyone like us) always does it&quot; and part fear that if it worked it would upset current metrics, budgets and even head count. Professional mid-level managers in large companies aren&#x27;t interested in upsetting their departmental apple cart (or turbo-charging it), they just want to add a few more apples to it each year.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42727614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42727614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">herpdyderp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42726381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42730021">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42728885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42727614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42727614">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ironically, I also actually can&#x27;t figure out what this company does from its website.</div><br/><div id="42727653" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42727653" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">diggan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42726381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42727614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42727924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42727653">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42727653">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The title on the website says &quot;licensing &amp; distribution&quot;, the paragraph under that repeats it and the code example shows some software trying to authorize a serial key to see if it&#x27;s valid or not.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how they could make it clearer?

It can also work in your favor as a buyer -- if you can, figure out when the company&#x27;s quarter end is, and line your purchase with that -- there&#x27;s a pretty good chance they&#x27;ll be incentivized to cut you a good deal if they&#x27;re trying to hit their numbers. Also, even if you&#x27;re not planning on buying from a competitor, get a quote from them, and say &quot;your competitor gave me X price, Im going to go with them unless you do better.&quot;</div><br/><div id="42731666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42731666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigstrat2003</span><span>|</span><a href="#42731108">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42726255">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42731666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42731666">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; From a customer perspective, if you&#x27;re making purchases of a certain size &quot;Call for Pricing&quot; is just a dance you need to learn to do.<p>No it isn&#x27;t.

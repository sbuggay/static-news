Mine is a bit more service &#x2F; cloud oriented in how it runs (shocker... at one point I made it into a product) while HPI is heavily local-first for obvious good reasons.<p>HPI is a great platform to build your own stuff off and benefit from all the work that has already been done because imo building a good foundation is the hardest part. Sean Breckenridge&#x27;s HPI-API is super interesting and useful, could likely be worked into this search engine concept, quite sure Sean actually has both newsboat and Firefox modules already made.<p>I wrote modules of my own and made an authentication wrapped HPI-API and a GraphQL instance but currently in the middle of an infra move so nothing super cool to show off. At one point I had a dashboard powered by it but we all know how these one-off internal-use-only projects end up. :)<p>I think the most interesting thing I&#x27;ve written for HPI is my ActivityWatch syncing. It&#x27;s been happily churning away for years and during my infra move, I discovered that it had about 20GB of activity data stockpiled. Multiple years of down to the second cataloguing of everything I did and saw on the computer.<p>Lots of interesting stuff in collecting and leveraging your data. If any of this stuff catches your eye, I highly encourage browsing karlicoss&#x27; exobrain [2] because there are some interesting things in there.<p>I post all of this to hopefully save someone (or many people) time because I recall how dejected I felt having spent multiple weekends chipping at a problem someone already solved better.

In the past I tried using YaCy in private mode, scraping a few aggregators and RSS feeds I read +2 levels of links. That was cool, but YaCy is practically dead these days and has various issues. Currently I&#x27;m trying ArchiveBox for the extraction + storage and poking around importing the results into Verba for RAG-style search using the local model of mixtral. ArchiveBox is nice in that it can do the text extractions from different types of media through a number of plugins. It&#x27;s early days, but I think that&#x27;s got a future.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38821219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38821219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theendisney2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38821213">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38822254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38821219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38821219">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If pages arent fast or links are broken i move the url to a different file checked less frequently, when checking those i move what fails to the next file and check that on an even lower frequency (if at all)<p>Yacy is also fun be it a tad weird.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

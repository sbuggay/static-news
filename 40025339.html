Don’t let the shock at the grocery store wear off – it’s real and painful despite what the news tells you.<p>True inflation would measure the amount of prosperity achieved per hour worked.<p>Take 1963 as an Example. Sears sold entire two story home kits with all materials for $1600. An Italian rifle in 1963 was $20. McDonalds burgers were 15¢ . Postage was 5¢ and had only increased 5 times in the previous 100 years.<p>You might retort that average household income is $70000 now vs $6200 in the early 60s– a tremendous boon. Remember in 1963 only the man was working, and typically supported 4 kids, a wife and often parents in the home.<p>In other words you had 1 man working 50 hours a week afford a house and support 5-6 other people.  Today you have 2 people working 100 hours a week to support 1-2 additional people , while living in an apartment and living in a run down and crime infested neighborhood.<p>In case you think this is academic, look at the occupations for those who lived in today’s wealthiest neighborhoods.  Today Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and other super zips are exclusively $500k incomes and up.  In the 1960 census records you will find these good neighborhoods occupied with plumbers, painters and other blue collar workers.<p>My point is that inflation isn’t abstract and it isn’t a law of nature. It’s a deliberate approach to stealing your prosperity while you cheer it on.<p>Summers is right more than he’s wrong.  Real inflation has always been higher than the bogus CPI numbers, and the past 5 years it’s been accelerating.</div><br/><div id="40025958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">woodruffw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025741">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40027968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025958">[49 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Remember in 1963 only the man was working, and typically supported 4 kids, a wife and often parents in the home.<p>This is a ridiculous exaggeration: the average US household was 3.7 people in the 1960s, not over 6[1].<p>There are good reasons to hold politicians to task for recent abnormally high inflation.

The CPI formula replaced the actual cost of financing homes and autos with a new term, owner&#x27;s equivalent rent. The argument made by the underlying paper [1] is that the older calculation better reflects the cost of living increases experienced by consumers and more closely correlates with the widely used University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment. Also, notable is that consumers care much more about the cumulative multi-year effect of inflation while economists only worry about year&#x2F;year changes in the rate of inflation as can be seen here [2] (worth a click)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;pir&#x2F;journal&#x2F;gj02.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;pir&#x2F;journal&#x2F;gj02.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;darioperkins&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770783161330323925&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;darioperkins&#x2F;status&#x2F;1770783161330323925&#x2F;...</a></div><br/><div id="40029227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40029227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">disgruntledphd2</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025741">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40028676">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40027694">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40029227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40029227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The really interesting thing about their proposed measure is that it reduces the period of extremely low interest rates post GFC.

I&#x27;ve seen the recent stat that food prices have increased a total of ~25% since before the pandemic -- but if you have a few  grocery items that you buy regularly that have doubled in price, you&#x27;re likely to be skeptical of this.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40025675" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40025675" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#40026176">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40026241">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40025675">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40025675">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Short version: if you include interest rates in the inflation metric, 2022 looked bad.</div><br/><div id="40026184" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40026184" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Phiwise_</span><span>|</span><a href="#40025675">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40025830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40026184">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40026184">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s more than just interest: 2022 just might have been the worst non-recession year in (modern, meaning years with acceptable stats) US economic history.

Salaries, income, capital gains, and property taxes add on top of that. Inflation happens when supply can’t keep up with demand or when supply is restricted to increase the costs on demand by retailers &#x2F; manufacturers &#x2F; suppliers of energy, etc.<p>Putin’s war on Ukraine triggered an energy shortage which jumped prices on everything worldwide. When that happens retailers have an excuse to raise prices and the excess cash in the system meant consumers didn’t really resist for a while (didn’t reduce spending, and won’t until credit tightened and people start filing for bankruptcy en masse). Instead of resisting higher prices with less consumption, the excess cash in the system is still so superfluous that it’s going back into crypto and stock market excess.<p>Now the expanding war in the middle east is going to raise energy prices even more and re-boost the inflation on everyday goods. The accumulating high interest consumer and commercial real estate debt is a ticking time-bomb and when that puts tension on the banks, the ever increasing liquidity ratios allowed by Trump will come back with a vengeance.<p>One way to fight back is to move massively to EVs and Solar - which is already happening. The decreases impact of oil prices and foreign conflicts on the economy would reduce inflation.<p>Another way is to increase supply of goods that are inflating. Lower tariffs or provide subsidies for new supply in each area with an increase in prices and see how incumbents would be incentivized to keep their prices at bay. Housing is kind of a big chunk of the wallet share. Increase supply - provide a massive incentive for families who built their first home or buy a new home. Provide incentive for empty homes or unused investment properties to be put back to use - many fear squatting or rent control laws, eliminate or reduce those and see how quickly the rentable supply increases, lowering costs of rent. Interest rates are a blunt tool. Increase supply and lower prices organically.<p>If interest rates and the costs of capital are added into the equation that determines interest rates by proxi of inflation, you’d get a recurrent function (an infinite loop). You want signal in the data, not noise. The problem is the current signal is employment, not supply.

Idk enough about the topic to really interpret this in a helpful way.<p><i>&quot;When people talk about inflation, they usually refer to ordinary goods and services, which is tracked by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This index excludes most financial assets and capital assets. Inflation of such assets should not be confused with inflation of consumer goods and services, as prices in the two categories are usually disconnected. The prices of some goods and services such as housing, energy, and food do track closely with some financial assets.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Asset_price_inflation#:~:text=Asset%20price%20inflation%20is%20the,government%20bonds%20or%20savings%20accounts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Asset_price_inflation#:~:tex...</a></div><br/><div id="40028115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40028115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">olliej</span><span>|</span><a href="#40026049">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40026478">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40028739">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40028115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40028115">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand how inflation is measured vs things like the CPI or &quot;basic costs for the overwhelming majority of entities and tax payers&quot;.<p>What I am saying is that it does not make sense that the measurement that influences policy, is the one that only meaningfully measures a subset of the economy that is the minority of the all people impacted by that policy, and as a result the policy decisions are made to benefit entities that represent a minority of participants in the economy, that already have a disproportionately large amount of capital, and for whom the real world impact of bad policy changes is negligible.<p>If a government wants to make policy choices that impact economic outcomes for everyone, the measurement used to control that policy should reflect the actual economic reality of the majority of entities impacted that policy, and the policy choices should be based on ensuring the best outcome for the majority of those impacted by the policy.<p>The current use of &quot;inflation&quot; as a driver for fiscal and monetary policy, is BS: the definition of inflation that is being used to drive policy is one that does not reflect real world costs for the overwhelming majority of entities impacted by the policy, and the targeted outcome is &quot;best outcome for a minority subset of the economy that are not subject to any the monetary or financial stressors or margins experienced by the majority&quot;.

Much older reason:
1) High inflation in 1960-1970s from stagflation
2) 1973 &quot;COLAs&quot; Law was passed, forcing increases in social security when inflation happens
3) By 1983, the US gov mathematically couldn&#x27;t give those increases. Inflation raged across 1970s.  So the government rigged CPI (inflation) numbers, by changing models
4) ShadowStats.com gives details and historic numbers
5) Lying about inflation numbers helped every politician from 1983 until now.
6) But citizens know the truth when they run out of money paying bills mid-month when they used to be able to pay for everything.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

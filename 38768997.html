That&#x27;s why open source works so well for commodity software. The challenge is that while everybody needs commodity software, they aren&#x27;t necessarily willing to pay for it. People pay for other things like managed services, support, etc. But not for software directly.<p>Take operating systems as an example. Unless you have very specific needs, Linux is probably good enough. That&#x27;s true across most of the industry. Most device manufacturers at this point default to using Linux. Why bother building your own OS when the commodity option does the job. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to want to compete with free and OSS. Apple and MS seem to continue to resist this notion but they are increasingly exceptions.<p>So, open source companies are a bit of a contradiction in terms. You invent something, and then immediately turn it into a cheap commodity by releasing it for free. And then you expect to get money for that. Investors get attracted by rapid growth. And giving something for free can produce some rapid growth.<p>So, they&#x27;ve repeated fallen into the trap of investing in what proved to be worthless commodities. Some outlasted their IPO at least, which makes for happy investors. But those quickly turn into niche products. Because they are at that point commodity software providers competing with perfectly good OSS ones.<p>Most new closed source database products out there only have a short while before their differentiating features are absorbed by open source ones. Twenty years ago there were lots of new database products. Most of those were OSS. Several of those then transitioned to closed source. But at this point postgresql does most of what used to make those products interesting. And if it doesn&#x27;t, just wait five years.<p>The finance model for OSS is very simple. You need OSS to produce closed source software. It&#x27;s not optional. You can&#x27;t compete by doing everything in house. So, most OSS software projects are financed by those companies using them the most. Those projects don&#x27;t fix themselves. So, there are a lot of companies spending money on the commodity stuff they&#x27;ve built their business on. For example, Oracle keeps on pooring money into Java. Even though it is open source. They make money from it elsewhere. Same with IBM. MS is a big OSS contributor. Google too. Every big software company out there. None of them are driven by idealistic motives. This is economically necessary for them to do.</div><br/><div id="38769933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jampekka</span><span>|</span><a href="#38769861">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769833">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769933">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The true tragedy is the economic system that makes this a tragedy.</div><br/><div id="38770053" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38770053" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chii</span><span>|</span><a href="#38769861">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769933">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769833">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38770053">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38770053">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">software has zero marginal cost, so therefore, if a piece of software can be used by the majority of humans, it makes sense that it ends up costing very little per instance of it.<p>It&#x27;s not a tragedy.

The point isn&#x27;t the firmware is free or non-free, hell, 3D printer firmware is rather easy to make. Prusa&#x27;s was already GPL&#x27;d and there&#x27;s no evidence that Bambu used it in their product, so making it non-free is pointless. The material issue is that Bambu is undercutting them on hardware costs. Now that Prusa is non-free, they have lost both the price, the hackability, and the moral advantage. It&#x27;s an utterly braindead move. If Prusa were smart they would be looking for ways to reduce production costs to get down to similar price points, investing in usability improvements, and <i>doubling down</i> on the free software approach. Let&#x27;s face it, Prusa got complacent and someone at their lunch.<p>You can monetize free software without breaking the social contract. I&#x27;m quite fine with your licensing approach with FSL, but it&#x27;s not free software nor open source, and it does not align with the social contract, and that&#x27;s all well and good so long as you can acknowledge that -- and live with the consequences, such as heavily disincentivizing third-party contributions. But you <i>can</i> make money with genuinely free software, social contract and everything, if you&#x27;re smarter about it than barking up the VC tree and promising infinite growth and monopolization using a tool (open source) which is not suited for that purpose by design -- <i>that</i> was Sentry&#x27;s mistake. Honestly, I&#x27;m glad that FSL is working out for you, but by no means does it justify some call to action to water down FOSS nor is it indicative of some fundamental problem with FOSS.</div><br/><div id="38769980" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769980" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sverhagen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38769930">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769980">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769980">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just wondering aloud, here, could it be that the open source company comes from a place of feigned or real enlightenment that makes it hard to compete on hardware cost, as the lowest-possible hardware cost may require unethical practices in sourcing or production?

This is not really a matter of FOSS or not, but it is something that Prusa absolutely needed to have foreseen and made a viable business plan to address. Chinese manufacturing was always a huge vulnerability in their business model and they definitely should have planned for that.<p>That could have taken many forms. They might have invested in a much stronger brand, aiming to make Prusa (needs a better name tbh) synonymous with 3D printing, and developing a product line which covers a wider range of needs, from entry-level highly-usable stuff up to hackable mid-tier things and possibly high-end workshop printers as well, all of which should have had a shared brand identity. China can&#x27;t really compete on reputation, so that&#x27;s where to focus. Moreover, they could have invested more in services surrounding the product, such as the aforementioned cloud printing services, perhaps a thingiverse-equivalent with a models marketplace and a small margin off of that, etc. Auto-detect when your filament is running low and have a subscription service to ship you a new one -- maybe the cloud printer notices when you don&#x27;t have enough in stock for a model you want and suggests you order more.<p>Just making a new model every 2 or 3 years and hoping China wouldn&#x27;t notice was a very stupid strategy, and the free or non-free nature of their firmware has nothing to do with that.<p>This is such a common failure mode in open source companies -- they think that the code is 90% of the battle for the market. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s more like 5% at best and <i>because it&#x27;s open source the rest of the market can make use of it</i>. This can be very powerful if you&#x27;re smart about it, but &quot;write the code and the rest will work out&quot; is not that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38769802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quickthrower2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38769930">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769802">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It might be 3D but it is funny open source and printers coming up when closed source printer drivers help kick off RMS and GPL.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38769617" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769617" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sinistersnare</span><span>|</span><a href="#38769802">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769617">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769617">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I always appreciate Armin&#x27;s posts.<p>I think the key point is that the FSL is necessary when profit is required.

I love this story about the development of the Atari 2600 game Pitfall.

It is, like, a pretty bad and un-fun game, doesn’t hold up as well as pong or pac-man at all. I think it was impressive at the time because it was at the limit of what the system could do.<p>It seems like a counter example to the thesis of the piece IMO. I get the idea that constraints can become part of the design and you get interesting ideas. But in this case, Pitfall! just does it’s best to mitigate the constraints and becomes a worse version of every successor that was made after the limitations were cleared.<p>&gt; We will only have settings that fit on one screen.<p>But, like, please don’t actually remove all the setting, that’s annoying.</div><br/><div id="40604746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40604746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jerf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40601692">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40605868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40604746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40604746">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Pitfall requires you to be willing to get a pencil and paper out to map it, and carefully track that underground, each screen change is three above-ground screen changes.

Watching it for the first time in a while a few years ago, the Gonk Torture scene[1] was where my switch flipped. That scene is just a callout to the looped animatronics in the line at Star Tours --- does bad looped robotic torture add anything, or did Lucas put it in because nobody would tell him no. I think ROTJ is also where Lucas started becoming dependent on chroma key (although he had used it before). Some of the chrome keyed scenes are groundbreaking effects wise, and that&#x27;s neat, but it takes away from immersion.<p>The prequel trilogy has so many scenes that feel sterile because the actors are clearly separated from the backdrop.

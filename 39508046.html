I was the same age as Chris Espinosa, who was Apple&#x27;s head of documentation at age 14. At that time it was still not perfectly clear that PCs would be regarded as essential to business. I had no one to talk to about computers and programming. I was in a very rough spot in my life and had to teach myself everything, while not being sure I&#x27;d have a job in 5 years.<p>A decade later in 1996 I started at Microsoft, which virtually all of my peers thought had run its course. They were selling stock like crazy. By the time I left 4 years later the stock had gone up 1300%. Last I checked it&#x27;s gone up yet another 2500% or so--I kept my 1,000 ESPP shares mostly out of nostalgia and thanks to a company that was so good to me.<p>I bought a website after the first dot com bust of 2001, monetized it by hiring well, and it provided a very good living for well over two decades after that.<p>This is an incredible time to start a web-based business because there&#x27;s a surfeit of free and almost free tools for development all the way to deployment.</div><br/><div id="39521421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39521421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kubb</span><span>|</span><a href="#39520392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39520614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39521421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39521421">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Damn, I better buy some tech stock if it’s gonna go up 13x in 4 years.<p>Actually if everyone just does that, nobody will need to work!</div><br/></div></div><div id="39520614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39520614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">up2isomorphism</span><span>|</span><a href="#39520392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39521421">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39520252">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39520614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39520614">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Give an example in 1985 to show there are opportunities today is not convincing.</div><br/><div id="39521430" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39521430" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grodriguez100</span><span>|</span><a href="#39520392">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39520614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39520892">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39521430">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39521430">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the point is that he thought it was too late in 1985, then people thought the same ten years later (1996), then the original article (from 2014) tries to explain how 2014 is not too late either (“the best time is now”).<p>In other words, it is always easy to think it is too late when looking back.

No one took the Mac seriously until Postscript and laser printers happened.<p>In October 1987 Black Monday hit, causing the worst market crash since the Depression.

There were startups, and a few of them became extremely successful, but it feels like most of them were either doomed to fail or be bought out by a larger company.

And there was the crypto stuff, yuck, many went to prison.<p>But the real revolution is AI. Thinking back to 2014 and peering forward, it’s unfathomable. If there had been a sci-fi movie, I would have thought it unrealistic. I still think I have no idea where this will take is or how much our industry will change.

Free online services we can connect to from anywhere has been an amazing change, a totally new expectation that totally changes how computing situates itself in our lives.<p>At much cost to figuring out further places to pioneer, I feel. We need new cycles with new energy, where lots of people are trying stuff out again. Computing &amp; tech should not stay well settled; we should be trying crazy stuff. It feels like a lifetime ago that Tim O&#x27;Reilly was preaching <i>&quot;follow the alpha geeks&quot;</i>, look for those very capable folks doing excellently for themselves. That ability to trendspot &amp; try lots of things has been somewhat by these huge scales &amp; systems, but I believe a return to personal-ity has to crop up again sometime. We&#x27;ll find some fertile terrains where new things are a happening again.<p>2014 was when thing were actually really setting in place, when the pioneering stage was really giving way to some settlers (and town planners, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gardeviance.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.gardeviance.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;on-pioneers-settlers-to...</a>). There&#x27;s a lot of roughness, but tech getting it&#x27;s mojo back may be not far off. It&#x27;s a challenge though; the reality of creating ever-connected ever-online systems is <i>hard</i>. We have amazing amounts of server we can fit in a pizza box, at incredibly low $&#x2F;performance, but we&#x27;re unpracticed at doing it without pain at smaller scales, by ourselves, anew. Trying to create new generative platforms, that serve as a basis to let more value spring up: it needs a strong foundation, so that it can keep &quot;creating more value than it captures,&quot; another O&#x27;Reilly-ism.<p>The future is (with hope) exciting!</div><br/></div></div><div id="39520368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39520368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">downWidOutaFite</span><span>|</span><a href="#39520586">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39519896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39520368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39520368">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This would be a lot more true if we could break up the trillion dollar tech monopolies.

Expectations and barriers were low. It was easy to be the first.</i><p>Personally the AI aspect feels like the least compelling aspect of how computing can build in-roads &amp; become genuinely compelling to the world again. Many many many people are on the sprinkle-on-some-AI-and-get-rich path, but it&#x27;s just incredibly non-contributive to the field, to expanding the frontier to me. Apply deep-learned expert-systems doesn&#x27;t making <i>computing</i> better on iota, doesn&#x27;t enhance man machine-symbiosis.<p>I crave a computing era where we can return to the fundamentals. To me, computing&#x27;s 90&#x27;s&#x2F;aughts boom was because we created a democratized access to all the tech, because OSS helped us all learn and grow together. We never had better leverage to <i>augment intellect</i> (the Douglas Engelbart vision&#x2F;mission) than that, and that made all the difference.

Directions like Mamba over hungry compute Transformers, SLM as over expensive LLMs, and so on, will commodify AI services as operational frameworks mature.

Go watch an Alan Kay talk, any of them; he&#x27;ll say what I&#x27;m saying: we barely have begun to figure out the actual essence of computing where it opens itself up to us &amp; makes us more potent people. We have been grinding on the same target, without pause for thinking about what general computing systems could be like, and it&#x27;s the wider view that this is all actually on service of, that will help us.<p>AI to me is mostly creating our own Dark Forest scenario on our own planet that we have to somehow coexist with.

I think a lot of the advice is applicable to startups.<p>1. KPIs, for Beast they are CTR, AVD, AVP, will look different if you are a startup. I am willing to bet he knows his metrics better than &gt;95% of startup founders. Because he is literally hacking&#x2F;being judged by an algorithm, his KPIs will matter more and can be closely dissected. Startups aren&#x27;t that easy in that sense, but KPIs still matter.<p>2. Hiring only A-players. Bloated teams kill startups.<p>3. Building value &gt; making money<p>4. Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders&#x2F;equity owners, not employees.<p>5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.<p>The management&#x2F;communication stuff is mostly about working on set&#x2F;dealing with physical scale. You need a lot more hands dealing with logistics, which requires hardline communication and management. In startups, the team is usually really lean and technical, so management becomes more straightforward.<p>I am also getting some bad culture vibes from the PDF and really dislike the writing style. I think it&#x27;s important not to micromanage to the extent he is--it&#x27;s necessary, maybe, for his business. Not for startups. Interesting perspective, reminds me of a chef de cuisine in a cutthroat 90s kitchen. The dishes (videos) have to be perfect, they require a lot of prep and a lot of hands, and you have to consistently pump them out.</div><br/><div id="41551031" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551031" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">latexr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550411">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551031">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551031">[75 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Lot of people critiquing this, but you can&#x27;t deny the success.<p>You could say that about literally any shady business.

Two fast food places can have the same quality of food, and the one with the drive through attendant that acknowledges people and responds to phatic phrases, and marks the diet soda cup is going to have more traffic and customer satisfaction than the one where the attendant barely acknowledges you&#x27;ve arrived at the window and leaves you to figure out which was the diet coke when you get home.</div><br/><div id="41551669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naming_the_user</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551669">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, it reads as being pretty standard to me.<p>To be honest I think there&#x27;s just a bit of a bifurcation between people who do business, like really do business as a competition like an Olympic sport, and people who just sort of like turn up and do their thing for a bit and then go home.<p>To the former camp all of this is intuitively obvious and doesn&#x27;t need spelling out although the insights are generally useful.</div><br/><div id="41551851" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551851" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grogenaut</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551669">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551851">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551851">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reading this post at the same time as a blind post where someone is asking what people do for the resto of the week once they finish their 2 hours of sprint work.<p>The dichotomy sometimes</div><br/><div id="41553380" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41553380" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">blindluck</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551851">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550679">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41553380">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41553380">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The blind poster is obviously more savvy than the &quot;A players&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41550679" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41550679" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nrp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550411">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551445">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550565">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41550679">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41550679">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That’s one of the most interesting parts of this document.

Yes, tons of people got free cataract surgery but that&#x27;s a band-aid solution to cataract surgery being artificially locked behind a paywall all those people were unable to bypass, and the paywall still exists and is still preventing multiple factors of that group from accessing the same surgery. And wells in the developing world has been a charity money sink for decades at this point, instead of asking &quot;well where&#x27;s the well you&#x27;re going to build&quot; why don&#x27;t you ask &quot;why do so many people all across the world lack clean water?&quot;<p>And the answer to that question is that it&#x27;s not profitable to provide clean drinking water to people who can&#x27;t pay for it. Not that it&#x27;s not possible, not that it&#x27;s not a solved engineering problem, clearly it is because some fuckin YouTuber pony&#x27;s up the cash and suddenly there&#x27;s a goddamn well. The only reason it&#x27;s not already there is because we decided someone has to pay for the problem to be solved, and if none of the people who need it solved can afford it, we let them continue drinking dirty water and die from preventable illness because they were born in the wrong income bracket.<p>And by the same logic, why does Mr. Beast have this money in the first place? Because he&#x27;s making bullshit videos about &quot;&quot;&quot;solving&quot;&quot;&quot; these problems, because presenting loud, stupid nonsense to a western audience, for free, so they can be showed video ads in the midst of it, is worth enough to pay for these fucking wells.<p>To make this completely fucking clear: the <i>attention</i> of a western, young audience who&#x27;s parents have money to spend and may, MIGHT, influence them to buy a product, is worth more than providing <i>clean fucking drinking water</i> to entire villages of people who live in a non-western place, with enough leftover for Mr. Beast to draw a frankly unethical salary for what he&#x27;s actually doing, and providing to the world. That level of inequity between two groups of people is the grand fucking canyon.<p>And, to make this other point extra clear, that&#x27;s not Mr. Beast&#x27;s fault. He&#x27;s acting completely rationally within a system that has utterly lost the plot in terms of what <i>actually has value.</i> The fact that unhinged amounts of money are going to a frankly, by all accounts I can find, quite amoral man who has cracked the code for generating loud, obnoxious nonsense that children will consume on an industrial scale so equally morally bankrupt companies can shove advertisements down their eyeballs and convince them to buy shit they don&#x27;t need, so much so that he can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make yet more loud, obnoxious bullshit, is the problem. All of this is so completely and thoroughly disentangled from any notion of what anyone actually needs, and the fact that tons of people on this board and elsewhere still manage to call this system the most rational economic system yet discovered while looking at this complete fucking nonsense is astonishing to me.</div><br/><div id="41551058" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551058" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vasco</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551044">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551058">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551058">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s great that you&#x27;ve figured out all the problems of the world, but I was simply answering &quot;what have they done&quot; to a mis-characterization that they are simply time-wasting machines.</div><br/><div id="41551187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ToucanLoucan</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551058">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551044">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551187">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They are time wasting machines.

He identified key KPIs and then experimented with changes until he found what worked. His whole north star to, minute by minute, structure each video, is informed by the KPIs. His whole strategy is built upon metrics by metrics.<p>He clearly is obsessed with them to a degree few are.

There are plenty of times when no most certainly means no, and you can really damage business and personal relationships if you can&#x27;t figure those out.</div><br/><div id="41552986" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552986" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pests</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551704">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552662">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552986">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552986">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing I find interesting over the last few weeks since this was released (and other MrBeast drama) is how there is now a separation between MrBeast the person and MrBeast the company.<p>Before today, it was never differentiated.

If you told me a factory runs their widget making machine at 70% capacity in case someone comes along with an order for a different widget or twice as many widgets, at first glance think that&#x27;s a bad idea. If your customers can keep your widget machine 100% full, using only part of the machine for the chance that something new will come along seems wasteful. And through cultural osmosis the idea of not letting your hardware sit idle is exactly the sort of thing that feels right.<p>And yet, we do this all the time in IT. If you instead of a widget machine told me that you run your web server at 100% capacity all the time, I&#x27;d tell you that&#x27;s also a terrible idea. If you&#x27;re running at 100% capacity and have no spare headroom, you can&#x27;t serve more users if one of them sends more requests than normal. Even though intuitively we know that a machine sitting idle is a &quot;waste&quot; of compute power, we also know that we need capacity in reserve because demand isn&#x27;t constant. No one sizes (or should size) their servers for 100% utilization. Even when you have something like a container cluster, you don&#x27;t target your containers to 100% utilization, if for no other reason than you need headroom while the extra containers spin up.

The thing that can be sacrificed in order to obtain efficiency is resilience.<p>To master the bend not break model.<p>You can make a bridge that can handle a 10 ton load for half the material of one that can take 20 tons. 99% of the time this isn&#x27;t an issue but that outlier case of a 18 ton truck can be disastrous. This is why power cables have sag in them, in case there is an extreme cold snap. Why trees sway and bend with the wind so that anything but the most extreme evens do not break them; with that analogy, grass is much weaker but could handle even higher winds. The ridged are brittle.<p>I&#x27;m not saying to not strive for efficiency but you also have to allow those efficiency gains to provide some slack in the system. Where I work, there is a definite busy season. So for most of the year, we operate at about 70% utilization and it works out great. Most people are not stressed at all. It means that when those 2 months of the year when it is all hands on deck, everyone is in peak condition to face it head on.<p>In my previous job in manufacturing, efficiency was praised over everything else, it was 100% utilization all of the time. So when the COVID rush came, it practically broke the business. After a year of those unrelenting pace, we started to bleed out talent. Over the next 6 months, they lost all the highest talent. A year later from those I still spoke with, they said they lost about two thirds of their business over the next 12 months, they are now on the edge of collapse.<p>Slack allows a bend, pure efficiency can lead to a break.

For instance when Apple pays TSMC all the money in the world to produce the next iPhone chip, they won&#x27;t be running that line at 70%, the full capacity is reserved.<p>Or if you&#x27;re a bakery, you won&#x27;t keep two or three cake cooking spots just on case someone comes in witb an extraordinary order, you won&#x27;t make enough on that to cover the lost opportunity.<p>We run our servers at 70% or even 50% capacity because we don&#x27;t have control on what that capacity will be used for, as external events happen all the time. A manufacturers receiving a spike of extra orders can just refuse them and go on with their day. Our servers getting hit with 10x the demand requires efforts and measures to protect the servers and current traffic.<p>Factories want to optimize for efficiency, server farms want to pay for more reactivity, that&#x27;s the nature of the business.</div><br/><div id="41552178" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552178" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tpmoney</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550353">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552178">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552178">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Or if you&#x27;re a bakery, you won&#x27;t keep two or three cake cooking spots just on case someone comes in witb an extraordinary order, you won&#x27;t make enough on that to cover the lost opportunity.<p>I think it&#x27;s always worth thinking about what you can leave slack &#x2F; idle space in. For example, you might not keep multiple stations free, but you might invest in a larger oven than you need to make the cakes you currently make. Or you might invest in more bakery space than you need, including extra workspace than you can utilize at 100%. Not because you necessarily anticipate higher demand, but because you might get a customer that&#x27;s asking for a cake bigger than your standard. Or because you might have a customer placing a large order and need some extra room to spread out more, or to have a temporary helper be able to do some small part of the job even if they can&#x27;t use the space as a full station.<p>But also idleness might look like &quot;you don&#x27;t spend all of your time baking orders for customers&quot;.

Having a loop where you keep publishing content and analyzing all aspects of it is the ultimate key to success, given enough time and resources.<p>As I understand it, MrBeast helped fund the creation of ViewStats [0] in order to gather more data on thumbnails and channel &#x2F; video performance over time. Then this knowledge is applied to their own content in order to make it even more successful. At this point there&#x27;s probably multiple people who specialize just in thumbnail optimization.<p>Another key detail about MrBeast production is that they target a global audience, so they hire famous voice actors of every major language to do their voice-overs. A few years before YouTube supported multiple audio tracks, they had different channels for various languages and regions. Now it&#x27;s just a drop-down in the video settings. Many products fail to take internationalization and localization seriously, so their products are unable to penetrate non-western markets.<p>Speaking of international reach, I saw in an interview a few years back that MrBeast was trying to expand to the Chinese market, but none of his public interviews since then have discussed how he&#x27;s doing there. This goes a bit against the extreme focus on YouTube as his primary platform. A quick search on bilibili (which I believe is the Chinese equivalent of YouTube), shows his latest video hitting 1.6 million views and 8k comments, which isn&#x27;t bad but it doesn&#x27;t really compare to the amount of attention that he gets on YouTube. It seems like even the most skilled content creators in the West still struggle to break into the Chinese market.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewstats.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewstats.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41550025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41550025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jack_riminton</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550911">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41549952">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41550025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41550025">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was fully expecting to read a load of nonsense, but it chimes quite a lot with military training, which shouldn&#x27;t actually be that surprising.<p>e.g. if someone is your bottleneck make them aware, give them a due date, check in regularly, in person comms is better than written etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41549952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41549952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">al_borland</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550025">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554036">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41549952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41549952">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; “I Spent 50 Hours In Ketchup”<p>Mr Beast throwing out viral video ideas sounds like the Family Guy joke generator from South Park[0].<p>Doing a quick web search, it seems several people have made idea generators based off his formula.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qTC9j0QpCBM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qTC9j0QpCBM</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41554036" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41554036" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">veunes</span><span>|</span><a href="#41549952">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41554036">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41554036">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MrBeast has a deep understanding of his audience.

He knows youtube very well, but it&#x27;s clear from his other business ventures that he&#x27;s not good in other markets. I don&#x27;t think you can translate ALL the stuff there into other markets.<p>b) There&#x27;s a lot of unhealthy stuff mixed in with the parts that seem like they drive his success. If somebody does X, Y and Z and gets insane levels of success, they may not realize that it&#x27;s X and Y driving the success, and Z is actively harmful. But I guess it depends on what you consider &quot;harmful&quot; - some might think &quot;harmful&quot; means &quot;hurts the bottom line&quot; and some might think &quot;hurts those lowest on the rung&quot;. Either one of those might be true. It&#x27;s like people who think being an asshole like early Steve Jobs is the way to be a successful leader, when he arguably achieved more lasting impact when he mellowed out.<p>With that context, I think some of the critiques you mention have substance.<p>&quot;He&#x27;s making low value content&quot; -&gt; I think this is true, because he&#x27;s optimized for the market he&#x27;s in. I think it&#x27;s a legit critique that this strategies may not be sustainable or applicable to &quot;high value content&quot;. He even expressly says this: &quot;Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible.&quot;<p>&quot;the culture of the company is horrible&quot; -&gt; I absolutely think this is worth talking about, and I find it hard to see building a long term company on his approach. The myth that you need to push people to breaking points to be successful is poison.<p>&quot;he&#x27;s a fraud&#x2F;it&#x27;s more luck than skill&quot; -&gt; Well anyone saying that is just wrong. He obviously is very good at what he does.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good long term business strategy to depend so much on a single larger company, one who has a history of changing the algorithm without warning or explanation. But it&#x27;s a good, but painful, short term strategy, and he will come out of it perfectly fine whenever he suddenly becomes irrelevant. But there are others who won&#x27;t&#x2F;haven&#x27;t come out with much, and I think it&#x27;s good to have a discussion if this is right or not.<p>But there are good things there, the critical components, the importance of communication. The direct feedback of &quot;You are my bottleneck&quot; is good, but it easily could turn into passive aggression and ways to pass the buck. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty of low quality comments here, but don&#x27;t just write off all criticism as virtue signalling or whatever. There are def lessons in here, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s all above questioning.</div><br/><div id="41552598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ta_1138</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551180">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552598">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s true that having to push people to the breaking point is poison.

I don&#x27;t get &quot;sponge bob square pants&quot; but there are people out that that insist it was if not a pinnacle of animation entertainment, then a hugely creative and entertaining show that deserves its place in the pantheons of animation. And all those huge 80&#x27;s era properties that so many have years of nostalgic memories of, like transformers, he-man or voltron were all &quot;cynical cash grabs&quot; and 30 minute commercials for toys. So much so the concerned parents of the time demanded the government step in. Now the jury might be out on whether that generation is worse than previous generations, but if they are I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be because transformers was a toy marketing gimmick instead of high art with a strong moral message.<p>Kids I know find all sorts of things ridiculously amusing and entertaining and it all seems stupid, brainless and mind rotting to me. But then again, the stuff I found ridiculously amusing and entertaining at that age was (I can attest, having gone back and watched some of it) was just as stupid, brainless and mind rotting. Some of it is not having a &quot;sufficiently developed palette&quot; for humor and entertainment. Some of it is because that humor and entertainment was genuinely new to me at the time, where as now I&#x27;ve seen it before so when it shows up in the kids stuff, it&#x27;s not entertaining anymore. It&#x27;s sort of the reverse of the &quot;Seinfeld isn&#x27;t funny&quot; issue. We&#x27;re not looking at something in the past and wondering why it was so great because it&#x27;s been out shadowed by what it inspired.

My Dad in particular would get annoyed at what he saw as &quot;needlessly flicking between channels&quot;.<p>I can remember visiting friends houses where there would be multiple television sets (including tv sets in bedrooms) and television would always be turned on, even if no one was watching it.

How does one go about finding genuinely good consultants, in any industry?<p><pre><code>  &gt; &quot;Use Consultants

  Consultants are literally cheat codes. Need to make the world&#x27;s largest slice of cake? Start off by calling the person who made the previous world&#x27;s largest slice of cake lol. He&#x27;s already done countless tests and can save you weeks worth of work. I really want to drill this point home because I&#x27;m a massive believer in consultants. Because I&#x27;ve spent almost a decade of my life hyper obsessing over YouTube, I can show a brand new creator how to go from 100 subscribers to 10,000 in a month. On their own it would take them years to do it. Consults are a gift from god, please take advantage of them. In every single freakin task assigned to you, always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you. This is so important that I am demanding you repeat this three times in your head &quot;I will always check for consultants when I&#x27;m assigned a task&quot;&quot;</code></pre></div><br/><div id="41553322" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41553322" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solatic</span><span>|</span><a href="#41552069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41553322">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41553322">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s really a question of your expectations.<p>If you&#x27;re a software shop, hiring an army of consultants to build out core parts of your solution who will walk away when they&#x27;re finished, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Success doesn&#x27;t come from assembling piles of slop, it comes from putting together a team that will stick together to build value over the long term.<p>If you&#x27;re an individual who wants to improve X part of themselves (fitness, musical ability, scholarship, whatever) then hiring a &quot;consultant&quot; (a trainer, a coach, a tutor, a therapist) is not only massively beneficial but almost an essential part of the process. You can easily measure the value you&#x27;re getting from the consultant against the progress you&#x27;re making.<p>If you&#x27;re assembling highly complicated custom work on strict deadlines, hiring experts in that specific area of customization is pretty critical to consistently making those deadlines.<p>&gt; How do you find them?<p>Connections, networking, and reputation, usually. MrBeast is lucky in that YouTube presents a good search platform; trying to find people who had made massive cakes before was probably just 5 minutes of searching and sorting by views.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41552512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atomicUpdate</span><span>|</span><a href="#41552069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41553322">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552512">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Both of the examples in the quote give you the answer: talk to someone that’s actually done it.<p>It’s always amazing to me how often the person 3 desks over has already solved the same problem, but is never asked how by the next person.

In markets where you have mostly responsible actors, that can work out fine. But absent effective regulation or other feedback mechanisms, in many markets an actor who only cares about short-term cash extraction can beat out the people focused on long-term value by taking advantage of consumer ignorance.<p>A good example here is food. Before the rise of industrial meat production, you would process meat yourself or buy it from a local butcher. You had a lot of information about the meat because the processing chain was short and local. You knew the people touching your food and could smell how clean they kept the butcher shop.<p>But scaling that up created a lot of opacity. Suddenly it was much harder to know what went into your sausage. It was tens, hundreds, thousands of people involved, spread over many miles. Some dubious people took advantage, and so we ended up with food standards like the Federal Meat Inspection Act. [1] The system that grew out of that works pretty well; things Boar&#x27;s Head recently killing 9 people [2] are surprisingly rare.<p>For things less risky than safety, I think a lot of good is done by people like Consumer Reports and Wirecutter. Less ignorance about which products are really good is less room for bad actors to exploit consumers. If people really didn&#x27;t want nice things, those would be much less popular. Instead, I think they&#x27;re a sign that people do want nice things, but just have an awful lot to do, and so can&#x27;t spend much time on a single purchasing decision unless it&#x27;s a really big deal for them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federal_Meat_Inspection_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federal_Meat_Inspection_Act</a>, with a nod to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Jungle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Jungle</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2024_United_States_listeriosis_outbreak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2024_United_States_listeriosis...</a></div><br/><div id="41557818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41557818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DwnVoteHoneyPot</span><span>|</span><a href="#41555216">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41555800">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41557282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41557818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41557818">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We do generally want nice things, but we can&#x27;t be experts in all the things.<p>Counter-point: People complain a lot about leg-room on airplanes.

If I search for flights, the price is much more visible than a leg room measure. Two, people can certainly be fooled; for a long time airlines have been playing a game of gradually ratcheting back amenities without being up front about it. This is the same game that consumer packaged goods companies play with apparent package size. Three, people pay for more leg room all the time. Last I booked a flight, about half the plane was first class, business class, economy plus, or exit rows. Personally, I sometimes pay for it and sometimes don&#x27;t. When I don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s sometimes because I resent how grossly extractive airlines have gotten.<p>I also think &quot;empirically want&quot;, however cute it is as a linguistic trick, is not particularly accurate. Is it what gets him paid? I&#x27;d believe it. Is it what they watch? Sometimes, for some people! But pretending that short-term behavior is equivalent to what somebody really wants is choosing to ignore a great deal.

They did not recover the costs and walked it back. jetBlue provides more legroom through all of coach, and even I as a very tall person, don&#x27;t go out of my way to book them.<p><i>Some</i> people will pay more for extra legroom, and I think the current split of seating in planes is likely right around the optimal distribution based on who will and won&#x27;t pay.<p>&gt; Two, people can certainly be fooled; for a long time airlines have been playing a game of gradually ratcheting back amenities without being up front about it.<p>Kind of but not really. Yeah they&#x27;re not going to put out a press release when they take the olives off your salad. Airlines are an incredibly low margin commodity business. Many years they&#x27;re negative margins. American&#x27;s current operating margin is 3.41% [1] This is typical. These aren&#x27;t B2B SaaS margins we&#x27;re talking about.<p>So generally when they take the olives off your salad, instead of putting out a press release they just lower fares on competitive routes. Because most people book on fare or based on corporate contract, which is a second-order effect of fare.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AAL&#x2F;american-airlines-group&#x2F;operating-margin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AAL&#x2F;american-airli...</a></div><br/><div id="41559336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41559336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OrigamiPastrami</span><span>|</span><a href="#41555216">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41558537">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563484">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41559336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41559336">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; jetBlue provides more legroom through all of coach, and even I as a very tall person, don&#x27;t go out of my way to book them.<p>How tall are you?

By that logic, you&#x27;re not qualified to defend Mr. Beast either because you don&#x27;t actually understand the causal relationship between success and charity. It&#x27;s nonsense criticism, a thought-terminating argument intended to obviate good-faith discussion.<p>Mr. Beast&#x27;s problem is obvious, <i>if</i> you&#x27;re willing to look past his marketing. Because at the end of the day, he&#x27;s a business. He uses the same playbook as the most abusive monopolies like Apple and Google, laundering his reputation as a healthy net positive on society. Scratching beneath the surface, people know that he lied about how much money he makes, he lied about the cars he drives and the house he lives in, and probably lies to his employees to prevent them from presenting serious competition. Assuming Mr. Beast is, well, smart, assigning him as a happy-go-lucky charity cause is exactly the sort of outcome he wants. If he was serious about charity or altruism, he&#x27;d have some grander plan than sponsoring game shows and leeching off his popularity for profit.<p>By sincerely believing the image he presents, you yourself have been manipulated into thinking he&#x27;s inert.

Rewarding employees who make value for the business and think like founders&#x2F;equity owners, not employees.<p>5. Understanding that some videos only his team can do, and actively exploiting and widening that gap.<p>The management&#x2F;communication stuff is mostly about working on set&#x2F;dealing with physical scale.

A lot of marketing deliberately exploits this, e.g. the common tactic of &quot;giving something for free&quot; to make the consumer feel like they owe a favor, or giving products a cutesy persona so consumers anthropomorphize the product and their interactions with it instead of seeing it as a disposable tool.<p>We come into this world naked, defenseless, starving and freezing. Other animals are able to defend themselves or at least flee, often only minutes after being born or hatching. It takes literal months for us to learn to meaningfully move on our own, about a year to feed ourselves and many more years to be able to pose a meaningful threat to natural predators or forage for food on our own. Throughout this entire time we not only need to be nurtured by our parents, we need an entire society to sustain us and our caregivers.<p>This is a common misunderstanding of our evolution: it&#x27;s not simply our brains that gave us an edge over the rest of the animal kingdom, it&#x27;s our cooperation. Large brains are a natural consequence of complex social interactions and feed back into them. It&#x27;s not just the ability to make and use tools that set us apart, it&#x27;s our ability to teach each other about them and learn from each other.<p>It didn&#x27;t take a great individual inventor, it took a tribe full of people to carry on each invention and pass the knowledge to the next generation while sustaining the tribe to allow the inventors to invent new technology or improve upon old ones for the benefit of the entire tribe.

Why? Because Chick Fil A really tries to not have &quot;C&quot; employees (relative to fast food employees in general), and it shows in the customer experience. Two fast food places can have the same quality of food, and the one with the drive through attendant that acknowledges people and responds to phatic phrases, and marks the diet soda cup is going to have more traffic and customer satisfaction than the one where the attendant barely acknowledges you&#x27;ve arrived at the window and leaves you to figure out which was the diet coke when you get home.</div><br/><div id="41554210" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41554210" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bnralt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551445">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551669">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41554210">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41554210">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s the same impression I got.

Effectively “pick a person in the other group to be your liaison and your counterpart and coordinate directly, don’t just throw stuff over the wall and hope someone picks it up”. It’s the same basic psychological concept as “in an emergency situation pick one person in the crowd, point them out and tell them personally to go call 911”. Diffusion of responsibility means people will delay or stuff will get dropped. To make things happen you have to make sure things are assigned. Surely this isn’t particularly surprising or controversial right? It’s why large teams often appoint “interrupt” workers who are appointed to specifically answer out of band requests coming in. It’s why you have an on call rotation instead of just paging the entire company if something goes down. It’s why agile appoints a “scrum master” whose singular mission is to clear up blocking issues for the team. It’s why if you don’t assign people to work on maintenance, maintenance won’t get done.<p>I read that part of the document as saying “if you’re in charge of producing a video due in 45 days, don’t just send a general request for someone to make a script to the writing department, pick a person and get on the same page about what needs to be done and when”</div><br/></div></div><div id="41555268" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41555268" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bnralt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550368">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41555089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41557432">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41555268">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41555268">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Like, the part about making your co-workers feel like they&#x27;re bottlenecking you; can&#x27;t imagine working in an environment where everyone tries that number on everyone else.

The goal is to explain to the coworker that what they need to do for the project is important to the point where any delays is going to cause a delay for the entire project. This isn&#x27;t intended to be a negative statement; many projects do rely heavily on certain members getting things in by a particular timeline, and if that isn&#x27;t communicated and followed up on, projects will fail. The dudebro speech in the document lacks tact, but the underlying principal is sound. The excerpt:<p>&gt; DO NOT just go to them and say “I need creative, let me know when it’s done” and “I need a thumbnail, let me know when it’s done”. This is what most people do and it’s one of the reasons why we fail so much. I want you to look them in the eyes and tell them they are the bottleneck and take it a step further and explain why they are the bottleneck so you both are on the same page. “Tyler, you are my bottleneck. I have 45 days to make this video happen and I can not begin to work on it until I know what the contents of the video is. I need you to confirm you understand this is important and we need to set a date on when the creative will be done.” Now this person who also has tons of shit going on is aware of how important this discussion is and you guys can prio it accordingly. Now let’s say Tyler and you agree it will be done in 5 days. YOU DON’T GET TO SET A REMINDER FOR 5 DAYS AND NOT TALK TO HIM FOR 5 DAYS! Every single day you must check in on Tyler and make sure he is still on track to hit the target date. I want less excuses in this company. Take ownership and don’t give your project a chance to fail. Dumping your bottleneck on someone and then just walking away until it’s done is lazy and it gives room for error and I want you to have a mindset that God himself couldn’t stop you from making this video on time. Check. In. Daily. Leave. No. Room. For.

In some cases, the cost of tobacco straight up exceeds the profit. Meaning, from a communal economic standpoint, they are a net-negative. Yes, it&#x27;s true, tobacco, while wildly popular, is economically in the red.<p>Of course, we live in a staunchly capitalistic, individualistic society.

As though startups are trying to hire mediocre people instead of having no choice.<p>If a startup can&#x27;t attract talent (a sign of bad traction), that startup probably is not that good and more people won&#x27;t solve the underlying problem. You would also be surprised how many startups outsource dev&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;etc. in their initial stages.<p>If you can&#x27;t convince smart people to work for you and that your idea is good, good luck trying to convince customers of the same.<p>&gt;And that 95% of startups don&#x27;t know their metrics. Pretty sure almost all do but again don&#x27;t have the skills or resources to meaningfully move them.<p>I said most don&#x27;t know them as well as Mr. Beast. Read &quot;Chapter 1: What makes a Youtube video viral?&quot;. Most founders have not put the same amount of time into seeing how to track, measure, and impact metrics. He identified key KPIs and then experimented with changes until he found what worked. His whole north star to, minute by minute, structure each video, is informed by the KPIs. His whole strategy is built upon metrics by metrics.<p>He clearly is obsessed with them to a degree few are.

I would like to tell you a bit of a personal story and this may shed some light on your question. Disclaimer* I am American.<p>I was working at Tesla on the CapEx team, and unless you were doing something &quot;interesting&quot;, like going to Tahoe or something, then you were expected to be in the office on Saturday and Sunday.<p>I worked my ass off, pulling 70 hour weeks, catching naps in a conference room when there was a big push. I learned to be energized by my work, seeing the factory cells come together gave me this giant rush. Eventually, I got the thought you had but i worded it differently. &quot;I will never be Elon, working for Elon&quot;.<p>So when Covid hit, i got put fully remote and started having some conversations with potential clients to launch my own consultancy. After a couple of months, our managers told us to start coming back into office. I had gotten some traction with the consultancy, so i decideded to &quot;do [myself] a favour and do it as a leader where [i] call[ed] the shots and have the equity instead of as a follower.&quot;<p>At first it was great! I was learning an absolute ton, designed my own website from scratch, wrote a bunch of automation code, my sales ration was like 85% because i was just calling on all my old associates and references of references... life was great!<p>Then after i scaled,  I realized I wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything... I have these meetings, and my schedule is always swamped with evaluating this peice of software&#x2F;this person, generating &quot;Work&quot; for different people, and i freaking hated it! I stopped learning... I had no peers, only employees. I had &quot;Mentors&quot; but my consultancy was so nitch so outside &quot;Executive mentorship&quot; i had no one to guide me. I tried to focus on growth opportunities within the company, scaling different verticles as different companies and other things to keep my mind working, but i slowly but surely lost interest. I couldn&#x27;t push myself 70 hours a week because i didn&#x27;t have anyone pushing me, and i hated &quot;Consulting&quot;.<p>but every chance i got i would be watching drone videos over the Giga Texas progress. I kept up with every SpaceX, Tesla update ever...<p>And suddenly i realised,
i deeply missed working at Tesla...
i don&#x27;t want to be Elon...<p>But that Elon is building some pretty cool shit, and factories, robots, automation is super cool and fun.<p>So i sold my consultancy for 1.5X revenues (Pretty shit deal but i wanted out). It didn&#x27;t give me fuck you money but i could have chilled for a bit...<p>but now I&#x27;m happily working my ass off back at Tesla, fulfilling Elons dream. But i get to &quot;Give up my life&quot; to get to play with robots all day. I&#x27;m learning a ton again, i love my team, and i&#x27;ve never met a smarter group of people.</div><br/><div id="41557070" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41557070" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jrochkind1</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551704">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41555679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41563095">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41557070">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41557070">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very interesting personal experience, thanks!<p>I agree that doing meaningless work is soul crushing even if well-compensated.<p>It seems like it ought to be possible to do meaningful work without working 80 hour weeks, but maybe not!<p>And owning your own business isn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> an easy 40 hours a week and don&#x27;t think about it when you&#x27;re not working, but sounds like you did have a lighter schedule?

But &quot;we live in a society&quot;, even you are subject to wider trends of how people around you live their lives and spend their time. And average people&#x27;s front page is filled with slop and AI generated chum and Youtube-face thumbnails etc. While you can configure ublock origin to remove irrelevant recommendations from the middle of search results, the average person browses the internet without adblock and sinks hours into mindlessly scrolling social media.<p>Our parents worried about us staring at the TV all day, and today we have that on super steroids.<p>It&#x27;s super hard to avoid rabbit holes. Once the recommender engine picks up on something you find interesting it will exploit that with no end.<p>The mind numbing stuff can be highly specific that no human TV program manager would ever think up. For example, I clicked a few videos about cow and horse hoof trimming and horseshoe applications. Kinda interesting, geeking out on skilled crafts like this, never seen it done in real life, maybe I learn something interesting! And a few days later I find myself regularly clicking these because I get so many of these now on my frontpage and I kind of take a step back and think, is this really time well spent? Watching hoof after hoof being trimmed? (By the way, these videos have millions of views each, and have entire channels dedicated to producing them over and over again. It&#x27;s an entire <i>genre</i>, not just a few videos.)<p>I see this stuff with family members too. Zoning out and watching repetitive crap, like the hydraulic press channel, red hot ball, a guy who cleans up backyards, powerwashing objects, dashcam crashes, arrest bodycam footage, pimple popping, mukbang. (And I&#x27;m not even getting into political outrage stuff, that&#x27;s a topic to itself.) Once Youtube figures out which type of repetitive brain-numbing genre you respond to, it will push it.

If you told me a factory runs their widget making machine at 70% capacity in case someone comes along with an order for a different widget or twice as many widgets, at first glance think that&#x27;s a bad idea. If your customers can keep your widget machine 100% full, using only part of the machine for the chance that something new will come along seems wasteful. And through cultural osmosis the idea of not letting your hardware sit idle is exactly the sort of thing that feels right.<p>And yet, we do this all the time in IT. If you instead of a widget machine told me that you run your web server at 100% capacity all the time, I&#x27;d tell you that&#x27;s also a terrible idea. If you&#x27;re running at 100% capacity and have no spare headroom, you can&#x27;t serve more users if one of them sends more requests than normal. Even though intuitively we know that a machine sitting idle is a &quot;waste&quot; of compute power, we also know that we need capacity in reserve because demand isn&#x27;t constant. No one sizes (or should size) their servers for 100% utilization. Even when you have something like a container cluster, you don&#x27;t target your containers to 100% utilization, if for no other reason than you need headroom while the extra containers spin up. Odd that without thinking that through, I wouldn&#x27;t have applied the same idea to manufacturing machinery.</div><br/><div id="41551719" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41551719" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DaoVeles</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41551719">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41551719">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a very key insight many need to be aware of. The thing that can be sacrificed in order to obtain efficiency is resilience.<p>To master the bend not break model.<p>You can make a bridge that can handle a 10 ton load for half the material of one that can take 20 tons. 99% of the time this isn&#x27;t an issue but that outlier case of a 18 ton truck can be disastrous. This is why power cables have sag in them, in case there is an extreme cold snap. Why trees sway and bend with the wind so that anything but the most extreme evens do not break them; with that analogy, grass is much weaker but could handle even higher winds. The ridged are brittle.<p>I&#x27;m not saying to not strive for efficiency but you also have to allow those efficiency gains to provide some slack in the system. Where I work, there is a definite busy season. So for most of the year, we operate at about 70% utilization and it works out great. Most people are not stressed at all. It means that when those 2 months of the year when it is all hands on deck, everyone is in peak condition to face it head on.<p>In my previous job in manufacturing, efficiency was praised over everything else, it was 100% utilization all of the time. So when the COVID rush came, it practically broke the business. After a year of those unrelenting pace, we started to bleed out talent. Over the next 6 months, they lost all the highest talent. A year later from those I still spoke with, they said they lost about two thirds of their business over the next 12 months, they are now on the edge of collapse.<p>Slack allows a bend, pure efficiency can lead to a break.

If you don&#x27;t expect any, you run at 100%. For instance when Apple pays TSMC all the money in the world to produce the next iPhone chip, they won&#x27;t be running that line at 70%, the full capacity is reserved.<p>Or if you&#x27;re a bakery, you won&#x27;t keep two or three cake cooking spots just on case someone comes in witb an extraordinary order, you won&#x27;t make enough on that to cover the lost opportunity.<p>We run our servers at 70% or even 50% capacity because we don&#x27;t have control on what that capacity will be used for, as external events happen all the time. A manufacturers receiving a spike of extra orders can just refuse them and go on with their day. Our servers getting hit with 10x the demand requires efforts and measures to protect the servers and current traffic.<p>Factories want to optimize for efficiency, server farms want to pay for more reactivity, that&#x27;s the nature of the business.</div><br/><div id="41554792" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41554792" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kookybakker</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552178">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41554792">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41554792">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think even for a company like TSMC these ideas are important to understand.<p>To give you an example TSMC might have a factory with 10 expensive EUV lithography tools, each capable of processing 100 wafers per hour.

But compared to the cost of the EUV tools, the ovens are very cheap.

For example, you might not keep multiple stations free, but you might invest in a larger oven than you need to make the cakes you currently make. Or you might invest in more bakery space than you need, including extra workspace than you can utilize at 100%. Not because you necessarily anticipate higher demand, but because you might get a customer that&#x27;s asking for a cake bigger than your standard.

Having a loop where you keep publishing content and analyzing all aspects of it is the ultimate key to success, given enough time and resources.<p>As I understand it, MrBeast helped fund the creation of ViewStats [0] in order to gather more data on thumbnails and channel &#x2F; video performance over time. Then this knowledge is applied to their own content in order to make it even more successful. At this point there&#x27;s probably multiple people who specialize just in thumbnail optimization.<p>Another key detail about MrBeast production is that they target a global audience, so they hire famous voice actors of every major language to do their voice-overs. A few years before YouTube supported multiple audio tracks, they had different channels for various languages and regions. Now it&#x27;s just a drop-down in the video settings. Many products fail to take internationalization and localization seriously, so their products are unable to penetrate non-western markets.<p>Speaking of international reach, I saw in an interview a few years back that MrBeast was trying to expand to the Chinese market, but none of his public interviews since then have discussed how he&#x27;s doing there. This goes a bit against the extreme focus on YouTube as his primary platform. A quick search on bilibili (which I believe is the Chinese equivalent of YouTube), shows his latest video hitting 1.6 million views and 8k comments, which isn&#x27;t bad but it doesn&#x27;t really compare to the amount of attention that he gets on YouTube. It seems like even the most skilled content creators in the West still struggle to break into the Chinese market.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewstats.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewstats.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41558807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41558807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trogdor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550911">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41557100">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41558807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41558807">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn’t know that YouTube supports multiple audio tracks for the same video.

The content is neither necessary nor sufficient to make an informed purchase decision.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41556850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41556850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aae42</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551892">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41557512">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41555674">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41556850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41556850">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not so sure, while I like Marques, he has a 100% focus on consumerism.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41555674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41555674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThrowawayTestr</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551892">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41556850">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561735">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41555674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41555674">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Watching a review on a device you&#x27;ll never buy is hardly a net positive compared to watching a yacht get blown up.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41561735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41561735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HDThoreaun</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551892">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41555674">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41557211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41561735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41561735">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MKBHD feeds the worst aspects of consumer culture.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41557211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41557211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">snapcaster</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551892">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41561735">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41553640">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41557211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41557211">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Come on, they&#x27;re both useless consumerist slop (i watch a lot of slop not throwing stones just don&#x27;t see either as beneficial at all)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41553640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41553640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tinco</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551892">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554089">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41553409">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41553640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41553640">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">MKBHD intentionally has a small team that makes relatively low budget videos.

Because I&#x27;ve spent almost a decade of my life hyper obsessing over YouTube, I can show a brand new creator how to go from 100 subscribers to 10,000 in a month. On their own it would take them years to do it. Consults are a gift from god, please take advantage of them. In every single freakin task assigned to you, always always always ask yourself first if you can find a consultant to help you. This is so important that I am demanding you repeat this three times in your head &quot;I will always check for consultants when I&#x27;m assigned a task&quot;&quot;</code></pre></div><br/><div id="41552118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SonOfLilit</span><span>|</span><a href="#41552069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552171">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552118">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a software consultant, so obviously biased.<p>MrBeast enters a new domain every week so consultants are way more important to him than to a software business.<p>He has enough budget and fame to, as he says, use the Guinness Word Records book as a phonebook.

When Mozart wrote piano trios for the public, his publisher cancelled the series after two pieces because they were judged far too difficult for the masses, and when Mozart intended to write some easy piano sonatas at the end of his life, the first (the only one he completed) turned out to be the most difficult he ever wrote.<p>Invoking the popularity of Shakespeare or Mozart as analogues to Mr Beast reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the longevity of both Shakespeare or Mozart, and leaves unmentioned the extensive body of difficult works on which their reputation rests today.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41553535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41553535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jrflowers</span><span>|</span><a href="#41550035">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41553415">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41550310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41553535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41553535">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I specifically said &quot;I am not calling for government intervention or any of such BS&quot; because I knew you are around and you are going to maliciously misunderstand me.<p>What does this mean?

I don&#x27;t get &quot;sponge bob square pants&quot; but there are people out that that insist it was if not a pinnacle of animation entertainment, then a hugely creative and entertaining show that deserves its place in the pantheons of animation. And all those huge 80&#x27;s era properties that so many have years of nostalgic memories of, like transformers, he-man or voltron were all &quot;cynical cash grabs&quot; and 30 minute commercials for toys. So much so the concerned parents of the time demanded the government step in. Now the jury might be out on whether that generation is worse than previous generations, but if they are I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be because transformers was a toy marketing gimmick instead of high art with a strong moral message.<p>Kids I know find all sorts of things ridiculously amusing and entertaining and it all seems stupid, brainless and mind rotting to me. But then again, the stuff I found ridiculously amusing and entertaining at that age was (I can attest, having gone back and watched some of it) was just as stupid, brainless and mind rotting. Some of it is not having a &quot;sufficiently developed palette&quot; for humor and entertainment. Some of it is because that humor and entertainment was genuinely new to me at the time, where as now I&#x27;ve seen it before so when it shows up in the kids stuff, it&#x27;s not entertaining anymore. It&#x27;s sort of the reverse of the &quot;Seinfeld isn&#x27;t funny&quot; issue. We&#x27;re not looking at something in the past and wondering why it was so great because it&#x27;s been out shadowed by what it inspired.

There was a lot of parental concern about the stuff the &quot;kids these days&quot; were consuming.<p>The 80&#x27;s gave us Transformers or Voltron. It gave us MTV and the rise of Nickelodeon.

There was a lot of parental concern about the stuff the &quot;kids these days&quot; were consuming, heck they got the federal government involved they were so concerned.<p>Bugs Bunny and Looney Tunes had people concerned for its mindless violence and effect on kids.

He knows youtube very well, but it&#x27;s clear from his other business ventures that he&#x27;s not good in other markets. I don&#x27;t think you can translate ALL the stuff there into other markets.<p>b) There&#x27;s a lot of unhealthy stuff mixed in with the parts that seem like they drive his success. If somebody does X, Y and Z and gets insane levels of success, they may not realize that it&#x27;s X and Y driving the success, and Z is actively harmful. But I guess it depends on what you consider &quot;harmful&quot; - some might think &quot;harmful&quot; means &quot;hurts the bottom line&quot; and some might think &quot;hurts those lowest on the rung&quot;. Either one of those might be true. It&#x27;s like people who think being an asshole like early Steve Jobs is the way to be a successful leader, when he arguably achieved more lasting impact when he mellowed out.<p>With that context, I think some of the critiques you mention have substance.<p>&quot;He&#x27;s making low value content&quot; -&gt; I think this is true, because he&#x27;s optimized for the market he&#x27;s in. I think it&#x27;s a legit critique that this strategies may not be sustainable or applicable to &quot;high value content&quot;. He even expressly says this: &quot;Not the highest quality videos.. It’s to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible.&quot;<p>&quot;the culture of the company is horrible&quot; -&gt; I absolutely think this is worth talking about, and I find it hard to see building a long term company on his approach. The myth that you need to push people to breaking points to be successful is poison.<p>&quot;he&#x27;s a fraud&#x2F;it&#x27;s more luck than skill&quot; -&gt; Well anyone saying that is just wrong. He obviously is very good at what he does.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good long term business strategy to depend so much on a single larger company, one who has a history of changing the algorithm without warning or explanation. But it&#x27;s a good, but painful, short term strategy, and he will come out of it perfectly fine whenever he suddenly becomes irrelevant. But there are others who won&#x27;t&#x2F;haven&#x27;t come out with much, and I think it&#x27;s good to have a discussion if this is right or not.<p>But there are good things there, the critical components, the importance of communication. The direct feedback of &quot;You are my bottleneck&quot; is good, but it easily could turn into passive aggression and ways to pass the buck. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty of low quality comments here, but don&#x27;t just write off all criticism as virtue signalling or whatever. There are def lessons in here, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s all above questioning.</div><br/><div id="41552598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41552598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ta_1138</span><span>|</span><a href="#41551180">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41552378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41554271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41552598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41552598">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s true that having to push people to the breaking point is poison.

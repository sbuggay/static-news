I understand people wanting to protect their culture but weird because it is self defeating.

Most people are like “wow, good for you, you’ve learned the language!”, but I have also, from a couple of gen Z folks, had accusations of being a coloniser and cultural appropriation… for learning the language of the country in which I live. I was surprised enough that I didn’t realise I was being accosted at first. As a crusty old millennial it never even occurred to me that learning someone’s language could be offensive to them. “Portuguese is for the Portuguese, not for foreigners!” was one of them. Strange how there’s this mix of anti-coloniser sentiment that actually seems to be or at least feed into anti-immigrant sentiment.<p>Bluntly, I think these people are idiots, and safely ignored.</div><br/><div id="41565565" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41565565" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">orwin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41564520">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41565305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41564977">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41565565">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41565565">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Bluntly, I think these people are idiots, and safely ignored.<p>I think they should be listened to, acknowledged, then ignored.

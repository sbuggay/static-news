In my case, calculus introducing new concepts (for which I didn&#x27;t have a practical use, so it was even more confusing) and probability theory get less intuitive was that wake-up call. Well, that alongside an ASM course with a toolchain that I couldn&#x27;t easily get working on my computer, or working with Prolog in similar circumstances, or understanding that I&#x27;ve underestimated how long making a 2D simulation project in C++ for extra credit would take, if I need to have collision detection and some physics for a soccer example.<p>That said, in my Master&#x27;s studies, once I got to specialize in the things that were of more interest to me, I ended up graduating with a 10&#x2F;10 evaluation for the thesis and 9.87&#x2F;10 weighted average grade across the subjects. That&#x27;s not like a super big achievement from a small regional university, but definitely goes to show that learning some things was easier for me than others.

I somewhat lazily skated through high school, and got a mix of 4s and 5s on AP exams. I did the exact same thing in college, with no change to my work&#x2F;learning ethic, and lazily skated my way to finishing my 4-year molecular bio degree in 3 years, with a GPA of like 3.5 or so. Then I went to grad school, did more of the same for two years, and won an award for having the 2nd best masters thesis produced by the university that year.<p>Then I got a great job in my field doing cancer research, did that for 5 years, then jumped careers entirely and now work in robotics.<p>But you know what? I feel like I&#x27;m constantly surrounded by people smarter than me. I&#x27;m not some brilliant person, I&#x27;m just some dude that when presented with some problem, things just seem to make sense for a path forwards, and maybe my special thing is that I just always go explore that path and learn that either I was right or why I was wrong and that just pays dividends. When I see people around me who work hard at things, who study and memorize and read papers, they impress the heck out of me, because I really struggle to do the same thing. And when I do, I really struggle to absorb any information; if something doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, it&#x27;s like it just passes out of my head. I have to do&#x2F;build&#x2F;try it to make it make sense a lot of the time, or at least have things framed in a way that just intuitively makes sense for me.<p>Anyway, my point is that maybe I was the top 99.99% of <i>something</i>, because, clearly I was&#x2F;am pretty good at some things that apparently most &quot;gifted&quot; people struggle with. But I never got a 4.0, I never aced all my classes, and I never really cared to as long as I felt I was getting what I needed to out of the classes.

Raising children has a way of making you more efficient. In my pre-child years there were days where I could putter around and relax because I knew I could make up the work later in the evening or even a weekend. Or at least that’s the lie we tell ourselves in the moment.<p>Post-kid, things come into focus. You learn how to do the work now whether you feel like it or not, because the price for doing it later becomes much higher.<p>I also was misled by all of the internet comments about how parenting and raising kids is awful and everyone secretly hates it despite their fake happy social media posts. After having kids you realize you actually like your kids and want to spend more time playing with them. That alone is motivation to get work done now so you don’t have to sacrifice the valuable kid time later.<p>It’s hard to explain until you get there, but I’ve talked to many other parents who went through the same growth phase. I’ve also caught up with some (not all, <i>some</i>) of my old friends from high school who were academic superstars but who did not have kids, and it’s remarkable to observe how some (again, don’t flame me, not all) of them are stuck in the low motivation&#x2F;low effort loop and cite that as one of their reasons for not having kids. To each their own, but I for one am glad I ignored the internet&#x2F;Reddit rhetoric about how kids are an impossible burden that will only make your life worse.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41343222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41343222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jcpst</span><span>|</span><a href="#41339152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41344452">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41344162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41343222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41343222">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; And if I’m struggling, as someone who’s not burdened by having children to take care of or even not having the most demanding job or hours to make ends meet, I have no idea how others manage to have a curious mind and succeed the way they do.<p>Paradoxically, I _feel_ like I have more time after I had kids than before. This is of course, after YOB (year of baby- first 12mo).<p>You see, I experienced such small slices of free time during YOB, that I became way more efficient at a ton of stuff, and dropped things that were time wasters.<p>Because I reproduced, I needed more dough. After working 3 jobs, 90 hrs a week for long enough, I decided to study programming.<p>Went to a code boot camp and walked out with a job. But the grinding didn’t stop there. What followed that was years and years of grinding, and studying as much as possible outside of programming at work.<p>Until finally, I got where I was going. I climbed up the ladder until I got tired of climbing, and avoided more stressful and time-demanding roles like management. I get senior dev compensation, don’t work more than 40hr&#x2F;week, and I don’t commute. This is the life I built.<p>For everything I pursue, there are others who can run circles around me.

Many people make the mistake of trying to memorize things without understanding. Which may be easy at the beginning when you memorize a fact or two, but it gradually accumulates, especially in math when the old topics never go away as the new ones are introduced. And then the memorizers are actually working much harder, and even that is not enough, so they fail.<p>So why the aversion to understanding? I suspect part of that is generational; if your parents sucked at math because they relied on memorization, they probably won&#x27;t introduce you to math as an something worth understanding. It will either be &quot;give up&quot;, or &quot;work harder&quot; but in the sense of memorizing harder. Not just your parents, but the entire culture around you will be like that. Another part is that most math teachers at elementary schools actually suck at math; because teachers are many, but people good at math are few and they have many better careers available. But another problem is the insistence of school system on everyone going forward at a predetermined speed -- sometimes understanding takes time, and when you don&#x27;t have the time, you are forced to memorize; but once you start memorizing, you usually need to keep memorizing, because understanding can only be built on understanding the prerequisites.<p>Properly taught elementary-school math should be fun, like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matika.in&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.matika.in&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a> Fun makes people think.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41345439" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41345439" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">creesch</span><span>|</span><a href="#41339201">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41343125">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41340063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41345439">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41345439">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very well put.

She wanted to go to engineering college and lacking the prerequisites she had to take their pre-course, ie all the math and physics required compressed in a year.

While not as strong as my SO, again similar story where persistence and working the foundations helped a lot, and she aced her somewhat easier college math course on time.<p>My friend was a bit different, in that he&#x27;d never been interested in math but had to take it to get the required points to get into some uni program he wanted. He&#x27;s fairly smart but struggled with motivation. So for him it required finding the right way of forming the questions so he got some motivation to solve it.<p>These are my most direct experiences, though I&#x27;ve also helped others here and there.

Active learning and deliberate practice will be covered in more depth in later posts, but below are some key points:<p>- Effective learning is active, not passive. It is not effective to attempt to learn by passively watching videos, attending lectures, reading books, or re-reading notes.<p>- Deliberate practice requires repeatedly practicing skills that are beyond one&#x27;s repertoire. However, this tends to be more effortful and less enjoyable, which can mislead non-experts to practice within their level of comfort.<p>- Classroom activities that are enjoyable, collaborative, and non-repetitive (such as group discussions and freeform&#x2F;unstructured project-based or discovery learning) can sometimes be useful for increasing student motivation and softening the discomfort associated with deliberate practice -- but they are only supplements, not substitutes, for deliberate practice.<p>- Deliberate practice must be a part of a consistent routine. The power of deliberate practice comes from compounding of incremental improvements over a longer period of time. It is not a &quot;quick fix&quot; like cramming before an exam.

But even math talents don&#x27;t learn it that way: as one, I was usually ahead of the school with my own reasoning (sometimes by a couple of grades) and could backtrack to the school method to understand it and apply it.<p>Second, if you are good at maths naturally, everything else at school becomes easier: people simply treat you as &quot;smart&quot; in whatever you do just because you have a natural leaning to mathematics (both if they do or don&#x27;t themselves). Even rote memorization subjects like history and geography become easier since, well, you are &quot;smart&quot;: teachers simply do not ask much of you.<p>And finally, I&#x27;ve met many an extremelly intelligent mathematician (uni professors and math competitors) who simply are outright <i>dumb</i>: they could not process a simple logic statement in human language, even if they were regularly working on advanced research calculus.<p>So, anyone can learn a lot of math, and doing so requires internalizing the foundations. However, people talented for mathematics find it easy to internalize them in various ways (not always the textbook way), so it&#x27;s not hard work for them (eg. I could coast through the entire undergrad math and CS program too, cramming for a weekend for all but a couple of exams: memorizing all the axioms and theorems was the struggle, operating with them and proving them once I knew them was comparatively easy and I finished with a GPA equivalent of 3.4 or so).<p>But math instruction is hard because math is a formal language representing a very specific mindset that not everybody can <i>naturally</i> get. And instruction is usually performed by people not having attained that internalized knowledge of the foundations, thus not being able to look at it and describe it from numerous viewpoints required for individual students.<p>Finally, we need to fix the society not to equate &quot;good at maths&quot; with &quot;being smart&quot;: plenty of smart people who have a hard time with maths, and plenty of math wizards who are outright dumb.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41344263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41344263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ksec</span><span>|</span><a href="#41345063">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41343188">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41344263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41344263">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is what I dislike about Computer Science course ( BSc ) and much prefer Computer Engineering ( BEng ).

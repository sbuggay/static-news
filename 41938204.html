Try zooming into New Zealand, or even down to the South Island of New Zealand, and plot a decade start 2007 to 2017. You would be hard pressed to see the two city-levelling destroying earthquakes and one town destroying earthquake we had (Sep 2010, Feb 2011, Nov 2016).<p>I think the main issue is colour and scale. The magnitude is logarithmic, but the scale of the circles are not.<p>We experience earthquakes in New Zealand all the time. Th last one was 10 hours ago [1] with a total of three yesterday. So in places you would expect large quakes, you also get lots and lots of small ones.<p>On a side note, Google beta-tested their early earthquake warning system in New Zealand and it was opt-out. I had students diving under desks in a Deep Learning class because the warning sound emitted was very much like the govt. emergency SMS messages. It was a very minor quake, I am not sure we even felt it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geonet.org.nz&#x2F;earthquake&#x2F;weak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geonet.org.nz&#x2F;earthquake&#x2F;weak</a></div><br/><div id="41940650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41940650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beatthatflight</span><span>|</span><a href="#41939853">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41942230">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41940650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41940650">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I played with Kepler GL a couple of years ago to visualise the Canterbury quakes.

I am constantly annoyed by the zoom in&#x2F;out feature because it apparently doesn&#x27;t allow display of all longitudes from dateline to dateline, left to right. There appears to be a stripe of missing longitudes that one is only able to see if they zoom out one level so that large sections of the globe are repeated. This is not a complaint that is unique to this display, it is very common.<p>After pointing out that annoyance I hate to mention too that the data could use some cleaning of duplicate entries related to slight differences in focal locations.<p>One set of triplicates that demonstrates this is located east of Greenland and is visible when parameters are set to display &gt;6.5 magnitude quakes. The event is a 6.8 quake which occurs on 11&#x2F;8&#x2F;2018 at 7:49:40 pm UTC for an event at 10 km depth and there are three locations for the same event (one of them has a time stamp two seconds earlier but is unlikely to be a different event of the same magnitude).<p>I suspect that the display uses information from multiple sources that have not been cleaned for duplicates. I believe it would be difficult to identify all instances of duplication in a dataset like this for quakes of lower magnitudes especially.<p>Anyway, I like it but I did stumble on or against a couple of things that I thought noteworthy.<p>Good job overall, the easy part is done and it works and is a useful display.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41939779" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41939779" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saltcured</span><span>|</span><a href="#41942230">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41942764">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41939779">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41939779">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s very glitchy for me on firefox on linux, with many of the quakes not rendering or flickering as if they render in the wrong order and are covered by the base map.<p>The artifacts change randomly if I zoom and pan around, but it isn&#x27;t easy to control.

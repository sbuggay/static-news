Her point was somewhat limited to drug crimes, but she pointed out that if you look at medical data (where people tend to be fairly honest about their drug usage) pretty much everyone in the metro area under study (SF) used drugs, or at least drug use was equally prevalent in pretty much every geographical area and among all demographics. Therefore, when the cops went to a location to make drug arrests they typically succeeded, because it&#x27;s not hard to find drug crimes in the Bay Area.<p>The problem was that they then used that arrest data to make decisions about where to perform future searches and arrests. Because they found drugs where they had looked previously, they looked there again and found more drugs. This creates a bad feedback loop where they were basically busting the same neighborhoods and demographics over and over again, despite the fact that drug crime was prevalent everywhere. In effect it was an insufficiently explorative learning strategy, just hitting the same lever over and over. Dr. Lum&#x27;s point was that predictive policing software merely hides this dynamic under a layer of black-box ML crap. Because the training data is itself the result of this type of bad policing, the resulting model can only further engrain these practices, it can&#x27;t offer truly novel solutions.<p>Crime and criminology is complicated, but at the end of the day not that complicated. On the whole people commit crime because they are desperate (for money, for drugs, etc.), occasionally because they have an anti-social personality disorder. Applying all these abstract epidemic&#x2F;broken-windows type models which pretend like the root causes of crime are unknowable allows police to appear like they&#x27;re operating efficiently, while at the same time just responding to the symptoms rather than facing the sickness itself. Until we actually look at why crime occurs (mainly because poor people need money badly, secondly because people in sufficiently dire poverty stop caring about the social norms of the middle class) we won&#x27;t be able to make a meaningful difference.</div><br/><div id="37756697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37756697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">standardUser</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37762403">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37756697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37756697">[138 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;On the whole people commit crime because they are desperate&quot;<p>Great comment, but this line demands a response. When so many consensual acts are considered crimes, we end up with a situation where most people are commiting crimes because... they want to. They aren&#x27;t &quot;desperate&quot; to snort coke, or pay for a blowjob, or play an illegal card game, but they want to do those things and will do so regardless of the criminal status of that act. The only way that changes is by using extreme state violence under an authoritarian regime or, my preferred option, by changing the laws so every Tom, Dick and Harry isn&#x27;t committing a crime simply by living their lives.</div><br/><div id="37757904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37757904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IIAOPSW</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37756697">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37756988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37757904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37757904">[72 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ll chime in.<p>There&#x27;s 4 things we call &quot;crime&quot; and the only thing they have in common is that the state sends in an agent to physically restrain you from doing it.<p>1) Rational crime.

Eg getting behind the wheels of a car in the first place increases the chance of vehicular manslaughter (compared to walking).<p>Society can punish the probabilistically bad behaviour, or the bad outcome or any combination of the two (including none).<p>If the punishment is purely financial, and enforcement is certain and actors have deep pockets, it doesn&#x27;t really matter which combination you pick.<p>You can emulate the deep pockets by requiring people to get insurance.  Even if the law only polices the bad outcomes, a rational insurance company might want to police its customers behaviour.  (Eg your health insurance gives you a discount, if you show them evidence of healthy habits.  That&#x27;s equivalent to charging people who fail to provide that evidence more, but the discount is more PR friendly.)<p>Both driving at all and drunk driving increase the chance of a person committing vehicular manslaughter.  Societies largely allow driving, but ban drunk driving.<p>Drunk driving is dangerous, mainly because drunkards have slower reaction times and are more prone to taking risks.  The more alcohol you have in your blood, the harsher the fines and punishment.  But we typically don&#x27;t check people&#x27;s sober reaction times and risk appetite, and charge them more for driving sober.<p>It&#x27;s all about trade-offs.<p>In the case of vehicular accidents, most people don&#x27;t necessarily have deep pockets, and the damage of injuring or killing people can&#x27;t be undone by paying money.

If you choose to take them, you&#x27;re rolling the dice on where you&#x27;ll end up, and that makes it a crime with society as the victim.</div><br/><div id="37759005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37759005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OkayPhysicist</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758667">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37761729">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37759005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37759005">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Addiction potential is heavily tied to one&#x27;s circumstances. The more desperate the circumstances, the greater the abuse potential. For example, you specifically listed crack as opposed to run of the mill powder cocaine. The only difference between them from an abuse potential perspective is the purchasing power of the user. Likewise, the raver who&#x27;s popping some mystery mix of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA at a party once a month is far less likely to succumb to addiction than poor sap living in Redding where the only thing available for entertainment is smoking meth. Opiates are self-selecting in this regard: they&#x27;re not that pleasant relative to other drugs, except for their ability to make you content, which only really appeals to the desperate.<p>If we follow your &quot;it&#x27;s illegal because there&#x27;s a probability&quot; theory of law enforcement, then it should only be illegal to do drugs while poor, which is pretty much where the law stands today without the deceptive veneer of equality. Now, that should sound like an absurd legal take, because it is.

The federal system seems to be murkier, with 46% (67,000~) of inmates being their for drug related reasons. Unlike state breakdowns, drug crimes are differentiated here.

There are many, many sex workers who are perfectly happy doing their work, and I believe that these are the people you know (the book gives this group the tongue-in-cheek name &quot;happy hookers&quot;). However on the whole these people tend to be affluent and well-connected (which could also be extrapolated from knowing an HN poster), and as such get over-represented in our current sex-work discourse IMO. Responses like this, which use these &quot;happy&quot; sex workers to push back on the negative aspects of sex work experienced by people who <i>are</i> acting out of desperation obscures a lot of important nuance at play. No doubt that the moralizing &quot;all sex workers are abused and need saving&quot; is equally if not more harmful, but I think it&#x27;s really important that we acknowledge that for many people sex work is often just that: work (which is also the take of &quot;Revolting Prostitutes&quot;). Understanding it as a form of labor, subject to all the usual abuses of labor plus the extras unique to sex work is IMO a really important framing for thinking about sex work as a crime. This is where I&#x27;m coming from when I describe &quot;many&quot; sex workers as &quot;desperate&quot;; they are people who really need income doing the best work they can find (either best pay, most flexible hours, etc).

Maybe they&#x27;re doing this because they can&#x27;t afford the iPhone they want since all their savings went to rent and food, but I don&#x27;t think you can fully say that it&#x27;s purely &quot;desire&quot; causing them to act criminally.<p>Re the poor impulse control side of things, I think it would be very hard to isolate the causal direction between it and poverty.

You&#x27;re trying to find the logic in what they&#x27;re doing and putting yourself in their place to explain it with a logical reason, but you can&#x27;t conceive how different the world is for the low-IQ people looting and stealing and harming others. Their reasons for crime might be far different than the reasons you try and see based on what you might do in their shoes.<p>2) I think that simply explaining that current crime comes from poverty and needing money is an explanation that falls flat. Much of the human experience has been in immense misery or poverty that the poorest person living in the US today can&#x27;t even conceive of. Poor people in the US can still have TVs, smart phones, and more food than they can even eat. Poor people in the past used to literally sometimes die of starvation and have to choose whether or not they were willing to eat rotten food or hell, even rats or worse to survive. They had to risk working in extremely dangerous mines, factories, etc to barely eke out survival. Why didn&#x27;t these people casually turn to crime? They had it much worse! Would it ever be socially acceptable for large groups in the past to run amok and violently burglarize others? No, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s poverty. Something else about the world has changed other than &quot;poor people need money so they resort to crime.&quot;<p>3) My thinking is that something closer to an extremely high and increasing time-preference is what is causing a lot of these problems. Whether it&#x27;s through the influence of technology, apps, music&#x2F;movies&#x2F;tv and other cultural causes, many people have been conditioned to value the dopamine hit of immediate gratification far more than thinking about the long-term.</div><br/><div id="37758030" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37758030" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tech_ken</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37757318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37757938">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37758030">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37758030">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Why didn&#x27;t these people casually turn to crime?<p>Isn&#x27;t violent crime at an all time low, historically [0]?

Certainly any successful criminal able to evade arrest for a serious amount of time is probably quite intelligent. Pretending like everyone who decided to rob a liquor store at age 19 is some idiot brute whose sole motivation is acting like a thug I think is one of those convenient narratives that feels true, but which overlooks a lot of what would push a person to actually act that way.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrc.crim.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;manuel-eisner-historical-trends-in-violence.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrc.crim.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;manuel...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37757938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37757938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carlosjobim</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37757318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758030">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37762302">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37757938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37757938">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Would it ever be socially acceptable for large groups in the past to run amok and violently burglarize others?<p>The line between a raging horde of criminals and an army has been razor thin through history.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37762302" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37762302" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Kiro</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37757318">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37756779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37762302">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37762302">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now explain the rise of gang violence in Sweden, with kids queuing to become gang members.

I&#x27;ll walk back my claims with regard to things like domestic violence or violent crime resulting from a fight or something.  However there is still the large component of violent crime that is things like an armed robbery, for which I believe my claim applies. Somewhere else in the thread someone brought up the link between impulse control and poverty, which I think also has bearing here. Poverty has been documented to increase baseline stress, and I would imagine that someone working multiple part time jobs just to afford rent and food is going to have a way shorter fuse than like, some tech worker earning a quarter million a year, but that&#x27;s just speculation on my part.<p>&gt; We have a worker shortage! Fast food wages are higher than ever. Young men steal catalytic converters because it&#x27;s more fun and because they don&#x27;t want to work at stupid Dunkin Dounuts and wear a uniform like a nerd.<p>I see your point here, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s totally invalid, but I do think it fails to acknowledge the whole problem. For one, I think we would need to get some sense of how many people both work at DD <i>and</i> steal cats out of cars. I would imagine that it&#x27;s not a small fraction of the population. While slinging donuts probably pays more than petty crime, it also requires more time. If you&#x27;re already working one fast food job maybe you&#x27;re just going to augment that salary with some theft rather than take on another 20-30 hours of work. There&#x27;s also the pride factor, FF jobs can feel very degrading whereas some varities of crime are self-employment, you get to set your own hours and working conditions. Additionally FF jobs may not even hire you if you&#x27;ve already got a conviction or consume certain drugs.<p>I do overall agree that there is some cultural stuff at play, a young man who grows up in a poor neighborhood and meets a lot of criminals is likely going to feel pressured to himself start committing crimes, but I also have to ask if you can truly blame someone for making that choice and if it makes sense to separate that choice from an overall feeling of desperation? If you&#x27;re a young man who believes he has absolutely no prospects whatsoever to actually &quot;succeed&quot; following the typical career path then that means you have little to lose, and coming from that mindset I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s totally unreasonable to say &quot;fuck it&quot; and start operating outside the law, even if it pays less than slinging burgers. Desperation breeds disaffectation, which in turn results in seriously anti-social behavior. If coolness was the only factor every affluent suburbanite teenager would also be cutting catties, but clearly that&#x27;s not the case. Yes the ultimate consequence is something more than &quot;I just need money so I&#x27;m going to turn to crime&quot;, but the underlying agitation which kicks off the chain of events is often socioeconomic disadvantage.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37757286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37757286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dionidium</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753745">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37753398">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37757286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37757286">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They say that:<p>&gt; <i>In 2021, The Markup published an investigation in partnership with Gizmodo showing that Geoliticaâs software tended to disproportionately target low-income, Black, and Latino neighborhoods in 38 cities across the country.</i><p>But you should understand what is meant by &quot;disproportionately&quot; in this context.

There are also some guardrails; your lawyer can&#x27;t lie about facts they&#x27;ve found out during that investigation, for example. If they do, they can be sanctioned for it. So they can&#x27;t just try and win at all costs.<p>With all that said, I think the original point still stands: in most people&#x27;s minds, an &#x27;ideal&#x27; system is one where all the lawyers are trying to seek justice. We just create a less-than-ideal adversarial system as a weak proxy for that given that human nature tends to make the ideal an unreliable expectation. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s fundamentally different from the PD transparency issue.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37753918" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37753918" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnimalMuppet</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753398">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37754024">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37753851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37753918">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37753918">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But even if they had used it as intended, how could you tell whether it <i>works</i>?

Even in this case, where the parallel evidentiary construction is presumably legitimate, one can imagine the problem - a jury may put more stock in a ShotSpotter result than the cop&#x27;s testimony about a bullet.

Once you can generate random trajectories in air for a representative distribution of initial bullet speeds, it <i>should</i> be relatively simple to transform these to relative pulse arrival times at a 3D array of microphone locations.<p>For precise pulse arrival times one may wish to look at &quot;constant fraction discriminaors&quot;, so that for rising pressures of the pulse, the timing is independent of pulse strength.<p>For decentralized analysis, and compatibility with the courts it would be best if it didn&#x27;t output a &quot;Holy Answer&quot;, but instead computes an interpretation of the recordings and why it believes in the trajectory it heard, so that at all times an alternative interpretation with a better fit can be proposed, and algorithms improved. This would require the decentralized code to effectively run a formal verifier on the audio evidence backed proof. Reimplementing the metamath verifier on a decentralized blockchain should work.<p>The devices themselves would best be constructed by and for the population, with individuals selected at random, trained to understand how the device works, and then implementing it and its security envelope.<p>It would be best if the protocol allowed new concerned citizen to continuously join the protocol, to use <i>threshold cryptography</i> so that the police can only consult the recordings with permission of civilian population, keeping an eye on how often they request to check for a bullet when there was none (some should be tolerated, but bulk collection denied).<p>The devices should store candidate recordings in a rotating buffer overwriting older &#x2F; less probable bullet recordings, but always encrypted towards the group by treshold cryptography. These on-device recordings should be considered a backup failsafe only in case internet connectivity disappears. The usual operation is to (immediatly) send the encrypted shards to the group of civilians running the protocol (for time stamping purposes). Individuals or small groups can not decode the recordings on their own, only with sufficient ( K out of N ) civilians agreeing the recordings should be published can they be published, in which case that recording is public for all (including the police). Either everyone gets to hear the shots fired, or no one. Regarding the agreement procedure: that too would use formal verification, the rules and conditions when civilians are supposed to agree should fall under democratic control, and the user agent (software client) the civilians run automatically release or withhold according to these rules. Unreliable citizens that refuse to release their share of the secret when they are supposed to, or leak their share of the secret when they are not supposed to are temporarily banned from participating in the protocol (and will for such duration no longer be remunerated for their participation). This means you don&#x27;t get cliques of interested parties joining up in large numbers amid a disinterested and unincentivized population cherry picking when to release a recording or not (by modifying the source code of their local client in order to cherry pick against due process when to release the recordings).</div><br/><div id="37758619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37758619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">walterbell</span><span>|</span><a href="#37753762">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758588">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37754336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37758619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37758619">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks, this is super helpful, especially the civilian and clique game theory scenarios.

For example, in Minority Report, the accuracy of the crime predictions is assumed to be perfect, and the result is that they are always incorrect.  No crimes are committed because the intervention is always successful (at least up to the point where the story starts).  So you might consider &#x27;never have to make an arrest&#x27; to be a perfect record for such a system, as in minority report.  You might equally logically take &#x27;always makes an arrest&#x27; as proof a system like this is working.<p>You also have to worry about crime moving around to avoid the police.  Maybe the bank robbery was going to happen at BoA, but they drove by and saw a bunch of police and robbed the Wells Fargo 20 minutes away instead.<p>As silly as it probably sounds, probably the best heuristic to get a good idea of whether a system like this works is the feedback police give after spending time following it&#x27;s leads.  If they say this thing is predicting where they need to be better than whatever they did before, and there isn&#x27;t an obvious correlation to the predictions (as in, it doesn&#x27;t always send them to the black neighborhood) then it probably warrants more careful analysis.  In this case the police thought the system was crap.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37757419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37757419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnadaP</span><span>|</span><a href="#37758122">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37756563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37757419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37757419">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You have to choose between:<p>- accurate and politically incorrect<p>- inaccurate and politically correct</div><br/></div></div><div id="37756563" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37756563" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">epivosism</span><span>|</span><a href="#37757419">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758951">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37756563">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37756563">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This story is so far down the argument about crime, it&#x27;s ridiculous.  This is my interpretation of what&#x27;s going on:<p>stage 1: Most people know where the dangerous neighborhoods are.  Police know this, locals know this, and police send patrols there, or they avoid the area and leave poor&#x2F;minorities to fend for themselves.<p>stage 2: Someone runs the query: &quot;select race_distribution from patrol_history&quot; and finds police patrol certain racial areas more or less, and sues the department.  Media simultaneously writes stories like &quot;Police are harassing the population from group X&quot; or &quot;Police are abandoning protecting X areas&quot;. So the police look for &quot;scientific&quot; methods to choose where to dispatch officers since they can&#x27;t put down on paper what everyone knows - that the rent-controlled&#x2F;low wage&#x2F;etc areas are dangerous.  After all, most victims of crime here are locals - random kids, storekeepers, innocent people, people mistaken for someone else, or killed to show bravado.<p>stage 3: The software looks at obvious things like past history of crime, arrests, poverty, drug use detected in water, low academic achievement, gunshot detection devices<i>, etc. It&#x27;s </i>all* correlated.  So it finds the thing everyone knew - that certain areas of cities have much more open crime, and it would actually do good to increase the feeling of security around there, scare off drug dealers and people with warrants etc.  So they send police to those areas; Either to harass the people, exploit them, or to help protect them.  Both cases happen - i.e. in Ferguson, the police were using street crime as an excuse to harass and ticket local minorities in a disproportionate way (according to the justice dep&#x27;t investigation). But, there also actually was a lot more genuine violent crime there (which they police may not have even been helping out with).  And in other cities, police are correctly going to areas which need protection, and are wanted by the majority of the local population. See surveys on high rates of minorities saying they actually want more police protection, referenced in the book Ghettoside by Jill Levoy; white liberals typically are more anti-police than black people actually living in the dangerous areas.  But either way, the media can spin it as a negative - both under- and over- policing.<p>stage 4: activists &quot;debunk&quot; the crime prediction software, but if you read the debunking, it&#x27;s obvious motivated BS.  None of this is necessary. Take a video camera to the tenderloin and look at the state of the people. I don&#x27;t need a PhD to know that this is a dangerous area for theft, violence, disease, etc.<p>In the end, nobody can admit that some areas need police more than others right now. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way forever, but it is the case now. Same way a high school needs at least one or two security officers, but an elementary school doesn&#x27;t.  Rather than fight to deny reality, how about we figure out how to stop lying to ourselves about what&#x27;s going on, and then get to work helping and protecting the kids who are trying to make it out of there, and immigrants who have no other place to live?  The book Ghettoside is highly recommended. It&#x27;s the story of a liberal journalist who works with a right-wing coded white detective in LA who nevertheless passionately works against the police&#x27;s internal system, and the local black population&#x27;s reasonable reluctance to trust him and testify, to find the black killer of the child of his fellow detective, a black man.  I learned a lot from this - things aren&#x27;t just a case of &quot;evil police &amp; good locals&quot; or the right-wing stereotyped &quot;evil poor and good police&quot; view. Both views miss the more realistic description: that the police abandoned protecting black people for a long time; black communities started to hate &amp; distrust the police for this &amp; other reasons. And so now, they are left without a good means to protect themselves except via local cultural behavior (bravado, vigilantism, etc.)  So the book is a call to greatly <i>improve</i> the protection black communities receive, with their own involvement, so that they do not have to do their own self-defense anymore.<p>* yes, there are lots of articles which claim &quot;gunshot detection devices&quot; are racist.  It&#x27;s hard for me to see that view, but if you refuse to admit that some areas are actually more dangerous than others, your only way out is to attack all reports and data that suggests it.<p>** I mention blacks but I&#x27;m actually making a cultural argument; if you look at culture in Appalachia, you see the same thing in whites.  Groups which don&#x27;t feel like part of the majority and are left to their own internal justice systems tend to have more violence, because the systems are  underground and covert. This applies regardless of race.  e.g. look at crime differences between Appalachian areas and the rest of Virginia.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cityrating.com&#x2F;crime-statistics&#x2F;virginia&#x2F;appalachia.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cityrating.com&#x2F;crime-statistics&#x2F;virginia&#x2F;appalac...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Its great advantage was protected mode. When there were memory bugs, instead of scrambling my hard disk it would seg fault. I&#x27;d get everything working perfectly on OS&#x2F;2. Then, I&#x27;d port it to Rational&#x27;s 286 DOS Extender, which also operated in protected mode. This would purge all the bugs in the compiler related to the mixed 16 bit memory model. Then the last step was to port it to real mode DOS.<p>OS&#x2F;2 saved me an enormous amount of debugging time.<p>I always laugh when people complain about null pointer seg faults. Those are a feature, not a bug. Finding bugs in your code immediately, rather than a few miles further down the road, is a great attribute.<p>Writing through a null pointer in real mode DOS meant overwriting the interrupt vector table. Probably the worst CPU architectural mistake of all time is locating that table at address 0. If you were lucky, DOS would just freeze up, and you could reboot it. If you were unlucky, it would scramble your hard disk, and you&#x27;d have to re-install the operating system and all your files.<p>The ROMs (i.e. boot address) should have been located at address 0, and the interrupt table at FFFFF.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39612633" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39612633" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sircastor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39613280">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39612315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39612633">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39612633">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My first job in tech was as a support rep for an ISP (a massive phone company that has been since consumed by an even larger phone company)<p>I must have answered thousands of phone calls, but one that sticks out in my memory was a guy who had selected Mac support not because he had a Mac, but because he was running OS&#x2F;2 Warp and he didn&#x27;t want to deal with a Windows support person - who might try to help him fix Windows instead of just giving him the information he needed (whatever ISP specifics). I&#x27;m pretty sure he related that information a couple of times, which made me feel that aside from wanting the specific info, he also just wanted to tell someone that he was running OS&#x2F;2 Warp. Or maybe have someone to appreciate how hard it was to be an outlier.<p>Those of us running non-MS Operating systems were of a type - thrown together because of our non-conformance.

It was well ahead of its contemporaries of the time.<p>Of course it wasn&#x27;t all roses, like the contemporaries of the era it had issues, which would be more prominent if more people had used it. It&#x27;s worth remembering that, by todays standards, in the late 80s, computers were rare. Most businesses didn&#x27;t have one at all, most homes certainly didn&#x27;t (and a significant portion of those that did were not-Dos machines.) My Computer Science class of 1990 mostly consisted of folk who&#x27;d never touched a computer before. No-one I knew had an Apple Mac, they were expensive.<p>Windows 95 wasn&#x27;t as good as OS&#x2F;2 3.0 (aka Warp), but it marketed the idea of computers to the general public. Only once the 486 shipped did you start to see computers as &quot;normal&quot;. But even by the end of the 90s we&#x27;d sell hardware when selling software.<p>I&#x27;d argue that we&#x27;re absolutely in the future that OS&#x2F;2 envisaged. Ultimately all paths converged and (probably starting with XP) we&#x27;ve been living that future.</div><br/><div id="39613166" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39613166" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">VagabundoP</span><span>|</span><a href="#39612315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39612367">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39613166">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39613166">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Late 80s computers were fairly common in Ireland, 386&#x27;s and Mac&#x27;s, although as you say mostly non-Dos, Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari and some other exotics.<p>We had a computer lab in my very run down school that has Macs and Apple IIs. My family were working class, if you had an interest there was a network of computer enthusiasts who would happy swap stuff, get you hardware etc. We bought a second hand 386 from somewhere, then fucked it up trying to add more memory I think. I was only a kid, but my dad saw me self learning BASIC and would encourage that sort of thing.<p>If this was happening in 80s Ireland I&#x27;d be surprised to learn they were rare in other countries, we weren&#x27;t exactly doing well at that point.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39612367" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39612367" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tadfisher</span><span>|</span><a href="#39612315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39613166">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39612866">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39612367">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39612367">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What&#x27;s interesting to me is that we ended up with NT&#x27;s Win32 personality as the default and only userland.

Clearly he has opinions. But for example in point 3, he says he can predict which exhibition will be great based on how easy it is to work with the artist. He predicts that some exhibition will be crap and he is right! Which sounds impressive until you notice that he is not measuring his judgement against something objective, but just against his judgement. He decides something will be crap and then he feels crap about it once he sees it. Did others, who did not know that the artist was slow to email back also feel that those exhibitions were mediocre and the others not? Who knows? All we have is this one man’s opinion. Maybe others thought differently.<p>Even more so in his point 6. He writes “What you see in the biographies of great artists, great writers, great anything is that they are good at figuring out where the vectors align.” Which is just plainly and absolutely not true. There were plenty of people who we now recognise as “great artist” who absolutely could not figure out where the “incentive vectors align”. Thus they lived in abject poverty, or needed to support themselves from something other than their art. But if your definition of “great art” is that it is commercially succesfull then of course what you will find that the “great artist” are all like good businesman. But that doesn’t tell you about what it take to be an artist, just only what you value.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42303027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grammarxcore</span><span>|</span><a href="#42304019">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42304004">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303027">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I refuse to believe that not answering every single email within an hour is a good predictor of anything other than being glued to your phone. I think extending it to a reasonable amount of time, maybe a business day max, works out pretty well. Sometimes people respond really fast because they’re taking regular breaks and other times they don’t respond all evening because they’re putting on their kid’s birthday party. Even at work, sometimes very good colleagues are doing things back-to-back for hours and using short windows to do things like go to the bathroom.<p>On the other hand maybe this is some art thing I’m too far away from to understand? Maybe really good artists to work with never need more than twenty minutes of deep focus at a time for anything?</div><br/><div id="42303817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42303817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bleakenthusiasm</span><span>|</span><a href="#42303027">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42303692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42303817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42303817">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I read this as &quot;answer within the hour when preparing an exhibition&quot;.

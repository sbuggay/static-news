It&#x27;s way too easy even for totally unfunded volunteers. The situation in science right now is reminiscent of the situation in computer security circa 1999. Back then there were so many easily exploited RCE vulns in foundational infrastructure that &quot;hacked by teenagers&quot; became a TV trope. Almost anyone could sit down and find a way to hack into a network without much effort. Vendors engaged in a lot of screaming and denial, sometimes even attacking the people who found exploits for them.<p>But, the industry changed. White hats became widespread, companies hired those ex-teenage hackers in their thousands. They put every employee through trainings. Then when that wasn&#x27;t enough they started paying out millions in bug bounties, buying sandboxing companies (like Google did for Chrome) and more. Companies did this because bad security was hurting their reputations and in a competitive market that is an exploitable weakness. It was a form of self defense.<p>Academic science is excluded from market mechanisms by legal fiat, supposedly on the basis that this will yield better research outcomes. What it&#x27;s actually done is shield universities from any need to make hard changes. Their reputation is tanking but they just don&#x27;t seem to care and why should they? They&#x27;ll get grants from the NIH anyway because they&#x27;re all as bad as each other, and nobody in politics is talking about a total defunding of the sector yet.<p>Unfortunately even if the grants were cut off tomorrow they probably would still find it hard to change. It&#x27;s becoming apparent that if a culture tolerates fraud for decades then eventually the leadership of these institutions are people who got there through fraud. How are universities or journals going to reform when the people who run them know full well they can&#x27;t crack down on fraud without exposing their own career to audit risk?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40593045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wang_li</span><span>|</span><a href="#40592884">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594925">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593648">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593045">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This kind of fraud should carry a prison sentence.</div><br/><div id="40593396" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593396" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">datahack</span><span>|</span><a href="#40592884">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593045">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40593648">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593396">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593396">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Absolutely.

- Add another layer of blindness: the person doing the lab work is not the person crunching the results. It could even be where two different groups crunch the numbers, and all groups are unknown to the others. 
- Avoid p hacking with pre determined (and registered!) p values
- Register the experiment with hypothesis before the start of the experiment 
- Register authors as they are added and removed, and have that history be publicly available
- All results have to be uploaded to a website before publication
- The method of calculation has to be public on a website before publication.<p>So a high quality paper is one where
- the experiment was logged in advance
- the history of authors is known
- there is a distinct separation of experimenter and cruncher 
- the public can get the results themselves and run the same analysis to confirm (or not!) the results
- the experiment is repeated and confirmed by others. Even if the first experiment is bad or a fraud, and the second one doesn’t confirm it, a third experiment could be the tie breaker. It would be more traceable to understand if it was the lab or the cruncher that made a mistake or was committing fraud.<p>Overall, we have to incentivize good science.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40592968" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40592968" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bagels</span><span>|</span><a href="#40593648">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40592968">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40592968">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Elisabeth Bik has a twitter where, at least in the past, she exposed a bunch of questionable things in papers (lots of manipulated images or images copied from other papers)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MicrobiomDigest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MicrobiomDigest</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MicrobiomDigest&#x2F;status&#x2F;902016709019672577" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;MicrobiomDigest&#x2F;status&#x2F;902016709019672577</a><p>These efforts are just going to accelerate with AI applied, new and exciting frauds will be discovered.</div><br/><div id="40593421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40593421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">etrautmann</span><span>|</span><a href="#40592968">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40594019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40593421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40593421">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, but AI tools also make it easier for bad actors to generate false images that are harder to detect as false going forward.

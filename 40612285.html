To me, the message &quot;it no longer exists&quot; is not the work of someone who, in trying to make layman understand, overdid it.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s the typical kind of mistake made by writers who forget about context.<p>From the programmer&#x27;s perspective, I speculate, the error _is_ indeed a case of something being non-existent. The code is written to fetch something from the server, the server says it&#x27;s not there, and well, the application should tell the user about it.<p>Within the very narrow context of fetching it from the server, &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; is correct. However, in the context of the user who&#x27;s sitting there looking at the message, &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; is simply false.<p>The message needs to be re-contextualized, such that it makes sense. &quot;The message doesn&#x27;t exist on the server, it exists on your computer at the moment, but just for a short while, so you better copy it&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the user understand what a &quot;server&quot; is. Simply knowing that the message doesn&#x27;t exist [at some place], is enough to make the whole sentence sensible.<p>Like if I go to a car mechanic, who just points to the whole car and say &quot;it&#x27;s gonna be replaced&quot;, it would be confusing. But if he says that &quot;xxx is gonna be replaced&quot;, that&#x27;s perfectly comprehensible, even if I don&#x27;t know what xxx is.</div><br/><div id="40615116" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40615116" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LoganDark</span><span>|</span><a href="#40613728">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40615116">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40615116">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;This message cannot be downloaded because it no longer exists on the server.

If it doesn’t exist why do I have to discard it??<p>Maybe it should be even less descriptive.<p>&quot;This message will soon no longer be available. Make sure you copy the contents of the message before you discard if you want to use them later.&quot;<p>Talking about the cache doesn&#x27;t help the user. Really the solution is to add a button at the end of the message that says &quot;save message contents to device.&quot; Then the message is clear and easily actionable.</div><br/><div id="40613956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40613956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">directevolve</span><span>|</span><a href="#40613671">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40613435">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40613956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40613956">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The message could also give both this actionable advice and lisper&#x27;s more technical explanation.

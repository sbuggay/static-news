Here we tend to ventilate only once the fire is under control rather than during the rescue and initial attack stages. Cutting a hole in a roof to ventilate a fire is never done. Breaking a window is very rare.<p>Instead, we tend to stay low and manage the overpressure layer with gas cooling. Short bursts from firefighting nozzles that use a spinning element to atomise the spray. These rapidly turn to steam, pulling heat out of the room with the expansion. Precision is very important as too much water or insufficient atomisation will create a sauna, lowering the survivability of the compartment.</div><br/><div id="39247778" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39247778" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FireBeyond</span><span>|</span><a href="#39246964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39246939">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39247778">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39247778">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Precision is very important as too much water or insufficient atomisation will create a sauna, lowering the survivability of the compartment.<p>To my sister comment, this is more of the same, things we know or think we do.

Firefighting is an area where there&#x27;s a lot of urban &quot;knowledge&quot; that is just straight ... wrong.<p>You have agencies like NIST and NFPA doing studies and science, but they also get often a bad rap from firefighters for being &quot;overly&quot; safety conscious. Ironic, considering that they did solid foundational work that saved firefighter lives (now, though, more die due to PTSD and mental illness and accumulated cancers than do in the line of duty).<p>I exaggerate not, I saw an ad for lateral firefighters to come work somewhere in the south:<p>&gt; Are you tired of being a firefighter in an OSHA state? Does your bunker gear smell of pallets and sadness? Do you really need someone to supervise you throwing a ladder? Come work for XYZ FD.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s the concept of &quot;flow path&quot; that is outdated. Firefighters believe(d) that by controlling the entrance of air&#x2F;oxygen and where it exits the structure or such, that you can create &quot;flow paths&quot; that the fire will follow, bypassing rooms and going down hallways for example, until it all defenestrates through a window or your vent hole. It does no such thing - it&#x27;s not lava flowing downhill with gravity.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of knowledge you gain on the job, often from the senior people. I tell new recruits that Fire Academy doesn&#x27;t teach you how to be a fireman, it teaches you how not to kill yourself and your brothers on the fireground.</div><br/><div id="39247751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39247751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JackMorgan</span><span>|</span><a href="#39246939">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39247094">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39247751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39247751">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I help at a fire academy in PA, and I can thankfully say at least we are teaching the latest from NIST, which recommends NOT applying PPV to a building fire. The material says that&#x27;s just adding ventilation to a ventilation limited fire, accelerating flashover.<p>Also there&#x27;s tons of discussion and practice around controlling doors and always keeping them closed to suffocate and contain the fire as much as possible. I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with seeing that taught, although a lot of places haven&#x27;t seemed to adopt these new recommended methods.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

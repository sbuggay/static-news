While the number of pixels per active line equal to 720 samples per line was not suggested until the next note, (720 is the number found in Rec. 601 and SMPTE 125), 720 is the first value that “works”. 716 is the first number greater than 715.5 that is divisible by 4 (716 = 4 x 179), but does not lend itself to standards conversion between 525-line component and composite colour systems or provide sufficiently small pixel groupings to facilitate special effects. Arguments in support of 720 were provided in additional notes prior to IBC in September 1980.<p>[…]<p>As noted above, Rec. 601 provided 720 samples per active line for the luminance channel and 360 samples for each of the colour-difference signals.<p>When the ITU defined HDTV, they stipulated: ‘the horizontal resolution for HDTV as being twice that of conventional television systems’ described in Rec. 601 and a picture aspect ratio of 16:9. A 16:9 picture ratio requires one-third more pixels than a 4:3 picture ratio. Starting with 720, doubling the resolution to 1440 and adjusting the count for a 16:9 aspect ratio leads to the 1920 sample per active line defined as the basis for HDTV [9].<p>Accommodating the Hollywood and computer communities’ request for ‘square-pixels’, meant that the number of lines should be 1920 x (9&#x2F;16) = 1080.<p>Progressive scan systems at 1280 pixels per line and 720 lines per frame are also a member of the ‘720-pixel’ family. 720 pixels x 4&#x2F;3 (resolution improvement) x 4&#x2F;3 (16:9 aspect ratio adjustment) = 1280. Accommodating the Hollywood and computer communities’ request for ‘square-pixels’, meant that the number of lines should be 1280 x (9&#x2F;16) = 720.<p>Therefore, most digital television systems, including digital video tape systems and DVD recordings are derived from the 4:2:2 basic standard format. The 720 pixel-per-active-line structure became the basis of a family of structures (the 720-pixel family) that was adopted for MPEG-based systems including both conventional television and HDTV systems.”</div><br/><div id="40082972" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40082972" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bestham</span><span>|</span><a href="#40079419">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076891">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40082972">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40082972">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought DVD only supported 4:3 anamorphic video with non square pixels for the correct playback aspect ratio.</div><br/><div id="40083567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40083567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Lammy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40079419">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40082972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40083589">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40083567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40083567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s true that 4:3 is also anamorphic on DVD since the 720×480 MPEG transport is a 3:2 resolution.

Most rippers crunch it down to 30FPS like Handbrake leads people to do.<p>— Convert the video to HD-standard color primitives, again to avoid cheap displays&#x27; poor treatment of SD colorspace.

And yeah, back in the day of Halo PC, modding the levels taught me a lot about what goes into the game.  Knowing what a &quot;BSP&quot; is can be a pretty useless piece of trivia, but it made me feel smart and capable of understanding more.<p>It&#x27;s still possible to get into tech and learn things today, but I have a hard time seeing how this can be accomplished by genuine tinkering.  Software is way harder to crack&#x2F;debug today; certainly not impossible, but the barrier of entry is much higher.  Plus there&#x27;s a ton of moving parts that go into getting software to work securely on not just mobile but modern desktops, adding another layer of hassle.  You can still examine what a webpage is doing, but even that has changed significantly; so many websites today are div soup (yes, worse than in the early 2000s) to support JavaScript monstrocities that are also minified and obfuscated.  When it comes to games, you can almost forget it in some cases because they&#x27;re so heavily dependent on content streaming from servers.  As far as hardware goes, you&#x27;ve either got to face various security hoops that can brick devices, use a heat gun to unglue the bezels on certain things, and face a lot more risk in permanent damage.<p>All of these changes were made for a reason, but we&#x27;ve also taken the fun out of everything.  Even game modding really wasn&#x27;t what it used to be in spite of some of the tools available today <i>technically</i> being better than those in the past.</div><br/><div id="40077051" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40077051" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somenameforme</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076919">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40077051">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40077051">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with you in general, but I think it has to be said that we also live in the era of things like the source for Unreal Engine 5 being completely and wholly available, along with a zillion tutorials and extremely well documented source. This is unlike anything we had, and better in basically every single way imaginable. In the hardware world there&#x27;s Pi&#x27;s, dirt cheap PCBs that you can have delivered in &lt; 24 hours, and so on endlessly. It&#x27;s like instead of breaking into a trailer, we&#x27;ve all been granted carte blanche access to a mansion.<p>But maybe there was something about how counter-culture and esoteric stuff was itself attractive precisely because of that. There was also a lot more reward for a lot less work, largely because so few people were doing it. Now if somebody wants to go learn Unreal then it&#x27;s just a pretty mundane and common thing, and you&#x27;ll also be largely incompetent unless you&#x27;re willing to dedicate years to it. By contrast when I was a kid changing the text in a shareware installer was enough to wow my friends with my leet skills, and that&#x27;s something that took about 5 minutes to do, and not that much longer to learn. Oh and then creating secret directories by naming them alt+255, and so on.

Nothing about a Raspberry Pi, for instance, is mysterious.  If a person is going to buy one, they already have a significant level of interest and base knowledge.  A kid&#x27;s not gonna have one lying around and get curious about it unless their parent is a geek who owns those things, and even then said kid may have no good reason to even bother with one.  Practically nobody today is opening up their laptop or their phone to mod it or even just see what&#x27;s inside.  I&#x27;m not saying the modern situation is bad, but a significant amount of it is artificial in a way that wasn&#x27;t when the devices one would play with were the devices actually being used, and it&#x27;s not clear to me whether what we have now is actually better in regard to inspiring future generations.

As you observed, the tech has also evolved in ways which make it relatively undiscoverable through casual tinkering. Although perhaps we suffer from a generational perspective bias, I think there really was a &#x27;golden era&#x27; of computer tech hobbyist accessibility and discoverability.<p>When Did the &#x27;Golden Era&#x27; Begin?<p>I&#x27;d peg it as starting around the late Usenet era. Interestingly, there was definitely a time period in consumer computer tech when it was too early. I know because I started &quot;too early&quot; and missed being a teenager in the golden era because I got my first computer as a teenager in 1981. It was a Radio Shack Color Computer with 4K of memory, a 0.9 Mhz 8-bit 6809 processor and storage via an external cassette tape player. Fortunately, the ROM BASIC on that model was perhaps the most evolved 8-bit ROM BASIC Microsoft ever made (vs the early Commodore &amp; Atari flavors) and Radio Shack did a fantastic job on the large, well-illustrated color manuals.<p>Unfortunately, 1981 was too early because no one in my family&#x27;s extended social network had ever touched a computer. So, beyond the BASIC manual in the box, I was on my own with my new computer. While there were a few big magazines like BYTE on news stands, very little in them applied to my computer. I eventually discovered a couple of zine-style publications at a distant big news stand. Although they were essentially overgrown stapled newsletters printed in B&amp;W, they became my lifeline because they had articles written by hobbyists more advanced than I, as well as mail-order ads for cassette tape-based software. This was the key that unlocked the mysterious realm of assembly language for me when I ordered a $12 homebrew monitor program written by some random guy who took out a classified ad. The local library didn&#x27;t have any books relevant to my new microcomputer, local colleges only offered computer courses under the math dept and those were focused on mainframes and COBOL (I think back then &#x27;real&#x27; CompSci was limited to Ivy League and top tier tech unis). Even large bookstores had nothing useful to me I could order other than Osborne&#x27;s 6809 CPU book which was really an architecture and instruction set reference manual mostly incomprehensible to an isolated teenage hobbyist starting out.<p>A few years later 300 baud modems became cheap enough for hobbyists to acquire but it took another year or so for BBSes to emerge which were targeted at my computer (most BBSes prior to that were run on CP&#x2F;M hardware and focused on one platform (not mine)). So dialing BBSes focused on my platform involved long-distance charges which meant short calls. Another year later FidoNet connected larger BBSes and national-level info began to circulate and my local hobby scene stayed pretty much like this for a few years. New info centered around zines, local computer club meetings, mailed tapes &amp; diskettes and short BBS calls. Info was available but it was scarce and you had to work at getting it.<p>That&#x27;s why I think the true golden era truly took off in the late Usenet period. That&#x27;s when anyone could subscribe to a ~$10&#x2F;mo service providing 1200 baud access to Usenet feeds in their local area code. Before that, unless you were at a university studying CompSci or worked at a uni or large tech company, Usenet was a magical land you only heard about on BBSes or at user group meetings. When random home hobbyists got direct access to the firehose of high-quality, global Nerdverse content that was the Usenet CompSci feeds it felt like the Enlightenment dawning. From there the transition to the early web was pretty natural since a lot of early tech-centric websites were much like a BBS ring. We didn&#x27;t need search because they mostly linked to each other and people were running them as a hobby so few had ads other than maybe a sponsorship from an ISP or modem company (usually just paid in free service or hardware). Fortunately, the tech hobbyist web wasn&#x27;t impacted much by the 2001 dot com crash since it was never about revenue. Up until the slow decline gradually started in the mid-2000s, it was pretty great - flashing BLINK tags and all. Honestly, we didn&#x27;t even realize how good we had it, or imagine that it might someday end.<p>When Did the &#x27;Golden Era&#x27; End?<p>Having lived through the pre-Golden Era, the early days and through the end, I think the seeds of the Golden Era&#x27;s slow decline were planted when the modern web business began to emerge from the ashes of the dot com crash. Although things were still pretty hobbyist-discoverable in desktop OSes and the web through 2010-ish, troubling signs were on the horizon. For those paying attention, the rapid dominance of iOS in the late 2000s was ominous. Apple&#x27;s business model required a walled garden app store and their concept of users was not as active explorers but as purely passive eyeballs for media and app-snacking. Even though a few app developers did well in the early app store, the fundamental model relegated them to the role of sharecroppers working Apple&#x27;s farm with Apple&#x27;s tools and selling only to Apple&#x27;s store (with no access to their app&#x27;s end-users).<p>In all, entry-level, home-based tech hobbyists got almost 20 really amazing years in the &#x27;Golden Era&#x27; from roughly the late 80s to the late 2000s. It would be wonderful if in the distant future that period is known as &quot;The First Golden Era&quot; but right now it&#x27;s hard to be optimistic. While there is still an enormous amount of hobbyist info available online and more emerging, it&#x27;s in a context of equally increasing locked down areas and ever decreasing discoverability (though open source and Github-like sites are notable exceptions).<p>Maybe this is why retro computing and retro gaming are booming now with new people who never experienced it the first time. It&#x27;s a place where that unique Golden Era ethos, vibe and community still exists. Last year I went to a local user group meeting for Amiga computers, which is what I had mid-80s to early 90s. I met a bunch of enthusiastic Amiga users who hadn&#x27;t been born when I bought my first Amiga. It was strange to feel both &quot;old&quot; and &quot;OG Cool&quot; at the same moment but also heartening to feel that same open community vibe still beating. :-)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40078339" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40078339" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bee_rider</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076871">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40078715">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076715">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40078339">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40078339">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They’ve got, with wildly varying levels of skill and investment: unity, unreal, godot, or Roblox.<p>Not quite as fun as modding though.</div><br/><div id="40078404" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40078404" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anonymousab</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40078339">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076715">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40078404">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40078404">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think adding your own touch to something you&#x27;re more intimately familiar with helps ease people into it.

You&#x27;d invite your friends to your party and then start the match-making process. During the whole process you could chat with your friends, and when the game ended, you were still a party and could talk to each other.<p>- Chat. Everyone had an Xbox Live headset which came with the service. So everyone was a participant of party chat, in-game team chat, and even &quot;proximity chat&quot; with the enemy. With Halo 2&#x27;s chat systems + Xbox Live headset ubiquity, it was a highly social game.<p>- Split screen online. All of the above worked with playing with a friend in split screen. Your friend could come over and you could start Team Slayer matchmaking in split screen which was awesome—the game would have to find two more teammates—, and your guest could even chat. Something that could never be done on PC really.<p>These dominated the old &quot;look for and join the server&quot; model of past FPS and, frankly, I could never go back to that.<p>Gameplay wise, Halo 1 had most of the innovations that Halo 2 capitalized on but Halo 2 moved to the pure shield-is-your-health-bar system and removed health packs. After each battle you didn&#x27;t have this scramble for a health pack just to get ready for the next confrontation, so the pacing was better than arena shooters imo.<p>Finally, Halo 2 didn&#x27;t need to be the global first on each bullet point to be innovative. But it was probably the first game to have all these in one package. There was a lot of UX polish in setting this standard which you can tell because most games don&#x27;t reach it even today.</div><br/><div id="40078502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40078502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amatecha</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40077985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40079200">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40078502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40078502">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t forget the post-game carnage report, which, while first present in Marathon, was refined and provided the best post-multiplayer-game stats of any game I&#x27;ve seen, even years later.</div><br/><div id="40079174" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40079174" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CYR1X</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40078502">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40079200">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40079174">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40079174">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The telemetry bungie used to popular stats on their website is better than pretty much any modern game today outside of like CS2.

Toys that parents buy for their children with the expectation that they can be mostly left to their own devices with them. The ESRB&#x2F;PEGI&#x2F;etc. ratings system was put in place so that parents would be able to trust that they know what&#x27;s in the toy without having to sit over the kids&#x27; shoulders every single minute they are playing. In a sense it&#x27;s not unlike Mattel spending a lot of energy making sure their dolls and action figures don&#x27;t pose any choking hazards.<p>Allowing modding breaks that system, and by extension the accompanying trust. This is a <i>big deal</i> for a toy manufacturer. It&#x27;s also why Hot Coffee was such a mess despite the content not being normally accessible. Parents don&#x27;t want to have to care about technicalities.<p>People like to think of this situation as a &quot;think of the children&quot;-type of hand-wringing, but it&#x27;s actually more of a &quot;think of the parents&quot;, who happen to be the ones with money.<p>Again, not discounting the greed and DRM aspects of this, and it definitely sucks pretty hard for adult users of the systems, but it&#x27;s far from all there is to it.</div><br/><div id="40077039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40077039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bri3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40076822">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40077075">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40077039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40077039">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve never heard of a parent being concerned about console mods, of all things, and I (as a parent) don&#x27;t really buy this angle.

Presumably if publishers were actually pressuring Microsoft to make a child-safe device, they&#x27;d have come up with a more advanced protection mechanism than that.<p>Modifiability&#x2F;vulnerability would not affect my game console buying decision as a parent at all, provided the console had some form of cursory parental controls. I&#x27;d probably choose a console that didn&#x27;t have such a simple bypass as the original Xbox, placed head to head with another console, but if my kid has to go online (!), learn about exploit development, and run some advanced tool to bypass parental controls, that&#x27;s a valuable learning experience, and they were already on the Internet somehow, a much more dangerous place than an M-rated game anyway.<p>DRM and cheating are the drivers for game console secure boot.

I think the remark about the SSD was unintentionally misleading -- perhaps he did mean the combo of 80pin + SSD though.<p>It does not require an overclocked CPU (he states that the CPU was not the bottleneck), and the increased RAM is only required if you want resolutions of 720p or higher.<p>I relayed the feedback though, he might update the blog post to make these points more explicit.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40077148" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40077148" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ericson2314</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40079465">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40078337">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40077148">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40077148">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think using the same motherboard counts for something</div><br/></div></div><div id="40078337" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40078337" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xen2xen1</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40077148">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40083444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40078337">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40078337">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Getting the most out of existing hardware is a pursuit in itself.

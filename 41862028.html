It&#x27;s a bit trickier to change the spoofed ID as I assume it&#x27;s buried deep in the game install somewhere obscure, but still possible. It&#x27;s actually a very popular game in northern Africa, the former Baltic states and surrounding areas as well as north and west Asia: without these players the server would be a ghost town.<p>Anyway, our approach is twofold carrot and stick style: Steam players get near instant reloads and immunity to some of the more &quot;enthusiastic&quot; automodding&#x2F;kick features: so for the price of a handful of VPN keys you can get a legitimate, allowed advantage over most of the server population as well as reserved username and &quot;VIP&quot; tag, plus you now own the game. Seems a great way to do it, as it&#x27;s available to anyone instantly for that one time fee (which goes direct to the game dev), or for free by playing at least 1 game a week for 5 weeks, then contacting the mod team on social media.<p>The other side to that (the stick), is that rather than simply kick&#x2F;ban the player we usually take some time to have fun annoying them, to show them they&#x27;re really not welcome, and make them actively not want to come back.<p>Disarming them then giving F tier weapons, a few random teleports out of bounds or stuck in the floor, repeat amx_rocket to turn them into a firework, amx_drug to max out FOV and add &quot;drunk&quot; effect, and ofc a bit of teasing about what a lowskill looser you must be to have fun while AI plays the game for you.<p>There&#x27;s also &quot;illegal&quot; amx plugins and commands, which are generally frowned upon and extremely abusable, but quite useful in these situations. My favorite (which most of the &quot;illegal plugins&quot; are based around) is amx_exec which essentially gives admins direct access to any client&#x27;s in-game console, to run any command or set any setting!<p>It&#x27;s actually kind of terrifying that exists. For example this set of commands sets network baudrate to 1000 (that&#x27;ll be fun for the cheater until they notice), changes name, wipes all keybinds, then binds the default chat key to close the game, while setting max FPS low enough to be bothersome without being obvious! There are pre-built macros that do far worse to your settings too: although easily fixable by deleting to restore defaults, would be very frustrating if you hadn&#x27;t backed up your config files.<p>amx_exec cheatername &quot;rate 1000&quot;

Many servers charge for VIP advantages, to the tune of up to $20&#x2F;month! At first I thought this pretty shocking, until I found out that there&#x27;s some kinda shady clique where to be listed in a reasonable spot on 3rd party server browsers, a hefty fee is required, and a significant proportion of this income gets spent on &quot;boosts&quot;.<p>When our server owner stopped paying for &quot;boost&quot; for two months, mean player count dropped from 14&#x2F;32 to 3&#x2F;32, and max players from a regular 28&#x2F;32 on weekends, to 12&#x2F;32 on a Friday night if lucky. The player count rocketed as soon as the owner started paying again... but the crazy thing is it&#x27;s $180&#x2F;month!<p>Before getting involved with moderating, I thought running a fun, deathmatch, well moderated, low ping, high performance server dedicated to remakes&#x2F;remixes of the 2nd most popular map in the game would be enough to be popular&#x2F;busy. But no, apparently you have to pay extortionate fees to incumbent gatekeepers, if you want your server to be visible to the majority of the playerbase!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41863123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41863123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghxst</span><span>|</span><a href="#41862807">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41867262">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41862963">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41863123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41863123">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This still leaves you wide open to cheaters using mobile data tethering and proxies.

The CPU in a gaming rig might not have as many cores as your average server CPU, but it&#x27;s almost certainly going to have higher single-core perf.<p>And part of the reason for that, is that games really <i>do</i> try to use your whole CPU (and GPU), with AAA studios especially being factories for constant innovation in new ways to make even the minimum requirements just to run a game&#x27;s physics, higher and higher every year.<p>And if the server <i>can&#x27;t</i> do &quot;faster than realtime&quot; analysis of the streams of inputs of the players, then by queuing theory, it&#x27;ll inevitably get infinitely backlogged — the server will keep receiving new analysis work to do every timestep, and will fall further and further behind, never catching up until new work stops being generated — i.e. until the match is over. And then it&#x27;ll have to probably sit there for five more minutes thinking really hard before spitting out a &quot;hey, wait just a minute...&quot; about any given match.<p>Which is fine <i>if</i> there&#x27;s a big central lobby server that the game is forced to connect to, and your goal is to ensure that some central statistic that that central server relies upon (e.g. match-rank ELO) gets calculated correctly, such that cheaters are prevented from climbing the leaderboards &#x2F; winning their way into high-ranked play. (And that&#x27;s exactly the situation the big eSports games companies are in.)<p>But in the context of older games that use arbitrary hosted servers and random-pairing (or manual lobby-based match selection) — or in modern, but &quot;dead&quot;, games, that only persist due to being modded to accept private servers — this &quot;after-the-fact&quot; punishment is useless, as most servers have no incentive to do this analysis, especially when cheaters can just hop around between servers. So there&#x27;s nothing preventing people from being <i>matched with cheaters</i>, sometimes over and over again, if the cheaters can just tell their clients to roll up with a new key+IP for every match.<p>...and that&#x27;s assuming there even <i>are</i> servers. You can forget about any of this working in a p2p context.

I was just pointing out a solution to a problem the GP proposed as intractable when trying to analyze player input data streams for cheating. The points you made are valid as far as the evolution of this cat and mouse game is progressing (probably still closer to the end end of can then do for now).<p>That being said, the vast majority of cheats are not that sophisticated. &quot;Simple&quot; analysis of player input should still be used to make low effort cheats less or ineffective. Especially if used to compare consistency of mechanical play by a player. I doubt most cheaters want to just turn on a full bot that plays by itself for the whole game. You can build a model of play customized for an individual player to look for changes in mechanical skill during critical plays. Then even if that was incorporated into the cheat client so that its &#x27;actions&#x27; can&#x27;t be definitevly detected against the players baseline, it would at least be limited to cheating as that player always playing like it&#x27;s their best day. Either that or the cheater would have to go fully hands off for that account which I imagine is not as appealing for most cheaters.<p>Input analysis, even much simpleler approaches, can still be a valuable tool to make cheating more difficult and less opportunistic. The goal would be to raise the barrier of entry to cheating without immediately getting banned beyond downloading and running a client. If people who consider cheating in a game have to: order, wait for, and setup additional hardware then aquire models trained for the latest version of the game that are also trained on pro play in a way that lets the cheating be humanly plausible to remain undetected; it will reduce the total number of people who cheat in that title. Will needing to aquire additional hardware stop all cheating? No, I had a friend as a kid that owned a GameShark that I used and ended up corrupting the save on one of my Pokemon games. But if all of that is what is required to be able to successfully and consistently cheat, it will raise both the cost of development of cheats as well as their price to cheaters.<p>For top level professional play, in person tournaments on managed setups will remain the gold standard for the forseeable future (and besides they are attractive as events for their own sake). And for the rest of us, we will continue to be trapped in the labyrinth with both the cat and the mice.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41866506" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41866506" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">viraptor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41862807">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41864518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41865005">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41865108">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41866506">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41866506">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The CPU being overwhelmed with physics sounds sus to me.

For example, imagine a cheat that gives the player additional info about where enemies are and their state (ie: health).

How are you going to detect that, and differentiate it from players who simply have a great sense of map awareness and a good ability to keep track of enemies and when to punish them?<p>Anything that makes assumptions about player&#x27;s skills runs into problems too. For any online PvP game, the skill ceiling will rise with time. What once may have been considered improbable may soon become what&#x27;s consistent for the top 1% or even 0.1% of the playerbase given a few years.<p>As well, it can run into problems as rebalancing occurs and new abilities are released.</div><br/><div id="41863342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41863342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oneplane</span><span>|</span><a href="#41862659">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41863142">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41863156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41863342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41863342">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even the base example would make that specific scenario trivial: an account that is new has no business &quot;being better&quot; than everyone else.<p>The only group you&#x27;d punish with that is skilled players that lose their account (and create a new one), but if you use a moving skill window they can grow back into their plausibility pretty quickly, and it&#x27;s a small cost compared to everything else. And you could even mitigate that by making things like the first 10 matches require a different plausibility score than the matches after that.<p>And with different I don&#x27;t mean &quot;no scoring at all&quot; or something like that. But a cheater tends to not cheat &quot;a little bit&quot;. You might have togglers, but that sticks out like a sore thumb (people don&#x27;t suddenly lose or gain skill like that). And even if that fails (lots of &quot;cheating a little bit&quot; for example), you&#x27;ve still managed to boot out the obvious persistent cheating.<p>And that&#x27;s just with 1 example and 1 scenario.

Even then someone could cheat, but you&#x27;re so far outside of the realm of general cheating, I wonder if that&#x27;s worth including in a system that&#x27;s mostly beneficial inside the mass market gaming players.<p>Either way, this sort of detection is usually done in the financial and retail world, and results in highly acceptable rates and results.

For example, some server operators using their player bases residential IP addresses to sign up to gambling websites so they got kickbacks. Others simply tried to hijack Steam accounts or sell rare Steam virtual items on the Steam marketplace to themselves.<p>After Valve patched the above exploit, some smaller bugs popped up in the following weeks and 2 months later in October, Valve completely binned the VGUI browser in CSGO.

Admins need to provide a personal cost deterrent for problem users, and randomly hang the game for people using code mods.<p>Let the ban hammer fall =3</div><br/><div id="41864808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41864808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johnisgood</span><span>|</span><a href="#41863054">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41864808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41864808">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unless I misunderstood, I do not see how this would actually work in practice considering the client can be modified and I can send whatever I want to the server, i.e. spoofing.</div><br/><div id="41865414" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41865414" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Joel_Mckay</span><span>|</span><a href="#41863054">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41864808">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41865414">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41865414">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even the Webgl signature check is resilient, and is the new tracking cookie on many sites like YT etc.  It is a robust unique property of a specific system, and GPU.

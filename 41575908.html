There was another case where a McKinsey consultant (IIT+IIM postgrad) who joined the firm and commited suicide (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consultancy.in&#x2F;news&#x2F;4168&#x2F;young-mckinsey-consultant-commits-suicide-due-to-work-pressure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consultancy.in&#x2F;news&#x2F;4168&#x2F;young-mckinsey-consulta...</a>).<p>The story starts way back. In general the schooling syllabus in India is very broad and deep (I can say this now since I live outside India). Then due to the large population - around 30 million students complete school every year. After that there are not many good universities (you may have heard of IITs or NITs), only around 100-200K get into good unis. The competetion to get in is therefore intense. Preparation for these &quot;entrance exams&quot; can start at age 15 (or even earlier).<p>If someone makes it somehow, graduation, postgrad and MBA is another similar struggle. Now you think you surely made it. The last 7-8 years of intense work and hardship are over, this is doubly true if the person is not from a well off family in India (which is very common). Preparation schools, hostels, being away from family etc. has its mental costs.<p>Then you land a job and it hits you, as a new joiner in the hugely competitive Indian job market you are treated like sh* and all this while you thought &quot;you made it&quot; but the real struggle has just started. Long working hours, immense pressure and then the thought that all the hardwork you did in the past can come crashing down with one bad review. Combine that with the real stuggles of life as you move to a new city, manage finances, support family back home etc. it creates a huge amount of pressure. Some unfortunately are not able to handle it, they are in a position they feel that all was futile and no one can understand their situation.</div><br/><div id="41577433" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41577433" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pas</span><span>|</span><a href="#41577157">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577295">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41577433">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41577433">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; no one can understand their situation.<p>so there&#x27;s no bonding at work? is it because, those who do understand and could empthatize are incentivized to instead show no mercy and try to push out the newcomers? how come managers are not &quot;entourage building&quot;?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41577295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41577295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loa_in_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41577157">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577433">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577164">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41577295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41577295">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really can&#x27;t fault people for coming to a conclusion that it&#x27;s futile if they don&#x27;t work for something except work.

Left soon after qualifying. Some weeks I clocked in over 50 hours but never usually much more. Never had to do an all-nighter though I knew loads of people who did. Part of the reason I had a good experience was that I was lucky enough to work with an excellent manager who was well organised and knew how to audit without wasting time on spurious nonsense. I had to sacrifice a few Easter bank holidays in busy season but we got back the time in lieu. Outside of busy season was fairly quiet - Thursday afternoon pub lunches etc.<p>Some people did far more hours than me but I think it was mostly self imposed. A small minority of the partners were twats but the vast majority were mindful of people’s well-being. Friday evening drinks in corney and barrow were sacred and on days I didnt want to work longer I just got up and left to the disbelief of the audit room - they got over it though!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41577010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41577010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thefz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41577164">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41577010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41577010">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every junior in consulting companies that I spoke to has been explicit in saying that these companies put an excessive amount of work on new hires to gate those that don&#x27;t want to grind out - and artificial effort barrage.<p>Life gets easier once they get past this stage.<p>Having had abysmal managers in my past, I always ask - where was in this case the manager&#x27;s managers, and why has his shitty behavior not been reported in skip level?</div><br/><div id="41577256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41577256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjc50</span><span>|</span><a href="#41577010">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577302">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41577256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41577256">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What would reporting it to the skip level achieve?

People have a tendency to accept abuse when they think it&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot;. For example, if your parents fought and argued all the time it&#x27;s natural to think that&#x27;s normal and find yourself in a similar, toxic relationship and never question it. We keep getting fed this idea that you need to break your back (&quot;grind&quot;) to succeed, that working all day and all night is a good thing etc. So people will push themselves much further than they otherwise would.<p>The people who cared for this person told her to stop, but she kept going because she believed (and this is a direct quote from the still grieving parent) that &quot;becoming a chartered accountant involves years of toil, hardship and sacrifice&quot;. But who is telling these lies? The media, who fetishise this stuff, and the people who &quot;made it&quot; who, by the way, inherited their wealth, were a nepotism hire or are just more genetically gifted and&#x2F;or lucky than you. Everyone will tell you their job is hard, they struggle and they deserve what they have, yet their backs are miraculously intact.<p>Getting to the position I&#x27;m at has involved years of work and study, but hardship and toil? You&#x27;ve got to be kidding. I enjoy what I do. It&#x27;s not a hardship. I read books and write programs for fun. I would never tell anyone that to succeed in this field they need to lose sleep and sacrifice their health and relationships. That would be abusive.

EY spent a fair amount to plan the restructuring and took on a fair amount of debt to pair for it (and of course it did this before bothering to make sure the stakeholders would actually go through with the plan)...<p>Clients began to wonder why they should trust EY with their restructuring&#x2F;business planning&#x2F;etc if EY couldn&#x27;t even handle its own. This resulted in a pretty significant outflow of clients in the consulting and tax groups.<p>The debt service and loss of revenue led to several rounds of layoffs (in the U.S., and overseas), frozen promotions, etc. PwC and Deloitte were the major benefactors, but a lot of the Next 20 firms also scooped up former EY employees and clients.

But once when getting back to the office 5 minutes after realizing he had forgotten something important at his desk, the whole thing was empty. He realized all his subordinates would just wait for him to go in order to not be seen as lazy workers. It was all about pretending as some might have been playing solitaire while waiting, who knows.<p>He had to implement a mandatory &quot;leave before I do&quot; rule to fight against this toxic culture.<p>Years later I realized one coworker in my mostly swiss team was doing the same when I went back to my desk also for a forgotten item less than 5 minutes after my departure. One of my coworker was always still at his desk when I was heading home but when I went back, he was already gone. Out of curiosity I did it a few times and could only confirm. I even rammed into him in the corridor when I turned back literally 2 minutes later. That employee was french too.<p>----<p>Different culture, but similar. There are lots of indians and people of indian origin in my company. Most are obviously living in India and some living in UK and the USA. It seems to me that those living in India are spending a lot of time at work. Since I am on the euro timezone, they are obviously online when I am starting my day, but they are also always online a long time after I have shutdown my computer according to their activity on our enterprise chat app.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of their local laws but this cannot be healthy in the long term.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41576609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41576609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rrr_oh_man</span><span>|</span><a href="#41576500">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41576554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41576977">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41576609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41576609">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;What should we do if they&#x27;re here voluntarily?&quot; — EY + Deloitte Austria</div><br/><div id="41576680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41576680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wiz21c</span><span>|</span><a href="#41576500">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41576609">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41577271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41576680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41576680">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They are not there voluntarily.

However, to get that: we will push you to your limits. That implies: you may burn out (and needs psychological assistance for years), you may be so tired that you develop illness, you will be treated like inferior humans (although we won&#x27;t tell you), we won&#x27;t be responsible, you will work insane hours, we won&#x27;t tolerate complains and you&#x27;ll be fired at will&quot;...

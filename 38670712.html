I had secured a job, but unexpectedly, the company ran out of funds within six months.<p>The first week after my termination, I was just lost in space and time, freaking out. Over the next two weeks, I applied to every possible software engineering job, sending at least a thousand emails. I spent all days long on the phone, switching ears when one became sore from holding the phone.<p>It took me only two weeks to find a new gig. In the end, I allowed myself a week to decompress and then joined the new company, four weeks after losing my previous position. The stress was intense. My bank account hovered between $3k-$6k, and the stakes were high. If I didn&#x27;t secure a job soon, my family and I faced the real possibility of going under the bridge.<p>My advice to those in similar situations is this: don&#x27;t let despair dominate your thoughts. Instead, think about your family, or imagine you have a child, or will have in the future, and now it&#x27;s your time to prove you can do it.<p>I believe this mindset is crucial. IMO, intensive preparation for leetcode is less important in desperate times. It&#x27;s better to continuously apply to jobs. Leetcode is more suitable when you&#x27;re already employed and can afford to spend time on it, ideally over a span of six months to a year, to thoroughly tackle those 300 popular questions.</div><br/><div id="38671277" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38671277" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dinobones</span><span>|</span><a href="#38671201">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38671277">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38671277">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">2014 was basically peak ZIRP and startup era.

Just ask them to have a quick chat, and have specific questions about your job hunt ready - ask them to share their approach to a job search, share what you&#x27;ve done, and ask if they have any advice for improvement. If the chat goes well, you can ask if it&#x27;s alright if you reach out again. You don&#x27;t necessarily need a full &quot;mentor&quot;, just some guidance.<p>Re: Referrals - This is not strictly about typical &quot;referrals&quot;, but if you can have a chat with a recruiter, you often can similarly cut through initial screens &#x2F; red tape.<p>I have had a ton of luck reaching out directly to in-house recruiters for roles I&#x27;m interested in on LinkedIn. They&#x27;re often constantly on LinkedIn, frequently doing outbound, and IME they&#x27;re often happy that someone reached out - and this can be more effective than spending an hour hand-crafting a cover letter. Keep the message to a couple sentences, share why you&#x27;re interested in the company, and again, ask to have a quick chat.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38670793" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38670793" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kirubakaran</span><span>|</span><a href="#38671316">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38671174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38670793">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38670793">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Whenever you need just one of something (job, relationship etc), it&#x27;s going to look hopeless, right up to the moment that you get that one thing, and then you&#x27;d wonder why you ever worried.<p>You have the experience.

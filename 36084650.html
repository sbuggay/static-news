The real mistake was done 50 years ago. Now there are two bad choices, both with potential unacceptable outcomes, and only hind-sight will prove one wrong or right.<p>In some respects, a return to the wild is a hail-mary. Is 5 years free better than another 50 of confinement?<p>I&#x27;m inclined to agree that it&#x27;s worth trying  regardless if the outcome. While fully understanding that the outcome can turn sour, there are valuable lessons to be learned - both in re-introduction techniques, and in the moral long-term aspects of capturing and using them for entertainment. Like Keiko, if this helps solidify the reasons not to capture again, then at least some good comes of it.</div><br/><div id="36092326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36092326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">geuis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36092262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36092299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36092326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36092326">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not sure if I agree because you have good points, but I&#x27;m also hesitant.<p>If you were captured by aliens as a kid and then later &quot;trained&quot; on how to act human at 57, how would you judge your ability to remotely survive in your native society?<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s way too late to try a 100% repatriation idea. Based on the observed behavior of other releases whales, she&#x27;s going to require continuous human interaction and care until her death.<p>Let&#x27;s maybe move her from Miami, but setup a scenario where she comes back to home base on her own. Let her interact with her old family pod if she wants, but still have people around when she comes back to port for food or interaction.<p>She got stolen from her family nearly 60 years ago, the least we can do now is to provide a bridge to make her comfortable.<p>I don&#x27;t like how the article makes it seem like an all or nothing scenario.<p>But I barely know anything about the topic, so beware of the giant grains of salt on the road.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36092299" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36092299" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">geuis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36092262">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36092321">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36092299">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36092299">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Man I&#x27;m mixed on this. I&#x27;m very happy that these creatures aren&#x27;t being stolen from the ocean anymore for human entertainment.<p>But for an old lady like this, the odds of her re-adapting to a wild state are basically nil. Imagine being abducted by aliens at a youngish age and later, without ever being able to meaningfully communicate with your captors, and many decades later you&#x27;re being moved to a distantly remembered place and set free. Hell, a popular sci-fi setting in movies and books involves a person living in similar circumstances and being sent back home decades later.<p>At least in this scenario the idea is to slowly re-introduce her and get her reacquainted with the area.<p>Anyway, without knowing more details than the article provides, I kind of am siding with the alternate idea of letting her live out her days with those dolphins she&#x27;s lived with forever, plus her known human assistants.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not as fulfilling as Free Willy (who died soon after release), but at least she would be in familiar company and have more space to move around in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36092321" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36092321" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">remarkEon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36092299">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36085092">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36092321">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36092321">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;The whale believed to be Toki’s mother is the matriarch of L-pod, one of three clans that make up the so-called southern resident killer whales, a genetically and socially distinct population that frequents the Salish Sea between Washington and British Columbia.

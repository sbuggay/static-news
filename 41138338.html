There are subjective things we&#x27;ll never able to compare, like whether your experience of red and green is the same as mine or swapped. Then there are other things like face blindness that have testable effects in the real world. When one person says they see 80% clear mental pictures and another person says 10%, how can we be so sure they aren&#x27;t just describing the same experience differently? I have no idea how I could accurately report my experience of the apple test. I could say I see it clearly or not at all depending on what you mean by seeing.<p>EDIT: It also reminds me of the &quot;inner monologue&quot;. I&#x27;m skeptical when people confidently claim they have no inner monologue, as if it&#x27;s as easy to verify as being right-handed or left-handed.

It&#x27;s not like a screen but more like wearing augmented reality glasses with very low brightness&#x2F;opacity to the point where the images have only 1% solidity.  Also, the detail level of the images is low, similar to an impressionist painting.  However, properties of color, size, and 3D spatial location and orientation are all well-defined, so for example I can imagine a (very low opacity, very rough, impressionist style) picture of Mario or Luigi standing upon this line of text on my screen and being 1 inch tall.  It&#x27;s my understanding that this level of capability is higher than average, but less than talented artists like painters or sculptors.  Despite not being good enough for a career in art, this mildly better than average ability level, combined with being able to code, allowed me to be quite successful as an augmented reality prototyper in the first half of my career.<p>It looks roughly like the detail level of picture &quot;C&quot; in this picture:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.siggraph.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;2014-Technical-Papers-Maimone_Pinlight-Displays-Wide-Field-of-View-Augmented-Reality-Eyeglasses.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.siggraph.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;2014...</a>

Many mistakenly assume that their own subjective experience is universal or &quot;correct,&quot; failing to recognize the vast diversity of internal processes across different people.<p>Recognizing this diversity is crucial.

All of this seems to happen during the span of 60 seconds max (judging from my heartbeats), but this has categorically been debunked when my wife once told me I was actually snoring for a couple of minutes.</div><br/><div id="41145650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41145650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bemmu</span><span>|</span><a href="#41143024">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41143585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41145754">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41145650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41145650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The melody thing I assume I have not suddenly become a master composer, rather the part of my mind capable of judging whether the music is any good has become impaired.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41145754" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41145754" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CTDOCodebases</span><span>|</span><a href="#41143024">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41143378">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41143585">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41145403">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41145754">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41145754">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t consume chemicals but do meditate.<p>As I drift off to sleep sometimes it&#x27;s fun to shift the inner eye to observe the mind and watch images float across my &quot;viewport&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41145403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41145403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kolinko</span><span>|</span><a href="#41143024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41143378">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41144907">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41145403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41145403">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are some surprisingly objective tests for aphantasia - fmri shows it pretty clearly, but also imagining bright things causes iris to change in normal people but not in people with aphantasia.<p>You could say that aphants just may not be trying enough - there are tests for that as well.

How we perceive those colors is exclusively a product of our brain using input filtering from our eyes and then converting this into signals that we then perceive. But there&#x27;s no reason to think that this processing and filtering eventually results in the exact same perceived color for every person. My red, blue, and purple could all be perceived simply differently than yours - even though every physical law interacting with what we perceive as color would behave identically.<p>And the even more interesting thing is that this nuance of reality extends to everything. The world as we perceive is only after extensive processing and filtering by our brain, driven by millennia of evolution. And it&#x27;s very safe to say that our perception of the world has changed over those millennia and will continue to change in the future.

Though - presumably if you had good spatial perception (but no visual memory) - you could do it simply by remembering precisely what your spatial relationship to your origin was, without reference to anything visual - it’s the lack of <i>either</i> which results in me getting lost <i>instantly</i>.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41144808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41144808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wrs</span><span>|</span><a href="#41142132">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41142593">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41144943">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41142993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41144808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41144808">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In order to navigate after I put down the map, I have learned I have to literally translate it into words.

Like all players when I was weaker I had no board visualization, and would have difficulty visualizing even simple variations. And then at some point I began to be able to see the board easily. The counter-intuitive thing is that there was no progress, it was like a stair-step. At some point in my &#x27;career&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t see the board at all, then suddenly I could. I think it has something to do with trained pattern recognition, because now when doing things like tactics problems I can generally look at the position for a few seconds and then close my eyes and get to solving it in my head. But I can&#x27;t do this in weird positions where there&#x27;s a bunch of pieces in random locations. So my visualization is clearly impacted by some association with familiar patterns.<p>I also think my experience is the rule based on coaching I&#x27;ve done with players of all ages and skill levels. I suspect most strong players aren&#x27;t familiar with this, because they started playing as children. Nakamura, for instance, hit national master level at 10 years old. I don&#x27;t trust his recollection of introspective astract&#x2F;perceptual detail, as a 6 year old, to be particularly accurate.

They couldn&#x27;t believe I was serious. I couldn&#x27;t believe they were serious... For a while at least.<p>My mind works on rules, not imagery. If I am asked to &quot;not think of an elephant in a room&quot;, I (of course) immediately think of an elephant in a room, but it&#x27;s not a visual picture - it&#x27;s relationships between room and elephant (does it touch the walls, the space around it, does it press the light-switch on, can the door open if it opens inwards, ...) It&#x27;s the <i>concept</i> of an elephant in a room. There&#x27;s no visual.<p>Similarly, I don&#x27;t know my right from my left - instead I have a rule in my head that I run through virtually instantaneously &quot;I write with my right&quot;. That then distinguishes for me which is which. If someone gives me directions &quot;first right, second left, right by the pub and next right&quot; I run through that rule for the first instance, and then I have the concept of &quot;not-right&quot; for the &quot;second left&quot; bit. It gets &quot;cached&quot; for a while, and then drops out.<p>So where&#x27;s the advantage ? I can consciously build these rules up into complicated (well, more complicated than people expect) structures of relationships and &quot;work them&quot;.

In order to visualize something, I give constraints to my imagination.<p>If I decide to visualize a photo-realistic drink, the drink will have a color. If I don&#x27;t constrain the color either directly (&quot;yellow&quot;) or indirectly (&quot;citrus drink&quot;), my imagination will pick a color by default because it has to fill in the scene given by the constraints (&quot;photo-realistic&quot;).

It&#x27;s harder to describe what I experience then, but &quot;feeling&quot; a graph of concepts would be somewhat close. It&#x27;s harder to conceptualize a purely non-abstract thing for me because my imagination will try to picture it given the chance, it works better as part of a reasoning process or on abstract things.<p>&gt; A follow up to that, if most people can see imagery like this, why on earth do people spend so much time with their nose in a phone?

Being uninspired applies equally to imagination and drawing. There&#x27;s also only so many times you can draw or imagine a particular topic in a row before you get bored of it.<p>It&#x27;s also a question of producing vs consuming. I can listen to music in my head with little effort, but I can hear music with my headphones with no effort.

(Much of my thinking is already roughly abstract-lingual, so reading feels of-a-piece. I would characterize myself as having a running interior narrative, but this isn&#x27;t a voice I &quot;hear&quot; as I gather it is for some.)<p>I generally prefer reading to listening since it&#x27;s easier to back up and re-read if my attention has wandered.<p>I can have trouble staying ~oriented when there are lots of characters because I have no strong sense of what they look or sound like. (TBH I think this is an asset when it comes to adaptations. I may notice plot divergences, but I&#x27;m rarely bothered by the specifics of a place or character.)<p>A fair fraction of the enjoyment I get out of reading is about wordplay and language aesthetics, and much of the rest is about ~ideas and personalities.<p>Reading tends to drive a lot of synthesis&#x2F;connection between divergent concepts for me. Some of my most intellectually-fertile (generative) time centers around reading.<p>I generally can&#x27;t count on any kind of eidetic memory (unlike those I know who can, say, picture a page or replay a conversation to extract information from it). Instead, I generally lean more on deep conceptual synthesis. I am much more likely to retain some picky detail when it&#x27;s integrated into my broader understanding than if it&#x27;s effectively an arbitrary fact. I am the person who would rather take an essay exam centered on understanding than a picky multiple choice that hinges on arbitrary details like dates.<p>Likewise, I don&#x27;t really vibe with arch&#x2F;infra&#x2F;service maps as much as narrative documentation.

It&#x27;s the same as my imagination when reading. Meaning, I am aware of the plot, I can &quot;feel&quot; the place setting, recognize the actors involved, and sometimes even feel&#x2F;understand the internal motivations of other actors in my dreams. It&#x27;s hard to describe what I mean by &quot;feeling,&quot; but maybe it is similar to how you &quot;feel&quot; your emotions. None of this is visual, even in my dreams. I rarely remember my dreams.<p>Recalling memories: As the article mentions, I have very weak autobiographical and episodic memories, to the point where my wife and friends are often surprised at how much more clearly they remember the events of my own life. I really do not recall, with any clarity, any events more than 10 years old. At the same time, my memory of &quot;causal facts&quot; is very strong. Meaning I have the ability to remember why things happened basically forever. For example, when taking calculus, I had a very hard time memorizing trigonometric identities, but if I was taught the origin, the &quot;why&quot; I would remember how recreate the identity on the fly for test. Plotlines are similar. I remember the motivation of the characters, the motivating details of the plotline itself, and then subsequent detail is attached to those logical threads of memory. Recall seems very tied to useful purpose. Meaning, I can&#x27;t just remember something in detail at request. But if I take 15-30 minutes to start working on something, I am flooded with memories regarding that subject. And of course, none of these memories have a visual component. It&#x27;s all more of an abstract collection of &quot;stuff&quot; that has a real mental substance and mass, for lack of better words, but not imagery.<p>Recalling visual media: Similar to above. The media is decomposed into chains of cause&#x2F;effect. Again, hard to describe. I cannot &quot;replay&quot; a movie in any meaningful sense, but if we sit down to watch a movie I&#x27;ve already seen, I will immediately remember basically the entire plotline within a few minutes. I don&#x27;t really enjoy rewatching movies, or even replaying video games unless there is something novel (watching with someone new&#x2F;extra content). Reading books is different. I regularly reread books I enjoyed, maybe because there is a much higher amount of content from a logical plotline&#x2F;story point of view.<p>Imagination: I &quot;feel&quot; things? Again, mostly centered around arranging lines of causal detail. When I was younger I used to put myself to sleep by making up stories in my head. This is very easy for me, but it&#x27;s like an audio book (without visualization). This happens, then this happens. Alice says this, and that made Bob believe that, implying feelings. Miscommunication! Etc. Outside of imaginary storytelling I spent most of my time as a kid imagining what I could do&#x2F;build, and this is the main activity of my adult imagination: imagining things I could make, things I could do with my family, etc.<p>Maybe another example, I&#x27;m not face-blind. I recognize faces, even in my imagination, but I don&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; them in any literal fashion. For example I can imagine, now, what Viggo M. cast as Aragorn looks like, through the different emotional exclusions of the character, but I &quot;feel&quot; it. I don&#x27;t see his face visually. I&#x27;ve had the experience of reading a book, watching a movie adaptation, and disliking the casting choice because it didn&#x27;t match the &quot;picture&quot; in my head. Only there is no literal picture. The actors face &quot;feels&quot; wrong for the character. After seeing the actor I could tell you why their face was wrong for the role, but I could not tell you ahead-of-time what the character &quot;looks like&quot; in my imagination. I tend not to remember details of an author&#x27;s physical description of their characters. I can&#x27;t tell you, even now, if Aragorn has blue or brown eyes in the books. I think Viggo M. haa blue eyes, but that&#x27;s a fact I&#x27;m remembering, not a mental image I&#x27;m consulting.<p>Reading: not much to add I haven&#x27;t touched on already.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41139293" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41139293" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SuperNinKenDo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41139141">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41139170">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41142876">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41140712">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41139293">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41139293">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not the person you&#x27;re replying to, but I would call myself &quot;near aphantasic&quot; and the answer to all these is that they are almost entirely conceptual rather than visual.

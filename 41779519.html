Do you spend time thinking about making your own game engine? Then start making it. Be willing to change course later if it&#x27;s too hard, your time will not be wasted.<p>I got into gamedev by messing around with making my own engine, mostly focusing on low level graphics APIs, and that knowledge transferred well when I switched to a professional game engine. I knew about shaders and such and knew I was somewhat prepared to alter the engine I was using if needed.<p>Or, the other way, if you start making a game in an engine and you hate it, your efforts are not wasted. The truth is like 10 or 20 thousand lines of game logic can make a lot of games, and that&#x27;s really not much code to port to your own game engine compared to the rest of the engine. All the art and other assets can be ported too. Plus, if you know a professional game engine you can use it for tooling or get some good architecture ideas to use in your own engine.<p>So, just get moving with whatever excites you most and be willing to change course.</div><br/><div id="41783221" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41783221" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fr0styMatt88</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780797">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41781921">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41783221">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41783221">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This gets at something I’ve thought about a lot as a software dev.<p>Making a game engine is a very concrete task, in that you can map out the steps and many of them are well-defined.<p>On the other hand “make a good game” kinda isn’t.

I fully agree that if you want to make a game-engine then make one. It&#x27;s fun! On the other hand, if you want to make a game, use an existing engine.<p>Analogies: I want to write a novel so I&#x27;ll first build a typewriter. I want to film a movie so I&#x27;ll first build a camera and digital editing software. I want to cook food so I&#x27;ll first build a stove, pots, pans, and knives.<p>In all those other examples it hopefully clear, you just buy the tools you need and then make the thing the tools allow you to make. At this point, the same is true in games.<p>If you like making a game engine than make one. Just like if you like making knives or cameras then make them. But, making a knife is not cooking, making a camera is not making a movie, and making a game-engine is not making a game.<p>I also want to add, making a game-engine is easy compared to making a game. Why? Because all the things to you need are well known. You need a 2d renderer (UI), a 3d renderer (assuming you need 3d), image loaders, model loaders, sound players, music players, keyboard input, joypad input, entity systems. Etc. You build them and it seems like you&#x27;re making progress and if your goal is to make a game-engine, then you are making progress. But, if your goal is to make game, you&#x27;re mostly likely fooling yourself that you&#x27;re making progress. Again, back to the analogies, if you&#x27;re making a knife, you aren&#x27;t making progress on cooking, your making progress on making a knife.

Yes people bikeshed etc. but when you create your own engine you are _fiercely_ aware of _everything_ it can and can&#x27;t do. As part of this, it&#x27;s very easy to feel fully in command of your own toolset, and as such able to exhibit mastery over that toolset.<p>Granted, the scope of possibility when you start out building your own tool is narrow, but in some ways that acts as an easier onboarding to expertise instead of getting dumped into something as powerful as Unity&#x2F;Unreal&#x2F;Godot with little orientation and lots of edges you don&#x27;t know about. In using some super-general you have to carve out your own path through its features, which is cognitive load (and time!) you don&#x27;t need to worry about when you create your own.<p>For similar reasons I&#x27;m _also_ making my own engine. It&#x27;s 2D-only engine that uses lots of modern C# features to make for rapid programming of 2D games. For the game I&#x27;m making with it to start, I&#x27;m using literally every feature of the engine, which is something I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever be able to say for something more general purpose.<p>For anyone interested:

Most people aren&#x27;t willing to even investigate how easy it is to make “a game engine”, because the term “game engine” has been mythologized (due to Unity, Godot, etc.) into being this thing that&#x27;s for all practical purposes impossible for the average programmer to build.<p>“As a solo developer, either you work on building an engine, <i>or</i> you work on building a game, but if you&#x27;re going to do the former, then you&#x27;ll never complete the latter,” they say (in this very comments section, even). Well, sure… if by “game engine” you mean “general-purpose super-generic game engine,” and not “the smallest set of things absolutely necessary to transmute the idea I have in my head into playable form on this supercomputer I&#x27;m sitting in front of.”<p>I don&#x27;t really get it—I started programming games by learning Game Maker in the early 00s. By the time I was ready to move onto something more like “<i>real</i> game development” (C#&#x2F;XNA), I was more than eager to structure things more according to how I wanted for whatever given project I was working on, rather than trying to cram my ideas into a somebody-else&#x27;s-engine-shaped hole.<p>But the freely-downloadable general-purpose game engines available these days, with their innumerable layers of wholly-unnecessary overly-generalized one-size-fits-all abstractions have gotten most people who use them to never even <i>consider</i> even <i>imagining</i> doing things in any way other than the way they&#x27;re now used to doing them, using their tool of choice. They&#x27;re more than happy to settle with thinking about game design purely in terms of whatever high-level primitives are exposed by their preferred engine, rather than even <i>consider</i> even <i>imagining</i> what it would be like to have complete control over how their game logic is organized and executed.<p>Why simply define structs and make arrays of struct instances and iterate over them, when you could make a byzantine web of Nodes&#x2F;GameObjects in the engine-provided scene graph? I guess that&#x27;s how indie “game developers” these days have been trained to think.<p>And it&#x27;s crazy because compared to only a couple short decades ago, there&#x27;s more information and resources available out there on the Web for free, that anyone can read and use to make building something “from scratch” (where “from scratch” means “using open-source libraries to do the parts you don&#x27;t want to learn more about for the time being, such as rendering”) easier than it ever has been before! You can use something like SDL or Raylib to “sketch out” a gameplay prototype in <i>shockingly</i> few lines of code, then refactor everything so that all library calls are wrapped in function calls more suited to your use case, and then, later, if you want, you can <i>replace</i> those library calls with your own code!<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to do <i>at all</i>, but I think there&#x27;s just some level of comfort people take in having a GUI editor for their “game engine” that they can open a blank project in and start clicking around to make things happen on the screen, compared to staring at a blank source code file and figuring out where to go from there.<p>The ever-decreasing baseline level of curiosity and hacker-thinking in younger programmers continues to both baffle and depress me.</div><br/><div id="41782419" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41782419" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MattRix</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41781068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41781272">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41782419">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41782419">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People like designing and making games, so they design and make games… Making the engine (or underlying framework, whatever) is just not necessary for that goal.<p>There are relatively few game designs (especially with indie scope!) where a custom engine is truly necessary.<p>For the tinker&#x2F;hacker types, there are plenty of things to do at a “lower level” within the engine itself (note: I don’t necessarily mean modifying the source code).

If you weren&#x27;t relying on someone else&#x27;s underlying game engine substrate to build your game upon, then you would never encounter something like this. It would be entirely upon you to restructure your <i>own</i> underlying game engine substrate that <i>you&#x27;ve built</i> in order to build your game upon. You would <i>know</i> what each part of the machinery is doing, because you built it—you wouldn&#x27;t have to guess and check and dive deep into documentation and forum threads and Discord channels just to try to figure out the optimal way to beat the engine into submission to do the thing you&#x27;re trying to make it do.<p>Have you seen the Raylib examples[0], such as the “2D platformer camera” example [1] (playable from the examples webpage)? It&#x27;s really not a lot of code at all to get a basic playable game going—then from there, you just make more structs, store struct instances in arrays, and loop through the arrays to do 99% of the things you want a “game engine” to do that aren&#x27;t covered by Raylib library functions.<p>If you made a 2D platformer by starting from that example instead of using something like Unity or Godot, and do as I said above and wrap all Raylib library function calls in your own functions, then, in the absolute worst case, tomorrow you wake up and find out that Raylib has, for some reason, gone all “Our Machinery”[2] and deleted its public source repositories and informed you that you&#x27;re legally obligated to delete all Raylib code on your machine. Not a problem—just switch to SDL or SFML or bgfx (for just the graphics) or something similar, spend a couple hours replacing the library function calls in your code, and you&#x27;re good to go! You maintain <i>complete ownership</i> over the <i>vast bulk</i> of your game&#x27;s code, <i>because you wrote it yourself</i>, except for a few library calls which can be easily replaced with something else. This is a <i>much</i> better situation to be in, compared to e.g. the Unity fiasco of last year!<p>&gt; There are many people who love making games but who aren&#x27;t software devs<p>This idea still baffles me—why do people try to make <i>video</i> games while abstaining from learning anything at all about software development? Like there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using higher-level tools as a means of learning the very basics of the craft—that&#x27;s how I started out, too. But wanting to learn a high-level tool and then <i>stopping there and learning nothing more</i> is like wanting to be an artist but never learning any art fundamentals and using an AI generator instead.[3] Video game development as a whole is extremely difficult, and a craft that should either be taken remotely seriously (especially if you wish to self-describe as a “game developer”!!), or taken extremely casually. If you want to take it extremely casually, then by all means continue to refrain from engaging with even baseline software development knowledge and principles. But if you want to take it seriously, because, for example, you wish to <i>sell the software you&#x27;ve made to other people</i> so they can <i>run it on their computers</i>, then really, making a “game engine” is the <i>least</i> of your concerns as a game developer.

But, it’s not easy, even when you use a pre-existing framework like Raylib. I’ve used frameworks like Monogame, I’ve used bare metal C++ and OpenGL, I’ve used the HTML canvas and JavaScript, I’ve built physics engines and used physics engines like Box2D or Havok. What I’m trying to say is I’ve done a lot of game engine-y stuff at various levels of the stack.<p>I’ve _also_ used Godot, Unity and Unreal. There’s a tremendous difference. I just started learning Godot a week ago and I already have the core game loop practically done in a new RPG. Sure I could’ve done the same thing using C++ and OpenGL (or Raylib or something), but I would be missing out on a lot of useful things that _just work_. Godot’s BBCode text labels are amazing and give my dialogue boxes a whole bunch of character out of the box. The tilemap editor allows me to just build my levels without having to build an editor first. The lighting system can add a ton of visual polish with very little effort on my part.<p>I’ve also dabbled in VR games with Unreal. And I’ve tried making some simple 3D games in Unity. Is this all possible without those engines? Yea. Would I have been able to experiment with the kinds of tech I got to play with if I made it all myself from scratch? I doubt it (not because I couldn’t do it, I just don’t have the time).<p>Another thing to consider is porting your game to different platforms! There’s a whole lot of variability in what kind of support you’ll get for that with something you made yourself or a framework like Raylib.<p>Anyways, from someone who has experienced both sides of the coin, you’ll end up fighting with the engine either way ;) There’s nothing wrong with using a general purpose engine.</div><br/><div id="41782454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41782454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adamrezich</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41782299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41783516">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41782454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41782454">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Would you not say that learning how one could possibly make a game without using someone else&#x27;s engine that does everything for you made you a better game developer, even if you end up choosing to use one?</div><br/><div id="41782668" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41782668" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_gabe_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41782454">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41783516">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41782668">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41782668">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That’s completely besides the point.

Yes people bikeshed etc. but when you create your own engine you are _fiercely_ aware of _everything_ it can and can&#x27;t do. As part of this, it&#x27;s very easy to feel fully in command of your own toolset, and as such able to exhibit mastery over that toolset.&quot;<p>Yeah the really compelling thing to me is the knowledge building. For example what I do with my own project is that I take a look at some demo or example, let&#x27;s say in Gamemaker or GDevelop and I ask myself a few questions:<p><pre><code>  a) how is the sausage made?
  b) can I make the sausage and what are my ingredients?
  c) if I can&#x27;t make the sausage yet, what do I need in order to make the sausage?
</code></pre>
For me this has been really the best way to build rather &quot;deep&quot; knowledge in this domain, as in knowing how something works under the hood (or how I think it works or at least how my version of it works) vs. knowing how to use it in Gamemaker &#x2F; GDevelop.<p>Ps. your github could use some screenshots I think</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41780219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41780219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slmjkdbtl</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780880">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41779815">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41780219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41780219">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think most &quot;I want to make an engine so I can make games faster&quot; people are cursed to make engines forever, this is rare.</div><br/><div id="41780709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41780709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Cthulhu_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780219">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41780931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41780709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41780709">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At least that&#x27;s a goal, a lot of people say &quot;I want to make a game&quot; but get stuck in the making an engine part.

Don&#x27;t start with your own engine   since this will suck all your time and you&#x27;ll end up spending 90% on engine and very little getting the game game done. Especially so in the beginning when you have no features and doing anything in the game requires engine work.<p>If you choose to create your own engine it&#x27;s a compelling and fantastic domain where problems come in all shapes and sizes and you can and get to work with physics, maths, linear algebra, audio, rendering, graphics APIs, system level programming, most likely native programming AND scripting, game content, technical art etc.<p>But finally the real work is not the engine but the tooling and the editor around the engine.<p>If (when) you rely on free assets from (for example opengameart) you can expect no consistency. Not just the art style but just the technical part too, like your models are all inconsistent in shapes and sizes and axis, 2D content such as textures are by default without any meta data etc. So  you really need to create a ton of tooling so that you can have sensible workflows and you can extract and consume the usable and interesting parts of any content package easily.<p>This inevitably leads to the concept of &quot;editor&quot; which easily comes with a ton of work by itself that has nothing to do with game or game engine per se. For example the concept of &quot;Project&quot;, windows, resource management, basic editing functionality for creating content, undo&#x2F;redo&#x2F; etc. A lot of this is not really related to the game or the engine in anyway but you really sort of &quot;must have it&quot; if you want to create something that is actually usable.<p>The feature creep is real! But once you get the over a lot of the boiler plate and you can actually use your own editor to stuff content into your own engine and have it running it&#x27;s really a nice feeling even if nobody else cares!<p>On the technical side my advice is really to be able to do first principles type of thinking. It&#x27;s of utmost importance to be able to break things apart into self contained features and pieces that the <i>game</i> can then combine to create bigger constructs.<p>If you can have your materials scroll textures vertically, when you combine that with shapes that are layered and place textures onto those shapes that scroll at various multiples of your &quot;characters&quot; speed then you&#x27;ve just created &quot;parallax scrolling&quot; essentially.<p>-----<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ensisoft&#x2F;detonator">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ensisoft&#x2F;detonator</a></div><br/><div id="41780536" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41780536" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matthewkayin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41780946">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41780536">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41780536">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I often hear the advice to &quot;make games, not game engines&quot;, and it&#x27;s refreshing to hear it from someone who is actually working on an engine themselves, because usually when I hear this advice it&#x27;s from devs who use Unity&#x2F;Godot&#x2F;Unreal, and the implication I get is that if you&#x27;re not using one of those engines, you&#x27;re wasting your time and won&#x27;t ever make a game.<p>But I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a middle ground between using an existing engine and making your own general-purpose engine from scratch. I&#x27;ve been making a 2D RTS using C++&#x2F;SDL, and it&#x27;s taken me longer to write it this way than if I had used an existing engine, but in only a few months I&#x27;ve reached the point where I have a prototype and have had multiple playtests and am iterating the prototype based on feedback from those playtests.<p>So, while the advice &quot;make games, not game engines&quot; is still definitely true, it doesn&#x27;t mean that if you code &quot;from scratch&quot; that your game will necessarily be a long 4-year engine project (unless you want it to be!).

My best advice is only write enough engine to support the game you want to make. Also don&#x27;t try and write an editor, but add debug&#x2F;editor tools directly in the game. With each game you make, you can add one or two new features to the engine, and slowly build up the feature set to be able to make larger games.</div><br/><div id="41780407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41780407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onikolas7</span><span>|</span><a href="#41780089">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41780320">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41781900">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41780407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41780407">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Totally agree!

Again the key is to build only what you need and only when you need it.

Those tools are software behemoths, by design, because they have to account for all possible use cases and give people a way of opting in to any possible combination of provided features, along with providing various abstractions (scene hierarchy, gameplay scripting, graphics API abstraction, materials, VFX, animation state trees, etc., the list is seemingly endless) as they need to support making essentially any kind of game.<p>And not only are they software behemoths, they also represent a huge amount of mindshare in the form of documentation, support, community, customer-provided content, (marketplace assets) and so on.<p>If you&#x27;re making a game and you know what your requirements are up front, it&#x27;s possible you just don&#x27;t need most of what the engine provides.<p>If you don&#x27;t need to support multiple graphics APIs, you can get away with just using the specific API yourself (and then you don&#x27;t need a different shading language). If you don&#x27;t need complex VFX you might not need a VFX graph. If your rendering code is closer to your gameplay code you don&#x27;t need a separate gameplay scripting system, you could actually write your gameplay code in the same language and build them together. Don&#x27;t need rigid body simulation? Great! Throw that away. Don&#x27;t need RVTs? Goodbye. And so on.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean throwing away some engine-like structure, you&#x27;ll almost certainly still end up with some representation of a scene, but if your requirements are minimal you can get away without most of what&#x27;s in the above tools.<p>And there&#x27;s always the middle ground (that seems to get forgotten). Open source rendering libraries such as Ogre integrated into your own program, such that your game stops being a completely isolated component that sits on top of the engine and is regular code integrated with rendering (and so on), while being a more cohesive whole.<p>Of course, if you need the features in Unity or Unreal and you don&#x27;t have five years to burn then maybe you should just use them after all.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41779824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41779824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">delduca</span><span>|</span><a href="#41779805">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41780637">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41783771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41779824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41779824">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I totally agree, or if I were in a game jam, but in my case it’s just for fun.

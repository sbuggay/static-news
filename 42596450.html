Specialists are like cogs in a machine - they can be swapped in and out with relative ease, compared to a generalist part&#x2F;employee that does a lot of undefined, important tasks. Specialists are like puzzle pieces of a very precise shape, while generalists are like natural materials with no two sharing the same shape.<p>Tech companies consider their brain trusts like they consider their machines - a conglomeration of specialized systems with specific tasks and roles. They want us all to be square pegs that fit into their square holes. I find myself frustrated with this method of work, especially when mentors and managers suggest that we all should give in to this specialist mindset and train up in one specific area, to the detriment of other fields.<p>The world is endlessly fascinating and I want to learn about it all. I want to live in different places, learn different skills, have different chapters in my life with different focuses. I can&#x27;t bear the thought that 10 years from now, my mind might be exactly the same as it is today, with no growth and no difference in thinking. I think a great way to avoid that stagnation is to think different thoughts, to change one&#x27;s mind frequently, and to not get sucked into shortcuts for thinking.<p>One common shortcut prevalent in Western society currently is that profitability is a direct proxy for value, and that we must constantly maximize value&#x2F;profitability. &quot;Hustle culture&quot; is a great example of this - is there something you enjoy in your life? Monetize it! Don&#x27;t consider the fact that the pursuit of money might actually destroy your love of the hobby.

A nice book that helped me get past some mental blocks and really embrace learning whatever it is I&#x27;m interested in, without reservations on what others may think about such &quot;distractions&quot;.<p>- The Creative Way by Rick Rubin. This masterpiece is written by a legendary musical producer who has probably worked with one of your favorite Western musicians at some point. His Zen-inspired approach to creativity and acceptance of ideas, wherever they may come from, is an essential tool in any polymath&#x27;s toolbox.<p>- How We Got to Now by Steven Johnson. I really enjoyed learning how the world-changing inventions that we take for granted were often invented by creatively gluing together wildly divergent ideas, to ultimately make something that appears deceptively simple.<p>The key takeaway for me is that anyone and everyone can be a polymath, with the correct attitude. Learning is not a skill reserved only for the most intelligent and capable - everyone is capable of learning anything they want.

We used to believe in education in America decades ago, but that message is lost in the noise today.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42598636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42598636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">globalnode</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598724">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42598290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42598636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42598636">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">my solution to this has been do a base degree, then chip away at new areas with diplomas or graduate diplomas&#x2F;certificates and enlarge my knowledge base that way. besides just reading lots of stuff.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42598290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42598290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mschuster91</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598636">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42596853">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42598290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42598290">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Universities have an opportunity and an obligation to train polymaths. The opportunity comes from the emergence of new foundations that unify fields. The obligation arises because humanityâs pressing problems are not neatly confined within academic disciplines. However, the divisive organizations of academic departments and curricula make it hard for faculty and students to understand systemic problems such as climate change, biological diversity, sustainability, and poverty.
Universities might be judged harshly in future for promoting specialization and a cult of expertise
when they could have been training new generations of scholars to understand systems as systems.<p>I absolutely love the general idea the essay promotes - it is completely in line with my opinions in what academia <i>should be</i>.<p>Unfortunately, the author chooses to ignore the elephant in the room: who is going to pay for it? Students are already saddling themselves with six figures of debt in the US, in Germany it&#x27;s at least tens of thousands of euros to cover costs of living, and that doesn&#x27;t allow for &quot;unproductivity&quot; aka learning stuff not relevant to one&#x27;s degree that isn&#x27;t mandatory - and even worse, at least in Germany you <i>have to</i> finish your degree in a specified time or you&#x27;ll get forcibly kicked out. Society doesn&#x27;t give a fuck either, education budgets have been slashed for decades now, partially causing the debt issue in the US as well as the very rigorous rules in Europe. And that&#x27;s noticeable in all the &quot;liberal arts&quot; and other non-STEM degree programs as well - a degree in these courses doesn&#x27;t result in high-paying jobs, which means they&#x27;re mostly rich&#x2F;affluent kids that can afford it, and some of them like Slavic studies have barely any students left at all (which explains both the quality of online discussions regarding anything Eastern European and the quality of Western politics regarding these countries - the reactions to the Russian invasion were so shameful because there were barely any qualified experts to guide politicians!).<p>And to make it worse than it already is, there is a second <i>even larger</i> elephant in the room: the purpose of academia has been completely perverted over the last decades, ever since the &quot;push for education&quot;. Many universities these days are effectively reduced to being degree mills. Employers don&#x27;t care about degrees, they care about universities weeding out undesirable employee candidates (the poor, the disabled, students with mental health issues etc pp - there&#x27;s been many studies done on social strata and academic achievements) so they don&#x27;t violate anti-discrimination laws or risk &quot;duds&quot;. Capitalism has perverted and weaponized academia.<p>(I could go off on a tangentially related issue - who is funding academia in the first place, &quot;chasing grants&quot; taking away research and education time, Germany and its infamous job insecurity for anyone employed in academia and not on a tenure&#x2F;professorship track, but the comment is long and rant-y enough as it is...)</div><br/><div id="42598682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42598682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">syndicatedjelly</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42596853">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42598682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42598682">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why is the author responsible for solving the &quot;elephant in the room&quot; of affordability?

Meanwhile, the people actually pointing out the problems are immediately criticized for not solving the issue, as if there&#x27;s even a single solution or group of solutions that will reform the economy into whatever idealist society people dream of.</div><br/><div id="42599622" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42599622" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mschuster91</span><span>|</span><a href="#42598290">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42598682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42596853">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42599622">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42599622">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Why is the author responsible for solving the &quot;elephant in the room&quot; of affordability?<p>They could have at least <i>mentioned</i> it!

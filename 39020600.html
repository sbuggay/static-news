If you water it it will grow in the desert without further aid. 3) yeast to turn the leaf materials into ethanol.<p>Apparently a tiny chunk of Sahara could make a serious dent in energy consumption. (One can of courses also use biomass to make biogas or solid fuel)<p>Yield is up to 1200 ton per square km. 205.2 ton ethanol per km2 (261 400 liter) 1 539 646 kwh&#x2F;km2 If we use 100 000 000 barrels of oil per year 162 820 000 000 kwh The farm would be 0.1 million km2, the Sahara is 9.2 million km2, it would take little over 1%, say 2% US total farmland area is 3.6 million km2<p>Recycling yeast and chemicals gets much better at scale.<p>We know how to pump crude into container ships but oil is a dangerous substance. Ethanol doesn&#x27;t require state of the art safety measures, it can just spill, the boats can just sink without horrific consequences. On the contrary.<p>The process on that scale leaves behind a lot of stuff that will have to be used for something. Seeds and seed oils are very valuable, hempcreed and bio plastics can be used for construction, can make fabrics, clothes, paper etc<p>One could also make solar biochar and enhance the soil. Hemp by it self enhances the soil. Add some compost and some bio char and you should be able to grow other things too.<p>The surprising thing to me was that there is a lot of ongoing research for each component of the plot.

What is the climate impact of it?<p>Biochar is carbon negative, it sequesters carbon.<p>Approximately ~ tree falls down, rots and it all gets turned back to methane -&gt; CO2.<p>Instead you pyrolysis (burn in low oxygen) the tree, I use the cone dug in ground method. This releases part of the CO2 and also stores a lot of the carbon, as you partly can see when they study 10,000 year old campfires.<p>Then in theory you save on fertilizer and water as it averages it out and microbes process it better, which also reduces CO2. It also lowers compaction which makes for better plant root systems.<p>Our local government sewerage (which we are not on) gets turned to biochar and put in fields.<p>Biochar is a culture, it&#x27;s beginnings are from the Amazon Dark Earth, I&#x27;m more into the science. People always have to talk about peeing on their biochar, sigh.... and they send their biochar off to be tested on how many football fields surface area per cubic inch ie one gram of biochar can have over 12,00 square feet of surface area. I&#x27;m not so sure on this, I think it&#x27;s over maximization. Testing in the garden is good though, so I shouldn&#x27;t complain.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39023286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39023286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tastyfreeze</span><span>|</span><a href="#39021637">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39022114">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39023296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39023286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39023286">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Use your nitrogen rich grass clippings to compost some of your carbon and load charcoal to make biochar.</div><br/><div id="39024883" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39024883" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tudorw</span><span>|</span><a href="#39021637">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39023286">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39023296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39024883">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39024883">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you don&#x27;t have grass clippings, you can buy alfalfa fairly cheaply and it&#x27;s packed with nitrogen.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39023296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39023296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">waldothedog</span><span>|</span><a href="#39021637">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39023286">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39023296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39023296">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do you have room for a small compost pile?

In each case what the analysis is attempting to achieve is different, but in no case does it operate to prohibit similarity, per se.<p>The Wikipedia page points out two meanings. The first is a rule for establishing provenance. Copyright protects originality, not novelty. The difference is that if two people coincidentally create identical works, one after another, the second-in-time creator has not violated any right of the first. (Contrast with patents, which do protect novelty.) In this context, substantial similarity is a way to help establish a rebuttable presumption that the latter work is not original, but inspired by the former; it&#x27;s a form of circumstantial evidence. Normally a defendant wouldn&#x27;t admit outright they were knowingly inspired by another work, though they might admit this if their defense focuses on the second meaning, below. The plaintiff would also need to provide evidence of access or exposure to the earlier work to establish provenance; similarity alone isn&#x27;t sufficient.<p>The second meaning relates to the fact that a work is composed of multiple forms and layers of expression. Not all are copyrightable, and the aggregate of copyrightable elements needs to surpass a minimum threshold of content. Substantial similarity here means a plaintiff needs to establish that there are <i>enough</i> <i>copyrightable</i> <i>elements</i> in common. Two works might be near identical, but not be substantially similar if they look identical merely because they&#x27;re primarily composed of the same non-copyrightable expressions, regardless of provenance.<p>There&#x27;s a third meaning, IIRC, referring to a standard for showing similarity at the pleadings stage. This often involves a superficial analysis of apparent similarity between works, but it&#x27;s just a procedural rule for shutting down spurious claims as quickly as possible.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40921800" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40921800" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">talldayo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40920723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40921609">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922450">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40921541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40921800">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40921800">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Point is, the legal system is highly selective when it comes to corporate interests.<p>I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s that.

It&#x27;s specifically about substitution, and to that end, I don&#x27;t see a good argument that Co-Pilot substitutes for any of the works it was trained on. No one is buying a license to co-pilot to replace buying a license to Photoshop, or GIMP, or Linux, or Tux Racer. Nor is Github selling co-pilot for that use.<p>To the extent that a user of co-pilot could induce it to produce enough of a copyrighted work to both infringe on the content (remember that algorithms are not protected by copyright) and substitute for the original by licensing in lieu of, I would expect the courts to examine that in the ways it currently views a xerox machine being used to create copies of a book. While the machine might have enabled the infringement, it is the person using the machine to produce and then distribute copies that is doing the infringing not the xerox machine itself nor Xerox the company.<p>Specifically in the opinion the court says:<p>&gt;If an original work and a secondary use share<p>&gt;the same or highly similar purposes, and the secondary use<p>&gt;is of a commercial nature, the first factor is likely to<p>&gt;weigh against fair use, absent some other justification for<p>&gt;copying.<p>I find it difficult to come up with a good case that any given work used to train co-pilot and co-pilot itself share &quot;the same or highly similar purposes&quot;. Even in the case of say someone having a code generator that was used in training of co-pilot, I think the courts would also be looking at the degree to which co-pilot is dependent on that program. I don&#x27;t know off hand if there are any court cases challenging the use of copyright works in a large collage of work (like say a portrait of a person made from Time Magazine covers of portraits), but again my expectation here is that the court would find that while the entire work (that is the magazine cover) was used and reproduced, that reproduction is a tiny fraction of the secondary work and not substantial to its purpose.<p>Similarly we have this line:<p>&gt;Whether the purpose and character of a use weighs in favor<p>&gt;of fair use is, instead, an objective inquiry into what use<p>&gt;was made, i.e., what the user does with the original work.<p>Which I think supports my comparison to the xerox machine. If the plaintiffs against Co-Pilot could have shown that a substantial majority of users and uses of Co-Pilot was producing infringing works or producing works that substitute for the training material, they might prevail in an argument that co-pilot is infringing regardless if the intent of github.

Nothing is going to be the final word until more of these cases are heard. But I still don&#x27;t think Warhol is as strong even against other uses of generative AI, and in fact I think in some ways argues in their favor. The court in Warhol specifically rejects the idea that the AWF usage is sufficiently transformed by the nature of the secondary work being recognizably a Warhol. I think that would work the other way around too, that a work being significantly in a given style is not sufficient for infringement. While certainly someone might buy a license to say, Stable Diffusion and attempt to generate a Warhol style image, someone might also buy some paints and a book of Warhol images to study and produce the same thing. Provided the produced images are not actually infringements or transformations of identifiably original Warhol works, even if they are in his style, I think there&#x27;s a good argument to be made that the use and the tool are non-infringing.<p>Or put differently, if the Warhol image had used Goldsmith&#x27;s image as a reference for a silk screen portrait of Steve Tyler, I&#x27;m not sure the case would have gone the same way. Warhol&#x27;s image is obviously and directly derived from Goldsmith&#x27;s image and found infringing when licensed to magazines, yet if Warhol had instead gone out and taken black and white portraits of prince, even in Goldsmith&#x27;s style after having seen it, would it have been infringing? I think the closest case we have to that would have been the suit between Huey Lewis and Ray Parker Jr. over &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; but that was settled without a judgement.<p>I do agree that Warhol is a stronger argument against artistic AI models, but it would very much have to depend on the specifics of the case. The AWF usage here was found to be infringing, with no judgement made of the creation and usage of the work in general, but specifically with regard to licensing the work to the magazine. They point out the opposite case that his Campbell paintings are well established as non-infringing in general, but that the use of them licensed as logos for soup makers might well be. So as is the issue with most lawsuits (and why I think AI models in general will win the day), the devil is in the details.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40922347" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40922347" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">belorn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40920723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922141">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922605">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40921541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40922347">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40922347">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A key finding that the judge said in the Authors Guild v.

These are the consequences.<p>&quot;At present the holder of copyright has the public feeling on his side. Those who invade copyright are regarded as knaves who take the bread out of the mouths of deserving men. Everybody is well pleased to see them restrained by the law, and compelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesman of good repute will have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions. Pass this law: and that feeling is at an end. Men very different from the present race of piratical booksellers will soon infringe this intolerable monopoly. Great masses of capital will be constantly employed in the violation of the law. Every art will be employed to evade legal pursuit; and the whole nation will be in the plot. On which side indeed should the public sympathy be when the question is whether some book as popular as “Robinson Crusoe” or the “Pilgrim’s Progress” shall be in every cottage, or whether it shall be confined to the libraries of the rich for the advantage of the great-grandson of a bookseller who, a hundred years before, drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author when in great distress? Remember too that, when once it ceases to be considered as wrong and discreditable to invade literary property, no person can say where the invasion will stop. The public seldom makes nice distinctions. The wholesome copyright which now exists will share in the disgrace and danger of the new copyright which you are about to create. And you will find that, in attempting to impose unreasonable restraints on the reprinting of the works of the dead, you have, to a great extent, annulled those restraints which now prevent men from pillaging and defrauding the living.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepublicdomain.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;macaulay-on-copyright&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepublicdomain.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;macaulay-on-copyr...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40923589" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923589" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TylerE</span><span>|</span><a href="#40920723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922296">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40924156">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40922221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923589">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923589">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For that matter, if you think China ripping everyone else off is bad now… well, just wait until every company can do that.</div><br/><div id="40924308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40924308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Qwertious</span><span>|</span><a href="#40920723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40923589">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40924866">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40924308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40924308">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If everyone could do it, it wouldn&#x27;t be as big a deal - small western businesses would be on a more level playing field, since they would be almost as immune from being sued by big businesses as Chinese businesses are.

Citra was started by Yuzu developers and as part of the settlement they were not able to continue working on it. Citra&#x27;s development had long been for the most part taken over by different developers, but the Yuzu people were still hosting the online infrastructure and had ownership of the GitHub repository, so they took all of it down. Some of the people who were maintaining Citra before the lawsuit opened up a new repository, but development has slowed down considerably because the taking down of the original repository has caused an unfortunate splintering of the community into many different forks.<p>There is some speculation Nintendo was involved with the death of the Nintendo 64 emulator UltraHLE a long time back, but this was never confirmed. If indeed they did go after UltraHLE, then this would just like Yuzu be a case of them taking down an emulator for a console they were still profiting from, as UltraHLE was released in 1999.<p>The most famous example of companies going after emulators is Sony, which went after Connectix Virtual Game Station and Bleem!. Both were PS1 emulators released in 1999, a period during which Sony was still very much profiting from PS1 sales. Sony lost both lawsuits and hasn&#x27;t gone after emulators since.<p>In 2017, Atlus tried to take down the Patreon page for RPCS3, a PS3 emulator. However, Atlus only went after the Patreon page, not the emulator itself, which they did because of their use of Persona 5 screenshots on said page. The screenshots were simply taken down and the Patreon page was otherwise left alone. Of note is that Atlus is a game developer, so they were never profiting from PS3 sales.

Not intending to take someone&#x27;s property doesn&#x27;t mean it becomes your property. You <i>might</i> get less penalties and&#x2F;or charges, due to intent (the obvious examples being murder vs manslaughter, etc).<p>But here we have an entire ecosystem where the model is &quot;scan copyrighted material&quot; followed by &quot;regurgitate that material with mechanical changes to fit the surrounding context and to appear to be &#x27;new&#x27; content&quot;.<p>Moreover given that this &#x27;new&#x27; code is just a regurgitation of existing code with mutations to make it appear to fit the context and not directly identical to the existing code, then that &#x27;new&#x27; code cannot be subject to copyright (you can&#x27;t claim copyright to something you did not create, copyright does not protect output of mechanical or automatic transformations of other copyrighted content, and copyright does not protect the result of &quot;natural processes&quot;, e.g &#x27;I asked a statistical model to give me a statically plausible sequence of tokens and it did&#x27;). So in the best case scenario - the one where the copyright laundering as a service tool is not treated as just that, any code it produces is not protectable by copyright, and anyone can just copy &quot;your work&quot; without the license and (because you&#x27;ve said if you weren&#x27;t intending to violate copyright it&#x27;s ok) they can say they could not distinguish the non-copyright-protected work from the protected work and assumed that therefore none of it was subject to copyright. To be super sure though they weren&#x27;t violating any of your copyrights, they then ran an &quot;AI tool&quot; to make the names better and better suit your style.<p>I am so sick of these arguments where people spout nonsense about &quot;AI&quot; systems magically &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;knowing&quot; anything - they are very expensive statistical models, the produce statistically plausible strings of text, by a combination of copying the text of others wholesale, and filling the remaining space with bullshit that for basic tasks is often correct enough, and for anything else is wrong - because again they&#x27;re just producing plausible sequences of tokens and have no understanding of anything beyond that.<p>To be very very very clear: if an AI system &quot;understood&quot; anything it was doing, it would not need to ingest essentially all the text that anyone has ever written, just to produce content that is at best only locally coherent, and that is frequently incorrect in more or less every domain to which it is applied. Take code completion (as in this case): Developers can write code without essentially reading all the code that has ever existed just so that they can write basic code, because developers understand code. Developers don&#x27;t intermingle random unrelated and non-present variables or functions in their code as they write, because they understand what variables are and therefore they can&#x27;t use non existent ones. &quot;AI&quot; on the other hand required more power than many countries to &quot;learn&quot; by reading as much as possible all code ever written, and then produce nonsense output for anything complex because they&#x27;re still just generating a string of tokens that is plausible according to their statistical model - the result of these AIs is essentially binary: it has been in effect asked to produce code that does something that was in its training corpus and can be copied essentially verbatim, with a transformation path to make it fit, or it&#x27;s not in the training corpus and you get random and generally incorrect code - hopefully wrong enough it fails to build, because they&#x27;re also good at generating code that looks plausible but only fails at runtime because plausible sequence of tokens often overlaps with &#x27;things a compiler will accept&#x27;.</div><br/><div id="40921959" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40921959" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shkkmo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40920723">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40921360">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40924882">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40921959">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40921959">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Also the intent does not matter under law - not intending to break the law is not a defense if you break the law<p>Intent frequently matters a great deal when applying laws.<p>In the specific area of copyright law, it doesn&#x27;t itself make the use non infringing, but it can absolutely impact the damages or a fair use argument.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40924882" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40924882" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">perlgeek</span><span>|</span><a href="#40920723">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40919700">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40924882">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40924882">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From the article:<p>&gt; The anonymous programmers have repeatedly insisted Copilot could, and would, generate code identical to what they had written themselves, which is a key pillar of their lawsuit since there is an identicality requirement for their DMCA claim.

He it was who invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters.<p>Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Ammon. To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved or disapproved.<p>&quot;The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, &quot;This invention, O king,&quot; said Theuth, &quot;will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.&quot; But Thamus replied, &quot;Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess.<p>&quot;For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.&quot;</div><br/><div id="40920820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40920820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ChrisMarshallNY</span><span>|</span><a href="#40919448">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40920318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40921017">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40920820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40920820">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s great!<p>They nailed us, what, four thousand years ago?</div><br/></div></div><div id="40921017" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40921017" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klyrs</span><span>|</span><a href="#40919448">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40920318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40920820">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40920836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40921017">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40921017">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Precisely the quote I was thinking of, thank you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40920836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40920836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">courseofaction</span><span>|</span><a href="#40919448">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40920318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40921017">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40919990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40920836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40920836">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Awesome.

I would be surprised if they can get by with so few.  Consider their numerous summer programs, their need to advertise admissions, how they talk to the media and university rating services, their relations with China, the student lawsuits they face, their need to manage relations with Oxford the political unit, and the multiple independent schools within Oxford, just for a start.  Overall, I fear that Graeber’s managerial intelligence is not up to par, or at the very least he rarely convinces me that he has a superior organizational understanding, compared to people who deal with these problems every day.<p>&gt; A simple experiment would vastly improve this book and make for a marvelous case study chapter: let him spend a year managing a mid-size organization, say 60-80 employees, but one which does not have an adequately staffed HR department, or perhaps does not have an HR department at all.  Then let him report back to us.<p>&gt; At that point we’ll see who really has the bullshit job.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;bull-shit-jobs-theory.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;bu...</a></div><br/><div id="36373468" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36373468" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spencerflem</span><span>|</span><a href="#36373435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36374609">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36373468">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36373468">[94 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What you miss is that the people working the jobs <i>themselves</i> describe their own job as bullshit.

For the same reason I&#x27;ve seen lots of instances of people complaining about leadership decisions, thinking the work could be done differently or more efficiently, questioning priorities, etc. They don&#x27;t have the executive view that is looking across the organization.<p>Not to say executives don&#x27;t put people into bullshit jobs for exactly the reasons Graeber gets at. It&#x27;s just that their (employees) judgement is biased and so there will be false positives.

She&#x27;s told which rows to copy by another person in the department (via email), who in turn is copying them from a third piece of software.

This seems a high bar to clear; it is unsurprising that 37-40% of respondents thought their job didn’t qualify. By contrast, the academics used the European Working Conditions Surveys, which by 2015 had talked to 44,000 workers across 35 countries. They focused on those respondents who thought that the statement “I have the feeling of doing useful work” applied to them “rarely” or “never”.<p>and :<p>&quot;Furthermore, those who work in clerical and administrative jobs are far less likely to view their jobs as useless than those who are employed in roles that Mr Graeber regarded as essential, such as refuse collection and cleaning. Indeed, the researchers found an inverse relationship between education and the feeling of usefulness. Less educated workers were likelier to feel that their jobs were useless.

In Britain, where its level is the highest in Europe, non-graduates under 29 were twice as likely to feel useless as their indebted graduate peers.&quot;<p>In contrast to the high share of bullshit jobs reported by Mr Graeber, in 2015 only 4.8% of respondents in the eu felt their work was useless.

The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms: wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not &quot;voluntary but coerced&quot; (forced labor). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of private property in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist.<p>The worker &quot;[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind.

These admin positions don&#x27;t exist for fun, but rather to address a plethora of new regulations and needs [1]:<p>&gt; Perhaps most controversial is an increasing raft of federal and state regulations that universities must abide by: the Clery Act, which requires campuses to report their crime activity; new Title IX regulations that govern the handling of sexual assault; and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requirements for providing educational records.<p>&gt; In 2013 and 2014 alone, the Department of Education released rules and directives on 10 new sets of issues, ranging from proposed rules on teacher preparation programs to Net Price Calculator requirements to specific regulations for FAFSA verification. Complying with all these rules requires additional staff and additional money. The resources required are not insignificant: a Vanderbilt study of 13 colleges and universities found that regulatory compliance comprises 3 to 11% of schools’ nonhospital operating expenses, taking up 4 to 15% of faculty and staff’s time.<p>&gt; “It is pages and pages and pages of regulations that require more sophisticated professionals,” says Penny Rue, vice president for Campus Life at Wake Forest University and board chair-elect of the National Association of Student Affairs Professionals. Rue adds that incidents on college campuses, such as the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, contributed to a need for administrative spending that often goes unnoticed, from case management services to threat assessment teams.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;carolinesimon&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;05&#x2F;bureaucrats-and-buildings-the-case-for-why-college-is-so-expensive&#x2F;?sh=2ca4824b456a" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;carolinesimon&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;05&#x2F;bureau...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36373781" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36373781" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">in3d</span><span>|</span><a href="#36373435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36375388">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36376836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36373781">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36373781">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">UC Berkeley has 400 full and part-time staff to run DEI programs, might be a better example.</div><br/><div id="36373887" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36373887" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ForHackernews</span><span>|</span><a href="#36373435">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36373781">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36376836">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36373887">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36373887">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everyone thinks inclusion is bullshit until they&#x27;re the ones being excluded.

Under the unobjectionable guise of universal values : &quot;diversity, equal-ness, inclusivity&#x27;, it peddles specific political values.<p>It replaces the &#x27;dont-ask-dont-tell&#x27; corporate era with a politicized atmosphere where silence is considered opposition. Diversity in color, but not in opinions. Diversity for census tracked metrics, and none for the rest. Marketed as equality of opportunity, but enforced as equity in outcomes. Inclusivity of every archetype found on a private-American-university-campus and judgement towards everything else.<p>Just as Tobacco companies have the highest ranked sustainability scores, the DEI-iest companies are often the most oppressive in demanding a certain kind of conformity.

People in such a workplace will inevitably disagree on fundamental aspects of society.<p>In the midst of this confusion the university hires self-proclaimed DEI experts with political aspirations, who ask you to read XKendi and Robin DiAngelo.

want to be careful not to put words in their mouth, but if i’m reading them properly and from the many talks i’ve had with Anarchist friends, they would explain that as something like:<p>we should be striving to, when building these systems (building a business&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etc…) to try our best to put a bit more emphasis on <i>not</i> discarding the concerns of the people doing the work. an example would be, management often gets disconnected, siloed, or tunnel visioned in their thinking.<p>for example, an executive might not understand why an engineer sitting in meetings 90% of the time might be frustrated and why this might be hampering forward momentum.  and then, executives when looking at another metric might question “our code is not up to par, why are engineers not producing?” they may never connect the dots that the executives caused the whole thing from the start.<p>if the business&#x2F;org had built into its design where engineers&#x2F;developers doing the work had more of a voice and felt more comfortable using it so their concerns can <i>actually</i> be  heard, those kinds of tensions could be more easily addressed and solve entire classes of issues.<p>while i can see both sides here, i tend to agree with the Anarchist position more, both for productivity and for the overall mental health of those doing the more grunt style work.<p>i’ve worked in both large projects and mid&#x2F;small projects and one of things that i can point to as a constant—if you give people more freedom&#x2F;ownership of a project: they’re going to feel much better about it, they’re going to work harder to complete it, and they’re going to communicate and figure out clever ways to address underlying issues that may stand in the way.  they’re going to feel actual pride in what they helped build.<p>and an opposite constant is: the more alienated someone is, the less ownership they feel over something—the less they give a shit.  at this point their work devolves closer to “just a paycheck.” not only is this incredibly unhealthy for the project, but it makes the people doing the actual work feel worse&#x2F;unfulfilled.  i would argue (and Anarchists seem to as well) this alienation manifests in all kinds unhealthy ripple effects in society.<p>tldr, we should be putting <i>more</i> emphasis on the actual engineers&#x2F;workers overall happiness levels and give them more ownership of their work.  also, when i say “ownership” don’t limit your thinking to “capital ownership.”<p>Anarchists, if im misinterpreting, feel free to chime in and

There is a continuum from explicit feudal leftovers of this type to receptionists and front-desk personnel at places that obviously don’t need them.<p>This example speaks to me because I recall many years ago using an elevator in Rio de Janeiro which had an operator, and although his job was ostensibly to push the buttons, he was in fact part of the security apparatus - the friendly outer layer of a defence-in-depth strategy.<p>Not bullshit at all.<p>Now that’s not to say that organizational dysfunction doesn’t exist. I’ve seen people get hired and then the project that motivated the hiring has lost funding and the person has been idle. I’ve seen managers go on long-term sick leave and their +1 being too busy to find a replacement or provide supervision themselves, leaving teams directionless. I’ve seen people work really hard on bad ideas that didn’t fail fast enough.<p>Those people absolutely described their jobs as bullshit, but it was <i>circumstantial bullshit</i>, not an intrinsic property of the job.<p>The other angle here is grand purpose. The author denigrates some jobs because they achieve some allegedly amoral outcome. You might think that cosmetics shouldn’t exist, or that if they exist they shouldn’t be advertized.

Bullshit jobs are not just jobs that are useless or pernicious; typically, there has to be some degree of pretense and fraud involved as well. The jobholder must feel obliged to pretend that there is, in fact, a good reason why her job exists, even if, privately, she finds such claims ridiculous. There has to be some kind of gap between pretense and reality.

I remember there&#x27;s a passage where he says something like &quot;It impossible to have a <i>relationship</i> with an inanimate object&quot;, where the implication is: if something is &quot;yours&quot;, that is a fact about your relationship with other human beings, not a fact about the universe. This idea is a rephrasing of Proudhon&#x27;s line &quot;Property is theft&quot;.<p>The intro chapter has an anecdote about discussing IMF loan forgiveness which also is an amazing demonstration about how debt relationships often reflect existing power relationships between people, and are used to perpetuate those existing structures.<p>There&#x27;s a chapter wherein he describes how in french colonies, the administration convinced the locals to use their currency, having used none before. The method was to impose a debt (through a tax) on the population, payable only in that currency. Then the population will be forced to carry out whatever economic activities get them that currency (such as selling their crops to Frenchmen). This chapter also serves as a counterargument to the right-libertarian&#x2F;laissez-faire view that states and markets are opposed forces--in fact it is often states which cause markets to exist.<p>He has a thesis I can&#x27;t quite recall about why different periods of history are dominated by gold&#x2F;instrinsically valuable currency vs. forms of IOUs, I can&#x27;t immediately recall the details.

Having said that I do believe that there are some areas where influx of money causes the empire building (some teams at large tech companies and ballooning admin staff in universities are probably two examples I immediately think of).</div><br/></div></div><div id="36377764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36377764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nazgulnarsil</span><span>|</span><a href="#36373724">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36376289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36377764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36377764">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bullshit jobs are often about obfuscating liablity with extra layers such that the information that would render someone liable can be split up between several different people.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36376289" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36376289" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">laurex</span><span>|</span><a href="#36377764">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36373868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36376289">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36376289">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having recently read this book, it’s worth noting that the last 3 chapters, which are great and could potentially stand alone as a meta analysis of the phenomena the book discusses, are not included in the Anarchist Library version of the book.</div><br/><div id="36377142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36377142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mch82</span><span>|</span><a href="#36376289">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36373868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36377142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36377142">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Out of curiosity, what chapters are missing?

Manual e-mail to ask the supplier for a quote. Manually send that to the purchasing department, who&#x27;ll manually copy it into a purchase order, then manually e-mail it to the person who wants the items, who&#x27;ll manually forward it to the supplier, who&#x27;ll dispatch the goods to the customer, who&#x27;ll manually e-mail someone to say they&#x27;ve been received, then the supplier will create an invoice and send it by e-mail, to someone who&#x27;ll manually enter it into the finance system where it&#x27;ll <i>eventually</i> get paid (After 30 days? 90 days? Who knows) then the supplier will get e-mailed a PDF and they&#x27;ll manually match the payment up with the invoice.<p>A great deal of manual labour, in other words, to accomplish what Amazon can do for a cent or two. And a lot more opportunities for human error too, when for some unfathomable reason the item descriptions are reworded for the purchase order, or the product is dispatched without the recipient&#x27;s name or to the wrong building.<p>Why? It&#x27;s certainly not to save money, the suppliers who&#x27;ll deal with this stuff understandably mark up the products for their trouble.

But my understanding of the sector was that it was aimed to fix these issues. Organisational refactoring, if you will.<p>Likewise, everyone complains about bad management, but <i>good</i> management is supposed to be able to fix the kind of issues Graeber describes. Steve Jobs&#x27; return to Apple in the late 90s is a famous example.<p>Years ago on this site someone who worked in senior management in a tech company told a story. It went something like this: there were two teams in the company, who were always complaining, not very productive, and seemed to waste enormous amounts of time and energy on pointless busywork or trying to coordinate tasks. Everyone on team A blamed team B, everyone on team B blamed team A, etc, etc. The manager realised this needed to be fixed, talked to the relevant people on both teams, figured out what the problem was, and ... fixed it. (I have no recollection of what the actual problem was -- let&#x27;s suppose it was some kind of communication or process issue.) After that, things ran smoothly.<p>Is this story realistic? No doubt -- after all anyone who has worked in engineering is familiar with chronic technical problems that can be fixed with very small amounts of work -- if one has the requisite knowledge. And no doubt there are chronic human problems that are similarly solvable.<p>Anyway - after many rounds of such management fixes you would have an organisation that ran like a swiss watch. In such places, good managers, like good sysadmins, fade into the background and become invisible. Google in the 2000s may have been a good example. But eventually either the organisation grows, or the good managers leave, or -- most likely -- people decide they no longer need to worry about good management, the organisation begins to rot, and eventually they&#x27;re forced to bring in bad management. Corporate entropy proceeds in the usual way, and you end up with waste, bad practices, poor communication, doomed projects, crappy output, politics, and -- BS jobs.<p>This is why I&#x27;m skeptical of political intellectuals like Graeber who note a problem but misidentify the solution. Some of the things he categorises as &quot;BS jobs&quot; are themselves intended to <i>fix</i> BS jobs.<p>But I do not have much experience working in large organisations, so perhaps someone else can chime in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36375371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36375371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">z3t4</span><span>|</span><a href="#36375100">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36374966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36375371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36375371">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel cheated that I have to work more then 15 hours per week just to afford a home for my family and put food on the table.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36374966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36374966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sfblah</span><span>|</span><a href="#36375371">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36377403">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36374966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36374966">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Let&#x27;s assume for sake of argument that the author&#x27;s thesis is more or less accurate.

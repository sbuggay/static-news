There will be corner cases, there will be errors, and there will be bugs. There will also be apps for which AI is not helpful at all. But that&#x27;s fine - nobody is saying otherwise. The question is only about whether it is a _significant_ nett saving on the time spent across various project types. The answer to that is a resounding Yes.<p>The entire set of tests for a web framework I wrote recently were generated with Claude and GPT. You can see them here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webjsx&#x2F;webjsx&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;test">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webjsx&#x2F;webjsx&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;test</a><p>On an average, these tests are better than tests I would have written myself.

One of the main obstacles was the problem of maintaining the generated code.<p>IOW: how should we treat generated code?<p>If we treat it in the same way as code produced by humans (ie. we maintain it) then the maintenance cost grows (super-linearly) with the amount of code we generate. To make matters worse for LLM: since the code it generates is buggy it means we have more buggy code to maintain. Code review is not the answer because code review power in finding bugs is very weak.<p>This is unlike compilers (that also generate code) because we don&#x27;t maintain code generated by compilers - we regenerate it anytime we need.<p>The fundamental issue is: for a given set of requirements the goal is to produce less code, not more. _Any_ code generation (however smart it might be) goes against this goal.<p>EDIT: typos</div><br/><div id="41959769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41959769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mvdtnz</span><span>|</span><a href="#41959723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41958851">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41959769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41959769">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You should NEVER modify generated code.

But they have other important qualities: accountability, humility, legibility, and the ability to learn experientially as well as conceptually.<p>LLM&#x27;s are good at instantiating typical or normal patterns (based on its training data). Skilled testing cannot be limited to typicality, although that&#x27;s a start.

To me and our engineering team, this is a pretty good thing because in the time prioritization matrix, if I can get a higher quality code base with higher test coverage with minimal extra work, I will definitely take it (and in fact it&#x27;s something I encourage our engineering teams to do).<p>Most of the base tests that we use were created originally by some of our best engineers. The patterns they developed are used throughout our code base and LLMs can take these and make our code very consistent, which I also view as a plus.<p>re: Complacency: We actually haven&#x27;t found this to be the case. In fact, we&#x27;ve seen more tests being written with this method. Just think about how much easier it is to review a PR and make edits vs write a PR.

I still only use LLMs to bootstrap the implementation, and I finish it myself.

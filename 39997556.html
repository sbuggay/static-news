Let&#x27;s stop being so absolutist about these topics.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t that patents exist, intellectual property protection is critical to investment and research. The issue here is two fold:<p>1. Patents usually involve a lot of research — and existed as a way to ensure that competition couldn&#x27;t imitate your product without also making that investment, licensing it from you, etc. If there was no protection, they would immediately undercut you since they don&#x27;t have investment costs to cover. Tech patents, however, are so broad and require so little actual material science that the &quot;protect the investment&quot; part doesn&#x27;t add up.<p>2. Patent offices couldn&#x27;t keep up with the rapid rate of technical advancement and may have granted overly-broad patents for what we would now consider rather general topics. The only effective way to invalidate these patents is expensive and lengthy court proceedings — which is fair, if you think about it, you wouldn&#x27;t want your rights taken away without a defence. But when weaponised, it can count-intuitively stifle the innovation it was trying to protect.<p>What we need is a better criteria and definition of IP which better suits modern industry.</div><br/><div id="39999977" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39999977" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fauigerzigerk</span><span>|</span><a href="#39999590">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39999712">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39999760">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39999977">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39999977">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt;1.

If they do, tough luck to the second person.<p>Still, patents become public from the moment they are filed. So you can scour the patent applications database as well if you fear others have already filed for a patent for something you are trying to do. Of course, that will mean that, if you go ahead with your own implementation and the patent is later granted, you will not be able to claim that you didn&#x27;t know about this, and will face higher damages if you end up in a lawsuit.<p>The principle here is that a company decides to publish some internal discovery instead of keeping it for themselves, and the government in return grants them a limited time monopoly on that invention. The company could instead keep the invention a secret, but in that case, they can&#x27;t stop others from using it, and if someone else patents it, their secret invention can actually infringe on the patent granted to someone else later.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39998936" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39998936" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">irjustin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39997949">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39998684">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39998741">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39999603">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39998936">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39998936">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You have to show that you were already working on it independently which is effectively establishing prior art and you are literally it.<p>How do you do that? beyond my pay grade.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39998434" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39998434" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chessgecko</span><span>|</span><a href="#39997949">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39998354">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39998491">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39998279">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39998434">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39998434">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My read of patent one is that they basically created DNS for storage.

On one hand I’d like them to do more outreach towards the general population, because history has proven time and time again that you cannot trust journalists for vulgarisation. On the other, I don’t want this to turn into a political circus and funding to fluctuate as political parties get interested or not.<p>The good side of this is that science gets done reliably, on predictable budgets that span decades and not years, even the unsexy science that would not set crowds on fire. True, it reduces enthusiasm but you cannot have everything.</div><br/><div id="36452085" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36452085" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">panick21_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36449973">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36454658">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36452085">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36452085">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Their job is to do the work and leave the communication bits to journalists.<p>Yeah but here is the thing. If you systematically exclude journalist. Don&#x27;t give them any access. Hide everything you are doing and not even provide basic video footage of a engine test, they don&#x27;t have anything to work with.<p>And of course that is even more true when Arianespace is flat out hiding damaging information that tax payers should know. And ESA supports them in that.<p>Major issues with Ariane 5 fairings were hidden from the public and it took a long time until it came out.<p>Lets face the facts, ESA has constructed a space monopoly and the monopolist is doing everything to hide its failures from the public, not giving journalist access so they can&#x27;t talk about it. Journalist that are known to ask critical questions are routinely not invited to events.<p>If that is the kind of society you want to live in, be my guest. But I prefer that we actually have some accountability from our tax pair funded agency and monopolist.<p>&gt; The good side of this is that science gets done reliably, on predictable budgets that span decades and not years<p>That&#x27;s just not really true. ESA has as many project go over budget as anybody else. The Ariane 6 is a massive delayed and has a massively increased budget (and no end in sight). And we could talk about many other projects too.<p>The idea that ESA is some unpolitical agency that just executes perfectly is what they want you to believe and they downplay all the issues. Journalist that report on these issues have to find the details the hard way. But because space is so uninteresting in Europe there is not much good reporting on it.<p>Its also not true that ESA is humble and unpolitical. If they have something to brag about they do so pretty relentlessly. Go read ESA and Arianespace comments about SpaceX around 2015-2019, the were basically all over them selfes talking about how much superior they were.<p>And reticently they have done a lot of political lobbying to increase their budget and pushing for European space flight.<p>They do all these things, its just less visible to the public because the public cares less then in the US.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36454658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36454658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">M2Ys4U</span><span>|</span><a href="#36449973">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451581">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451417">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36454658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36454658">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ESA is a step removed from public funding when compared to NASA.<p>NASA is <i>directly</i> accountable to the US Congress, both in terms of the appointment of its director and its budget.<p>ESA is an IGO, and its Director-General is appointed by consensus amongst the member states, and its budget is set by them based on national contributions as well.<p>Not to mention that most also have their own space agencies (of varying capabilities).

NASA and DoD are both committed to buying rockets on commercial rockets, and all of the competitors view engine development as a majorly important.<p>I was trying to convey that NASA hasn&#x27;t been able to systematically embrace efficient reusability. Put differently, in the US, reusability is a thing *despite* the &#x27;old guard&#x27; (NASA hasn&#x27;t pushed the development of reusable vehicles itself, it has merely accepted them when private individuals got frustrated enough to do it themselves), while in Europe, it&#x27;s promising that the ESA itself is invested in reusable rocketry.<p>&gt;Not sure what you mean? ULA is adopting a pretty modern engine. That engine took a while to develop but that isn&#x27;t so surprising. And it isn&#x27;t ULAs fault.<p>I&#x27;m not taking a shot at BE-4, it&#x27;s a modern engine, it&#x27;s reusable and development delays are in the past now. What I&#x27;m saying is that ULA, for its so-called next-gen rocket, plans something as &#x27;dumb&#x27; as &#x27;SMART&#x27; reuse for those engines, which is a waste given their capabilities.<p>Overall, my argument was that NASA and the contractors it has been mostly associated with, are far less invested in truly reusable rocketry (ie not the Shuttle) than Europe is right now.<p>As far as Europe&#x27;s crewed spaceflight capability goes, they do have experience building space station modules. So I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying that they have never even &quot;come close to&quot; crewed spaceflight, but I agree that by my own argument, Europe is not as invested in crewed spaceflight than the US.<p>To explain why this bothers me, as part of Artemis, NASA has repeatedly used the phrase &quot;sustainable presence&quot;, yet the way they behave as an organization does not correspond with wanting to be sustainable. To me it&#x27;s seeming increasingly more likely that Artemis too will fade out after a few landings.</div><br/><div id="36455411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36455411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">panick21_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36450000">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36454933">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451366">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36455411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36455411">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But differently, in the US, reusability is a thing <i>despite</i> the &#x27;old guard&#x27; (NASA hasn&#x27;t pushed the development of reusable vehicles itself, it has merely accepted them when private individuals got frustrated enough to do it themselves), while in Europe, it&#x27;s promising that the ESA itself is invested in reusable rocketry.<p>That is totally wrong. What NASA did do is create a platform for private competition with the hope that some kind of innovation would come out of it his. The policy foundation for this was set up in the 90s and this allowed companies like SpaceX to come up and have the chance to innovate without direct government control.<p>This innovation was then quickly adopted by NASA and DoD who saw that it was useful. NASA and DoD have a much stronger adoption of reusability then anything we see from ESA.<p>Yes, SLS is not reusable unfortunately, but NASA by now can&#x27;t really change that from happening anyway.<p>NASA itself doesn&#x27;t have to be involved in re-usability development because its already solved for them.<p>&gt; while in Europe, it&#x27;s promising that the ESA itself is invested in reusable rocketry.<p>So they are invested in re-usability and yet the first real rocket planned with it might happen in the late 2030s?<p>The reality is that ESA was actively hostile to re-usability literally up to the point of self delusion and then begrudgingly started to do some minor investments in it.<p>&gt; What I&#x27;m saying is that ULA, for its so-called next-gen rocket, plans something as &#x27;dumb&#x27; as &#x27;SMART&#x27; reuse for those engines, which is a waste given their capabilities.<p>ULA is a political creation and its lobbying power depends on using parts from different large companies and that includes solids. Solids make full stack re-usability hard.<p>Now while &#x27;SMART&#x27; re-usability might be &#x27;dumb&#x27; is a whole heck of a lot better then no re-usability of Ariane 6.<p>&gt; NASA and the contractors it has been mostly associated with<p>SpaceX is NASA largest contractor outside of SLS&#x2F;Orion program, and those were adopted before SpaceX was relevant. In recent years SpaceX has won the waste majority of contracts. Blue has one some, and the are in on re-usability. The contractors you mention that are not focused on re-usability have consistently not been winning many contracts.<p>&gt; To explain why this bothers me, as part of Artemis, NASA has repeatedly used the phrase &quot;sustainable presence&quot;, yet the way they behave as an organization does not correspond with wanting to be sustainable. To me it&#x27;s seeming increasingly more likely that Artemis too will fade out after a few landings.<p>I agree that the SLS&#x2F;Orion program is not &#x27;substainable&#x27; or embraces re-usability. But those programs are 15-25 years old and once they started its politics that substain them.<p>If NASA could go back and redo those things today, it would look very different. Politics has force NASA into situation where SLS&#x2F;Orion is politically unkillable and NASA is doing its best to use the rest of their budget to actually make progress.<p>Using the moon lander funding and giving it to Starship is a fantastic move to break SLS only (if fake) claim to relevance.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36451366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36451366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cubefox</span><span>|</span><a href="#36450000">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451607">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451526">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36451366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36451366">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">After Ariane 5, ESA should probably award fixed price contracts to private European rocket startups rather than doing it together with Arianespace.

Before you can sell something you have to develop it, build the factory to build it (many times) and then scale up its operation. That takes years and costs many billions.<p>&gt; The profit from the sales would fund research into their next big product.<p>The whole point of funding is that you can scale faster. This is like a really really basic thing that I expect everybody on Hacker News to understand. SpaceX did the same thing when they moved from Falcon 1 to Falcon 9.<p>&gt; So if SpaceX needs to continue raising cash, they&#x27;re selling the product at a loss, meaning that they&#x27;re not in fact significantly cheaper than the competition. They&#x27;re just dishonest about their pricing.<p>You falsely assume that raising cash implies that products are being sold at a loss. This simply isn&#x27;t the case, and if that is your understand you are simply wrong. By all information we have from analists, journalist and investors, SpaceX core products they currently sell are very profitable for them. And the Falcon&#x2F;Dragon architecture continues to see more investment like pad upgrades and other optimizations.<p>If SpaceX books proved that re-usability doesn&#x27;t work, why would they be valued so highly in the first place. DoD and NASA have recognized this. Pretty much every other rocket company has recognized this. Even competitors ULA and Arianespace have recognized it. To claim that it is all some vast scam by SpaceX is just not a credible argument.<p>Arianespace has made this same accusation that you made, but unlike with the case of Boeing they have not brought this case to the WTO. This very likely is because they know they would lose horrible and expose the fact that they actually have far, far, far more direct subsidy in Ariane Group.<p>Since you don&#x27;t seem to be moved easily I will give you some actually details of what SpaceX actually does with the raise cash. If your assertion were true, that SpaceX raises cash to finance their operation, where did they get the case for these things:<p>Raptor:<p>- Developing the full flow stage combustion engine to fly. They also developed a Raptor Vacuum.<p>- Raptor continues to get a lot of investment, now on the third iteration. Raptor 3 has just complete its first full test fire. It again breaks its record.<p>- Volume Raptor manufacturing line in Hawthorne.<p>- SpaceX is building a new high volume Raptor engine manufacturing facility in McGregor Texas<p>- They are also expanding testing capabilities there to support the high volume manufacturing.<p>Starship:<p>- Huge production facility in South Texas continues to be built up. New major Highbay currently. Additional factory buildings being added right now.<p>- Launch pad and testing facility are being expanded and upgraded.<p>- Starship evolution and development continues, with newer version already being built and even newer version are in competent testing.<p>- Starship heat-shield required a whole new factory, this factory is in Flordia.<p>- Compenents of Starship are also built in SpaceX facotry in Hawthorne<p>- SpaceX adding<p>Starlink:<p>- SpaceX already has the highest volume satellite factory in the world in Seattle.<p>- SpaceX is currently building a new even bigger satellite factory in Austin<p>- SpaceX also need factories to mass produce both ground stations and the terminals.<p>- Given that Starlink makes SpaceX into a global ISP, SpaceX has to set up offices in every country, go threw regulatory processes in every country. That takes capital as well.<p>- After initial Starlink sats were designed and mass produced SpaceX didn&#x27;t stop, Starlink v2 is already being launched with many improvements. Starlink v2 include a complete new propulsion systems, and pioneering inter-satellite laser link.<p>These are all very capital intensive project and labor intensive development projects, funding these things only with the profit from it current business would be insane. And SpaceX simply could not invest in all of these things at the same time if their core business was bleeding money.<p>Starlink is already producing significant cash flow with 1.5 million subscribers. SpaceX announced its now cashflow positive. That is quite an achievement given how new the technology is and that the primary launch vehicle that will reduce cost isn&#x27;t online yet.<p>Starship is of course not yet making much money. The lunar lander contract with the government is milestone based, that means it will only be paid out when goals are achieved. This means SpaceX needs to raise or lend money to do the development and production so that they can then get it back from NASA once milesstones are achieved.<p>What SpaceX has raised:<p>- 2023: 750M<p>- 2022: 2B<p>- 2021: 1.5B<p>- 2020: 2B<p>- 2019: 1.3B<p>- 2018: 500M<p>- 2017: 500M<p>This if for all the things mentioned above.<p>Now lets actually compare SpaceX to some competitors:<p>- Ariane 6, only a marginal upgrade over the Ariane 5 using mostly components already developed for the Ariane 5 ME. Will cost at a minimum 5 billion $ (likely more when its actually done).<p>- SLS rocket has cost 23 billion $ in development cost.<p>- All of Project Kuiper is planned to need 3,236 satellites. Just the launch alone will likely cost Amazon 10 billion $.<p>Given the capital intensity of aerospace projects I think the amount of money SpaceX raised to run 2 of the largest aerospace projects in the history of humanity is pretty damn reasonable.</div><br/><div id="36456057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36456057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">martin8412</span><span>|</span><a href="#36450000">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36455689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36452884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36456057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36456057">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A Elon Musk company valued higher than what makes sense..

If some US startup would announce something like this everybody would shrug and call it par for the course and not particularly innovative.<p>Europe has never developed first stage close cycle engine. The Soviets have mastered close cycle engines as far back as the 60s and even today (at least until the Ukraine war) great Russian&#x2F;Ukrainian engine were for sale. And today many even startups are working on close cycle engines.<p>This engine is another open cycle engine while the world for real competitive launch vehicles is moving to more advanced engines. And those that do not, are not doing it because they want their next generation rocket to be there as soon as possible. While a European rocket with this engine is at least a decade or more out.<p>It is targeted at being reusable and that is good of course but pretty much every modern engine program is gone be restartable and reusable. We don&#x27;t have much information how many times it will be reusable, what its startup mechanism and we just generally don&#x27;t have that much information.<p>So the thing that&#x27;s kind of stunning here is that Esa&#x2F;Arianespace is developing this one next generation engine and keep hyping it and building it up as this next generation engine for Europe. But its really nothing special, there are many engines in development (some much further along) in the US that are just gone be as advanced or more advanced. ESA here looks more like a random startup, rather being a leader in technology:<p>Relativity Space Aeon-R:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W91fO97WAPo">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W91fO97WAPo</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.relativityspace.com&#x2F;terran-r" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.relativityspace.com&#x2F;terran-r</a><p>RocketLab Archimedes:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Archimedes_(rocket_engine)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Archimedes_(rocket_engine)</a><p>Or how about Launcher E-2:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Th1mP0bU9L8">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Th1mP0bU9L8</a>  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launcherspace.squarespace.com&#x2F;engine-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;launcherspace.squarespace.com&#x2F;engine-2</a><p>Ursa Major:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ursamajor.com&#x2F;engines&#x2F;arroway" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ursamajor.com&#x2F;engines&#x2F;arroway</a><p>SpaceX Raptor 3:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;h_5ltDjun3g?t=72" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;h_5ltDjun3g?t=72</a><p>BlueOrigin BE-4:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hdS4azOaF2M">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hdS4azOaF2M</a><p>There are more that we could mention.<p>So Europe hear is more like a small fish in a big pond. And compared to efforts like Raptor, this is many generations behind.<p>This is not big ambition from Europe, but doing the bare minimum to have something that is somewhat modern. But by the time they will get it into a launch vehicle it will look old compare to the competition.<p>The problem is that engine development in Europe is just very slow, and integrating engines to rockets is even slower. Consider the fancy new Vinci Upper Stage engine. It has been in development for over 20 years now, and will likely be 25 year of total time from start of development to first flight.<p>And the worst of it is, the Ariane 6 Upper Stage mass is so heavy that Vinci amazing performance is held back by a terrible structural design. So even as they have this advanced engine, they resulting rocket isn&#x27;t really great.<p>ESA has a very, very long way ahead if they want their rocket to be more then just launcher military launches from its member states.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36451449" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36451449" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">causality0</span><span>|</span><a href="#36450960">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36450462">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36451449">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36451449">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>testing will continue at the end of 2023 at the German aerospace agency DLR’s test site in Lampoldshausen, Germany.</i><p>Uh, so what are they spending the next six months doing?</div><br/><div id="36451818" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36451818" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">martin8412</span><span>|</span><a href="#36451449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36451610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36451818">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36451818">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Preparations for test flight of Ariane 6.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

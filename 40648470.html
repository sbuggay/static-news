The real reason why this course was obsolete was that Mead and Conway so thoroughly won the argument on the idea of creating rigorous abstractions that people don&#x27;t learn any other way.<p>It just seems so obvious today that you can create gates, you can create macros, you can create complex designs, and you can define the interface at every level so you can hook them up and they just work.

Mead transferred his theories about microelectronics and computer science, and Conway and Fairbairn paid him back by developing design methods and tools giving engineers the ability to create integrated circuits of unprecedented complexity on Alto-sized workstations.<p>...If the computer lab -- particularly ((Butler)) Lampson, who commanded management&#x27;s respect -- continued to carp at the money being spent on the hazy potential of VLSI, who knew how long she could survive at PARC?...<p>While discussing this one day with Mead and Fairbairn she realized the problem was not just scientific, but cultural. VLSI had not been around long enough even to generate textbooks and college courses -- the paraphernalia of sound science that, she was convinced, would force everyone else to take it seriously.<p>&quot;We should write the book,&quot; she told Mead. &quot;A book that communicates the simplest, most elegant rules and methods for VLSI design would make it look like a mature, proven science, like anything does if it&#x27;s been around for the ten or fifteen years you normally have behind a textbook.&quot;<p>Mead was skeptical...<p>That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re wrong, she replied. What was the aim of all the technology that surrounded them at PARC, if not to facilitate just the project she was proposing? They had Altos ((computer workstations)) running Bravo ((word processor)), a network to link long-distance collaborators, and high-speed laser-driven Dover printers to produce professional-looking manuscripts.<p>Their collaboration that summer on what became the seminal text of the new technology was only one of Conway&#x27;s efforts to distill and spread the VLSI gospel. The same year she agreed to teach a guest course at MIT (using the first few chapters of the still-maturing textbook), then printed up her lecture notes for instructors at an ever-enlarging circle of interested universities. By mid-1979 she was able to offer an additional incentive to a dozen schools: If they would transmit student designs to PARC over the ARPANET, PARC would arrange to have the chips built, packaged, and returned to the students for testing.<p>((Jim)) Clark understood at once that the computing efficiency VLSI offered was the key to expanding the potential of computer graphics. That summer he essentially relocated to PARC, taking over a vacant office next door to Conway&#x27;s and steeping himself in VLSI lore. Within four months he had finished the Geometry Engine chip, the product of that summer&#x27;s total immersion.</div><br/><div id="40652609" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40652609" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">canucker2016</span><span>|</span><a href="#40649014">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40652593">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40649339">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40652609">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40652609">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Doug Fairbairn: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;computerhistory.org&#x2F;profile&#x2F;doug-fairbairn&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;computerhistory.org&#x2F;profile&#x2F;doug-fairbairn&#x2F;</a><p>Carver Mead: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carver_Mead" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carver_Mead</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40649339" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40649339" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dekhn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40649014">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40655775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40649339">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40649339">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I met her totally at random at a bio conference in hawaii- I sat down next to her at a bar and we started chatting.

At MIT there has been the work on evolving the LISP microprocessors [3,10]. At Stanford, Jim Clark&#x27;s prototype geometry engine, done as a project for MPC79, has gone on to become the basis of a very powerful graphics processing system architecture [9], involving a later iteration of his prototype plus new work by Marc Hannah on an image memory processor [20].<p>[...]<p>For example, the early circuit extractor work done by Clark Baker [16] at MIT became very widely known because Clark made access to the program available to a number of people in the network community. From Clark&#x27;s viewpoint, this further tested the program and validated the concepts involved. But Clark&#x27;s use of the network made many, many people aware of what the concept was about. The extractor proved so useful that knowledge about it propagated very rapidly through the community. (Another factor may have been the clever and often bizarre error-messages that Clark&#x27;s program generated when it found an error in a user&#x27;s design!)<p>9. J.

What was actually happening is that he was trying to research an early IBM supercomputer project, but was not having much luck. There was very little published information, and IBM had apparently lost its records. Smotherman asked on the net for help and Conway responded and gave him a massive amount of information.<p>Here&#x27;s an article that provides more information [1]. Here&#x27;s the first few paragraphs:<p>&gt; Late in 1998, a young researcher delving into the secret history of a 30-year-old supercomputer project at IBM published an appeal for help. As Mark Smotherman explained in an Internet posting, he knew that the project had pioneered several supercomputing technologies. But beyond that, the trail was cold. IBM itself appeared to have lost all record of the work, as if having experienced a corporate lobotomy. Published details were sketchy and its chronology full of holes. He had been unable to find anyone with full knowledge of what had once been called âProject Y.â<p>&gt; Within a few days, a cryptic e-mail arrived at Smothermanâs Clemson University office in South Carolina. The sender was Lynn Conway, one of the most distinguished American women in computer science. She seemed not only to know the entire history of Project Y, but to possess reams of material about it.<p>&gt; Over the next few weeks, Conway helped Smotherman fill in many of the gaps, but her knowledge presented him with another mystery: How did she know? There was no mention of her name in any of the team rosters. Nor was any association with IBM mentioned in her published resume or in the numerous articles about her in technical journals. When he probed, she would reply only that she had worked at the company under a different name--and her tone made it clear there was no point in asking further.<p>&gt; What Smotherman could not know was that his appeal for strictly technical information had presented Lynn Conway with a deeply personal dilemma. She was eager for the story of IBMâs project to emerge and for her own role in the work to be celebrated, not suppressed. But she knew that could not happen without opening a door on her past she had kept locked for more than 30 years.<p>&gt; Only after agonizing for weeks did Conway telephone Smotherman and unburden herself of an extraordinary story.<p>&gt; âYou see,â she began, âwhen I was at IBM, I was a boy.â<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2000-nov-19-tm-54188-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-2000-nov-19-tm-54188...</a></div><br/><div id="40650894" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40650894" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DonHopkins</span><span>|</span><a href="#40650339">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40654848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40650894">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40650894">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for sharing those details, I didn&#x27;t know that.

Having lived as a trans woman in the 90s, it does not match reality though.<p>Management is, always, a mixed bag. More and more managers indeed do not tolerate discrimination, but even in the face of policies, it exists. It <i>certainly</i> existed in the 90s, in very large patches.<p>As for corporate policies, IBM added theirs (gender identity specifically) in 2002. HP had GLEN in 1995 - &quot;Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual employee network&quot;. You&#x27;ll note gender identity isn&#x27;t part of that, though. (And bisexual is a silent B, I guess ;) If anybody knows when they included gender identity, I&#x27;d love to hear about it!<p>Before that, it was patchwork-y, and your best bet was finding a corner of the corporation that was supportive. And never raising your head to far, just in case. (Many of us did anyways, but more often than not, that had indeed the expected outcome)<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m happy and grateful HP &amp; IBM were at the forefront of these policies.

But if I look at my old classmates and think of people with significant sensory issues, social dysfunction and such, it&#x27;s easy to imagine that today, a lot of them would be diagnosed as having at least some form of Asperger&#x27;s today. Just like we had clearly gay kids, and others with behavior that today would indicate gender dysphoria. The kids with ADHD symptoms? They were just too active and refused to concentrate, no diagnosis outside of the most extreme cases.<p>We have different standards and different levels of attention. We don&#x27;t just re-diagnose adults, so it&#x27;s possible that there is a higher rates today. Maybecaused by something you mention, or straight out selection.

A gazillion chemical reactions happen in parallel you will never understand.<p>What is consciousness? The firing of a gazillion synapses you will never fully understand.<p>The three challenging phenomena I described may seem intractable to reductionism, but have seen the greatest progress from reductionist approaches. Most of the greatest and most useful knowledge will be very reductionist in nature. How many transcription factors are needed to turn this skin cell into a stem cell? About 4.

They will ask questions like “if DNA is code, then what corresponds to functions? or exceptions? or data structures?” and end up working backwards from the analogy instead of observing what DNA <i>does</i> and building a mental model from there.<p>(It doesn’t help that the code analogy is very flattering to the programmer’s ego.)</div><br/><div id="39286069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39286069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TeMPOraL</span><span>|</span><a href="#39285643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39285805">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39286069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39286069">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>At one point, it was mechanical automata. Then it was hydraulics. Then it was electrical circuits. Now it is computers.</i><p>Those analogies aren&#x27;t equivalent. At each step, they got more accurate.<p>Computing analogies may be flattering to programmer&#x27;s ego, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they&#x27;re also qualitatively different than what came before, because <i>computer science is effectively a branch of physics now</i>.<p>First, computer science gives us <i>fully abstract mathematical framework</i> that describes calculation independent of the medium - the same CS applies to silicon-based computers, meat-based distributed systems (aka. bureaucracy, societies), neural compute, biochemical compute, substance-less compute implemented using photon interference, whatever. Whatever something is, if we can identify a few patterns we care about, we can view it as a computer. And, like with every math-backed science, as long as the assumptions hold, results of our calculations apply to real-world systems.<p>Secondly, researchers also found fundamental connection between information and energy, computing and thermodynamics. That means we can take an abstract computer and establish bounds on its energy use - like how much energy it takes to flip a bit - conditioned on some environment (IIRC it&#x27;s temperature-dependent, at least). This is the part where CS becomes effectively a branch of physics.<p>Science and mathematics made qualitative jump in the last 100-200 years; we&#x27;re not making crude analogies to other observed processes now, but rather abstract models with known preconditions and a set framework for reasoning within them. This makes viewing biology through lens of computing a good, useful thing. The important bit is to remember that &quot;all models are wrong, some are useful&quot;. If we see that our computing analogies are failing us, perhaps it&#x27;s time to rethink how we map them to territory. Maybe the most useful computing systems are to be demarked differently, or elsewhere.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39285805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39285805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">angiosperm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39285643">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39286069">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39285919">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39285805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39285805">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Michael Levin appears to be demonstrating that cells have a goal-seeking intelligence operating more or less independently of directions from the nucleus. Since literally every cell on earth arose by fission from another cell, the lineage of this intelligence goes back in an unbroken line to their first common ancestor billions of years ago, with natural selection operating on it directly by success at solving problems of survival and reproduction in real time, not just via selection of genes.<p>In a similar way, every membrane in every cell came from extending and then splitting an existing membrane, again more or less independently of the nucleus. Natural selection has operated directly on those membranes, besides its role in adapting the genes that code for subunits of the membranes.<p>The nucleus might be thought of as mainly a library of apparatus that the cell&#x27;s goal-seeking capacity may draw upon as needed. This analogy is necessarily limited because there are innumerable feedback control cycles encoded in genes and repressor and promoter proteins they encode, and enzymes to methlylate or de-methylate start and stop codons.<p>But something is in charge that operates on a shorter scale than those can. We understand very, very little about that intelligence. It is far more capable than we could ever have guessed.

Getting access to DNA files is required yes, but sequencing wasn&#x27;t really the limiting factor.  It started with simply poking around my DNA file and then some friends many of which were only done on 23andme.  Most of the time was spent reading countless papers and making hypothesis, trying to invalidate them and iterating.  Constantly seeking out new ways to look at the problem and going from there.  Every time I got a new DNA file from someone I could see how their dna fit into the current hypothesis.  Because every DNA was different it was a great way to test them.  It anything it made my job easier.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a single snp, but common patterns.<p>Sometimes this has involved using nebula and their whole genome sequencing dna test to get much more accurate data, but more often than not the cheap dna tests most people do were good enough.<p>As for actual programs, I did write some quick and dirty scripts to scan dna files for specific snps, but mostly I would just read them as the parts I needed were not that long.<p>There is a fair amount of phenotype data to start with.   What ultimately started this was knowing 1) that there was a number of conditions that are seen in statistically weird numbers in the LGBT and 2) sex hormone levels in the LGBT are not exactly what you would expect.<p>My goto fun question when talking with someone in the LGBT is if they have hypermobility.  A good percentage do.  In one specific example those with classical like EDS will have 21-OHD and thus POTS and elevated 17-OHP, backdoor DHT production (aka PCOS for women) etc.<p>The real question I have been pondering is what exactly do I do with this as this is just a fun puzzle, not my job, I don&#x27;t work for any school etc.</div><br/><div id="39285047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39285047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">calf</span><span>|</span><a href="#39282742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39283173">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39284610">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39285047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39285047">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t get it.

I agree.  Watching the development of an organism- say, a tardigrade egg that grows over a few days and then hatches- is remarkably edifying.<p>You can see individual cells growing and moving around and then look at another tardigrade egg and see exactly the same cells growing and moving around to the same exact places (this is a feature called eutely- they have a predetermined lineage of cells all arising in the same tree structure from the same original egg cell, which (in many tardigrade species) is in fact a clone of its mother (no fathers rrequired- known as parthenogenesis).<p>I think many people would see that, along wiht other observations, and easily come to the conclusion that specific behaviors were encoded for by individual genes, or that genes act like an architectural blueprint, exactly specifying either intermediate or final states.<p>Instead, in each of those cells is a blob of jelly filled with the genome, which is decorated with all sorts of proteins that are flying around, binding to vairous specific sites, activating and deactivating other sites, which then get turned into RNA and ultimately specific proteins.  These proteins execute a plan encoded in the genome, but they do so probabilistically, with noise immunity, following physical behaviors that can be understood rationally (although in most cases, the number of actual variables is far too large to work with).  And that encoding is extremely complex, more like a collection of weakly linked PDEs (a <i>lot</i> of weakly linked PDEs).<p>There is massive feedback, both positive and negative, that contributes to automatic regulation of components so that the plan proceeds normally.  Many of these regulations lead to extremely non-linear, complex behaviors.  Yet, for all this complexity, fairly straightforward actions that are similar to tardigrades happen in nearly all life.  A sphere forms from an egg.  The egg splits in two cells, then four, then many, retaining the spherical shape.  At some point one of the split cells develops a polarity- one side grows more actively than the other.  This leads to a body development plan (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blastulation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blastulation</a>) that self-generates with mostly local interactions (IE, there&#x27;s no central controlling cell, it&#x27;s more that the cells are just pushing against each other and the result is the right shape).<p>Understanding how genotypes lead to phenotypes has been a massive journey and I have had to unlearn much of what I was originally told, as new data has subsumed previous ones.  That mendelian model of peas with discrete characteristics that segregate on different chromosomes is useful, and does show up in biology, but from what I can tell, it&#x27;s just an easy, special case that we saw early, then geneticists overfit new data on that model.<p>When viewed through evolution as well as development- we start to see how complex phenotypes begin, then evolve to become far more complex.  Early eyes and wings had utility, similar to modern eyes, but far less capable.  Through mutation and selection, the organisms whose eyes worked slightly better were more likely to generate offspring that inherited those properties,leading to even more radiation (into many different types of organisms that all share similar eye properties).<p>I used to think that by this time in my career (I&#x27;m 51), we&#x27;d have been able to address a simple question I asked when I was 18: why is my nose this funny shape that doesn&#x27;t look like other people&#x27;s noses?  What genes &quot;encode&quot; the &quot;blueprint&quot;?  And to be honest, we&#x27;re still really far from answering questions like that, but through a combination of data collection and machine learning, scientists actually are beginning to understand the complex process that leads to funny nose shapes.<p>For those who made it this far, here&#x27;s your prize.

Maybe the computer analogy to cells is not bad, however one has to think of this computer as made of floppy, flexible, self modifying pieces that exchange information and materials with their environment as they compute, and not think about your typical nanolithography or UV laser etched silicone-based chips.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39282697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39282697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GenesAreDefCode</span><span>|</span><a href="#39284210">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39282474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39282697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39282697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Of course &quot;cells are computers and genes are their code&quot; is an oversimplification, but it&#x27;s not a terrible analogy.

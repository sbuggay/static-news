Two judges on the panel that issued the ruling Friday were DeSantis appointees.<p>&gt; One new law makes it illegal after a person has been warned to approach first responders or remain within 25 feet while they are performing a legal duty if the intent is to interfere, threaten or harass them. The new law doesn’t prevent people from recording law enforcement but can require them to move 25 feet back, which can make it more difficult.<p>&gt; The other requires that citizen review boards in Florida – intended to provide independent oversight of law enforcement actions – be re-established so that members are appointed by a sheriff or police chief and that at least one member be a retired law enforcement officer.<p>I wonder if the first will stand up to Constitutional review. I imagine there are many First Amendment protected purposes for recording that may require the recorder to be within 25 feet of the officer. For example, if they&#x27;re recording during windy conditions and need to hear what the officer says. I also wonder how the &quot;intent&quot; will be interpreted by courts. Probably in a way that is most favorable to LEOs.<p>The second law is just a straightforward neutering of citizen review boards.</div><br/><div id="40046699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40046699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">morkalork</span><span>|</span><a href="#40046305">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40048418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40046699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40046699">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What&#x27;s the point of a citizen review board if the sheriff or chief appoints everyone on it?

In that it is predominantly focused on protecting the property interests of the wealthy. (The original police forces grew out of a desire to socialize the costs of protecting merchant investments -- the warehouses and docks and factories in much of the world, and slaves held as property in the south of the U.S.)<p>Prior to uniformed police, communities maintained order themselves -- often through night watches in which everyone participated, or eventually through hiring people to &quot;cover my watch&quot;.<p>Police in the modern era have been used as a threat of violence against common people more or less since their inception in the 1800s, from slave patrols to strikebreaking. They&#x27;ve been used as political assassins killing the political opponents of the state (see Frederick Hampton) to the systematic oppression of gay and trans people (see, for instance, Stonewall inn). Lest these feel like old examples, just this year police shut down a gay bar in Seattle for having &quot;indecent apparel&quot; being worn by the gay men in attendance.<p>I think it&#x27;s absolutely fair for people to think critically about the history and legacy of the institution and wonder, is this the best institution we can imagine to fill this role? Are there better ways to imagine the roles it fills today? Are there systemic issues that need fixing with it?<p>The reason I bring this forward is that any thoughtful critique of the institution is often painted broadly as, &quot;you are just an anarchist who cannot think beyond your slogans!&quot; Perhaps the institution <i>could</i> do with some immiseration.</div><br/><div id="40046797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40046797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JumpCrisscross</span><span>|</span><a href="#40046360">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40046771">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40047377">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40046797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40046797">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Prior to uniformed police, communities maintained order themselves -- often through night watches in which everyone participated, or eventually through hiring people to &quot;cover my watch&quot;</i><p>Dispensing violence as part of these watches was also generally accepted.

Several countries had armies enforce legal codes. Some places had night watches run by their local communities. Some had night watches you could pay to avoid participating in. It was considered quite unpleasant and low class to perform a night watch, so the people paid to do it were often those who could not otherwise find work or found it difficult to work elsewhere.<p>In some societies you could seek justice via a duel, essentially calling out the criminal and relying on social pressure to see the duel adhered to.<p>In England there&#x27;s a system of tithings, shires and shire reeves, individuals who were kept employed and told to keep the peace. The shire reeves could muster people to enforce the law, temporarily.<p>In the 1600s-1800s the monarchs in various countries instituted police forces, but they were typically plainclothes or carried only a symbol of office. (E.g. a badge) These police were closer to what we expect police to be in the modern era, but were not typically or consistently in the same visible, standard uniform. (Though they may have carried, e.g. a sword that might mark them out.)<p>The U.S. also had other police systems, including slave patrols, essentially self formed posses that would ride down escaped slaves.<p>In the 1800s, police forces in England thought, &quot;you know what would deter crime? Visible police!&quot; And they began to standardize uniforms with the intent to <i>prevent crime</i>, rather than react to crime. Prior to this moment, policing was typically reactionary -- an aggrieved party seeking justice. The innovation was that if people saw a neighborhood patrolled by uniformed police, they might believe that area was safer and criminals might go elsewhere.<p>Around the 1860s, this idea really took off, and you see many places copying it.<p>I&#x27;m on my phone, I&#x27;ll dig for sources later.</div><br/><div id="40049796" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40049796" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">red_admiral</span><span>|</span><a href="#40046360">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40047701">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40048729">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40049796">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40049796">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great post, but I feel an aside on the England situation is in order. Prior to police forces, for anything too big for the Shire Reeves or Justices of the Peace to handle, the solution was &quot;send in the army&quot;. This came to head at the Massacre of St Peter&#x27;s Field (often called the &quot;Peterloo Massacre&quot;, for example on its wiki page) where several hundred protesting workers were killed in a cavalry charge in 1819.<p>The massacre caused such public outrage that, among other things, London set up the Metropolitan Police (a.k.a. &quot;the met&quot;) 10 years later. They were deliberately designed to be a non-militarised force: they wore visible uniforms, but they were black instead of the army&#x27;s red; they carried truncheons instead of swords or firearms (this is also why most police in the UK to this day do not carry firearms); they were deliberately &quot;civilian&quot; not &quot;paramilitary&quot;; and they were &quot;answerable to the public&quot; in the words of Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel (under whom the force was set up).

Figuring out what they really need is your job.<p>2) assuming that what you are building is something the user wants - until people use it, you have no proof for this. Lots of startups fall into the trap of building stuff that nobody wants or needs.<p>3) assuming what users ask for is actually what they need -  always figure out why they are asking for this, whether they are actually going to use it if you build it (I&#x27;ve had cases where we built stuff that was never used), and what it is worth to them.<p>4) assuming that what your sales people say the customer wants is actually what they want or need. This one is tricky. I&#x27;ve had sales people go &quot;unless you build X, I can&#x27;t close the deal&quot; and then you build X and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. Reason: the sales person&#x27;s analysis was wrong.<p>Especially with new products, figuring out if it is something users want is tricky. Do users actually like the new thing? They won&#x27;t be asking for it because it is a new thing. You have to pitch and explain the thing to them and even then they still might not get it. Only when you show them the thing and they like it will you get some confirmation that this might be something they want&#x2F;need.<p>The classic example is selling cars when they were invented is that all customers ever asked for was faster horses.</div><br/><div id="38822413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38822413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PH95VuimJjqBqy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38822324">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38822356">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38822413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38822413">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The problem is that no one actually dug in, which is why I say 80% of product people are a net negative.<p>If someone asks for something, dig in.<p>Think about it like this.<p>I go to a mechanic and tell them to replace my alternator.

I’ll grant some people were really enthusiastic about them, but I don’t see that translating into mass market appeal.<p>Even if I’m dead wrong and there’s a throng of people just waiting for a Segway fire sale, it doesn’t invalidate my point. If your product solves the problem by ignoring the economics of your target customer base that’s just as problematic as building the wrong product.<p>Electric scooters have seen a lot more traction. Both teams can’t use the supposed Henry Ford quote to say the customer doesn’t know what they want. Or, rather they can, but that doesn’t mean they have any more of a clue than the customer does.<p>My point is maybe we should stop being so antagonistic to the customer.

It requires a mix of experience, intuition, technical know how, observing the landscape of existing alternatives, knowing how to anticipate technical&#x2F;economic&#x2F;sociological evolutions, etc.<p>The latter is about making sure that what you designed does what you intend it to, identifying what confuses your users, what gets in their way, etc. This is where all the classical methods of user observation&#x2F;testing&#x2F;surveys&#x2F;etc can be useful. This sounds easy and obvious, but it is anything but - i have met my fair share of designers who stick to their principles and are unwilling to budge when reality conflicts with their ideology, companies that inexplicably never fix bugs that most of their users encounter and rage about on the support forums&#x2F;social media, etc.<p>The two are very different skillsets, and it’s hard enough to be good at one, let alone both.<p>The article uses Intuit as a case study; the dynamics of how to do genuinely great work when your business involves selling an antidote to a poison you lobby for is an exercise left to the reader.</div><br/><div id="38822162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38822162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nradov</span><span>|</span><a href="#38821825">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38821860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38822162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38822162">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And yet there is still a significant global industry for breeding faster horses.

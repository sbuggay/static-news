Teletext was pretty widespread throughout Europe in the 1980s and 1990s.<p>It was typically used to transmit pages of information (news, weather, etc.) that could be viewed directly on the TV, but the BBC&#x27;s Ceefax[2] Teletext service was also used to distribute software to the BBC Micro, when equipped with the appropriate Teletext Adapter[3].<p>In a similar fashion to the Sega Channel system, the Teletext system would broadcast looped data, with popular pages (such as news and weather) being repeated frequently so they would load quickly, and less popular pages taking longer to load (or more accurately, to wait for the next time they appeared in the looped data).<p>I was interested to see that the Sega system used a bitrate of 8Mbps, which sounded pretty high for the mid-90s, but I see that Teletext had a bitrate of almost 7Mbps for PAL broadcasts, despite being roughly 15 years older!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teletext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teletext</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ceefax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ceefax</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BBC_Micro_expansion_unit#Teletext_adapter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BBC_Micro_expansion_unit#Telet...</a></div><br/><div id="42355494" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42355494" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wgx</span><span>|</span><a href="#42355321">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42355479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42355494">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42355494">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for this!

They would then send everything to a company called Foley Hi-Tech, who would create the game menu graphics&#x2F;animations and insert all the monthly content. They ended up with a ~60MB file called a &quot;game image&quot;, which was burnt to a CD and sent to a satellite uplink facility in Denver, Colorado. The CD would then be installed in the uplink game server computer, which would continuously transmit the game data in a loop over satellite. Cable headends all over the US would receive the satellite transmission and send it to cable subscribers. The data being sent in a continuous loop is how the service&#x27;s &quot;interactivity&quot; was achieved at a time when cable TV providers could only transmit data to all subscribers and couldn&#x27;t receive data (i.e. what game a given subscriber wants to download)

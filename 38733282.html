It was successful, and customers wanted the same thing but for Outlook Express. Unfortunately, OE had no plugin architecture. But Windows has Windows hooks and DLL injection. So we were able to build a macro-like system that clicked here and dragged there and did what we needed it to. The only problem was that you could see all the actions happening on the screen. It worked perfectly, but the flickering looked awful.<p>At lunch, someone joked that we just had to convince OE users not to look at the screen while our product did its thing. We all laughed, then paused. We looked around at each other and said &quot;no, that can&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>That afternoon someone coded up a routine to screenshot the entire desktop, display the screenshot full-screen, do our GUI manipulations, wait for the event loop to drain so that we knew OE had updated, and then kill the full-screen overlay. Since the overlay was a screenshot of the screen, it shouldn&#x27;t have been noticable.<p>It totally worked. The flickering was gone.

   4. Then it opened your address book and copied out entries one by one. 
   5. It couldn&#x27;t tell by any other method that it had reached the end of your address book, so if it saw the same contact several times in a row it would stop.
   6. Then it formatted your address book into a CSV for importing to Exchange, and emailed it back to you.
   7. It logged out of your account, and back into its own, and resumed waiting for an incoming email.

Now, accessibility APIs on Windows were documented, but web browsers used a bunch of additional APIs that were poorly documented. Chrome&#x27;s design was radically different than Firefox&#x27;s and IE&#x27;s, so it was a challenge to implement the APIs correctly. At first I was just trying to get it to work with completely static web pages.<p>Screen readers were reading form controls, but no matter what I did they weren&#x27;t activating any of their web-specific features in Chrome. I spent weeks carefully comparing every single API between Firefox and Chrome, making the tiniest changes until they produced identical results - but still no luck.<p>Finally, out of ideas, I thought to build Chrome but rename the executable to firefox.exe before running it. Surely, I thought, they hadn&#x27;t hard-coded the executable names of browsers.<p>But of course they had. Suddenly all of these features started working.<p>Now that I knew what to ask for, I reached out and made contact with the screen reader vendor and asked them to treat Chrome as a web browser. I learned another important lesson, that I probably shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to reach out and ask for help. It ended up being a long journey to make Chrome work well with screen readers, but I&#x27;m happy with the end result.</div><br/><div id="38742556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38742556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway914</span><span>|</span><a href="#38742526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38737625">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38742556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38742556">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is a good story :)  It makes me wonder what future Wayland protocol may enable clients&#x2F;apps to advertise themselves as screen-reader capable.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38737625" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38737625" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rented_mule</span><span>|</span><a href="#38742526">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741562">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38737625">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38737625">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">15+ years ago, I was working on indexing gigabytes of text on a mobile CPU (before smart phones caused massive investment in such CPUs). Word normalization logic (e.g., sky&#x2F;skies&#x2F;sky&#x27;s -&gt; sky) was very slow, so I used a cache, which sped it up immensely. Conceptually the cache looked like {&quot;sky&quot;: &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;skies&quot;: &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;sky&#x27;s&quot;: &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;cats&quot;: &quot;cat&quot;, ...}.<p>I needed cache eviction logic as there was only 1 MB of RAM available to the indexer, and most of that was used by the library that parsed the input format. The initial version of that logic cleared the entire cache when it hit a certain number of entries, just as a placeholder. When I got around to adding some LRU eviction logic, it became faster on our desktop simulator, but far slower on the embedded device (slower than with no word cache at all). I tried several different &quot;smart&quot; eviction strategies. All of them were faster on the desktop and slower on the device. The disconnect came down to CPU cache (not word cache) size &#x2F; strategy differences between the desktop and mobile CPUs - that was fun to diagnose!<p>We ended up shipping the &quot;dumb&quot; eviction logic because it was so much faster in practice. The eviction function was only two lines of code plus a large comment explaining all the above and saying something to the effect of &quot;yes, this looks dumb, but test speed on the target device when making it smarter.&quot;</div><br/><div id="38741369" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38741369" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dharmab</span><span>|</span><a href="#38737625">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741205">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38741369">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38741369">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Similarly, a modder recently found that unrolling loops _hurt_ performance on the N64 because of RAM bus contention: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_rzYnXEQlE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_rzYnXEQlE</a></div><br/><div id="38741720" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38741720" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pclmulqdq</span><span>|</span><a href="#38737625">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741369">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741205">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38741720">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38741720">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unrolled loops can also often hurt for the same reason on big server chips.

Hashing of word-length strings in the underlying optimized C code was extremely fast and CPU cache friendly (and came with the JVM). With the simple cache in place, indexing time was dominated by the libraries that extracted the text from the supported formats. So, in line with this Ask HN&#x27;s topic, it was good enough. And less code to maintain. And easier for engineers after me to understand. A good tradeoff overall.<p>More technical details for the curious...<p>Earlier I had done a quick trie implementation for other purposes in that code, but abandoned it. The problem is that we had to index (and search) large amounts of content in many different languages, including Chinese and Japanese with full Unicode support. This means that there is such large potential fan-out &#x2F; sparsity within the trie that you need faster lookups &#x2F; denser storage at each node in the trie (a hash map or binary search or ...). In that situation, a trie can be much slower than a single hash map with short strings as keys. Especially in a JIT-less JVM (the same code had to run server-side, where native extensions weren&#x27;t allowed). If we were only dealing with ASCII, then maybe. And there would also be more complexity to maintain for decades (you can still buy newer versions of the device today that are running the same indexing and search code).<p>All those languages were also the reason that normalization needed caching. In v1, we were English only. I hand rolled a &quot;good enough&quot; normalizer that was simple &#x2F; fast enough to not need caching. In v2 we went international as described above. I wasn&#x27;t capable of hand rolling anything beyond English. So we brought in Lucene&#x27;s tokenizers&#x2F;stemmers (including for English, which was much more accurate than mine). Many of the stemmers were written in Snowball and the resulting Java code was very slow on the device.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38742046" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38742046" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Exoristos</span><span>|</span><a href="#38737625">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741731">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38742147">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741562">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38742046">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38742046">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; since you can check again for the actual matches.<p>Can you explain this?</div><br/><div id="38742126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38742126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">o11c</span><span>|</span><a href="#38737625">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38742046">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741562">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38742126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38742126">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">An aggressive stemmer might stem both &quot;generic&quot; and &quot;general&quot; to &quot;gener&quot;.<p>Then if your query is &quot;what documents contain &#x27;generic&#x27;?&quot;, you look in the index for &quot;gener&quot; and then open each of those documents and check if it <i>actually</i> has &quot;generic&quot; using a stricter stemmer (that accepts generic{,s}, genericness{,es}, genericit{y,ies}, generically ... this is a bit of a bad example since they all have the prefix directly).

We had a few remote embedded devices that did work and sent data back to the mothership over the internet. Their firmware could be remotely updated, but we were always very careful.<p>Well one day a mistake was finally made. Some of the devices went into a sort of loop. Theyâd start running the important process, something would go wrong, and theyâd just retry every few minutes.<p>We caught the issue almost instantly since we were watching the deploy, and were able to stop updates before any other devices picked it up. But those that already got it were down.<p>We could ask the devices to send us the output of a command remotely, but it was too limited to be able to send back an error log. We didnât have time to send back like 255 characters at a time or whatever, we needed to get it fixed ASAP.<p>And thatâs when the genius stupid hack was suggested. While we couldnât send up a full log file, we could certainly send up something the length of a URL. So what if we sent down a little command to stick the log on PasteBin and send up the URL to us?<p>Worked like a charm. We could identify what was going wrong and fix it in just a few minutes. After some quick (but VERY thorough) testing everything was fixed.</div><br/><div id="38741596" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38741596" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kr0bat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38741447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741862">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38741596">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38741596">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How you could have enough control over the machine to reroute the error log to (what I assume was) a Pastebin api, while also lacking access to any of the files on the machine?

We couldnât SSH in, which is too bad this would all be trivial. We had no direct access to the boxes, they were often behind firewalls. In fact that was the suggested placement for security reasons. They werenât full servers, just little embedded things.<p>We had a little HTTP API that it was always talking to. It would call the API to send data back to us or just check in regularly, and we would return to it a little bit of status stuff like the current time to keep clocks in sync, and a list of which âcommandsâ they need to run.<p>Mostly the commands were things like âyour calibration data is out of data, pull an updateâ or âa firmware update is availableâ.<p>But one of them let us run arbitrary shell commands. The system was very limited. I wasnât a developer directly on the project but I think it was just our custom software plus busy box and a handful of other things our normal shell scripts used. I assume it had been added after some previous incident.<p>I believe the basic idea was that during troubleshooting you could tell a box to return the output of âcat &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.confâ or something else that we hadnât preplanned for without having to send someone into the field. But since it was only for small things like that it couldnât return a full file.<p>Luckily one of the commands was either curl or wget. So we could send down âcurl -whatever &#x2F;log&#x2F;path <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin&#x2F;uploadâ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin&#x2F;uploadâ</a> or whatever it was. I donât remember if we signed up for a pastebin account so we knew where it would show up or if we had it return URL to us in the output of the curl command.<p>This suggestion was literally a joke. We were all beating our heads against the wall trying to help and someone just said âwhy donât we just stick it on pastebinâ out of frustration, and the developer on the project realized we had what we needed to do that and it would work.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38742493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38742493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zimpenfish</span><span>|</span><a href="#38741447">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741596">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741719">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38742493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38742493">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was doing some proxy soak testing for a company once where we had to run the tests from the server room but there was no non-proxy connectivity from that room to where we were monitoring the tests.

Since thereâs no longer a concrete âthingâ called a file, you can organize them however you want and with whatever âmetadataâ you want by having a dict with the metadata you want and some convention like :file as the key that points to the body. Arbitrary indexes too; any number of data structures could all share a reference to the same variable.<p>Simple databases are just made up of collections of objects. Foreign key constraints? Just make the instance variable type a non-nullable type. Indexes? Lists of tuples that point to the objects. More complex databases and queries can provide a set of functions as an API. You can write queries in SQL or you can just provide a map&#x2F;filter&#x2F;reduce function with the predicate written in normal code. Graph databases too: you can just run Dijkstraâs algorithm or TSP or whatever directly on a rich persistent data structure.<p>Thanks for the neat idea to riff on. I like it!

It had very limited actual functionality to get data from the API, whereas most data was simply to be displayed on user interface elements. We needed a piece of data, programmatically to do something with, that was only available via a user interface element. So I wrote and trained a vision application that would OCR the numeric indicator by taking a programmatic screenshot of the user interface element and then return the value. So at the top level, one simply made a function call that returned a number, but below, it was doing the UI display (hidden), screenshotting a region of the hidden window, OCRing it, and then returning the number.<p>You&#x27;d be surprised at the hacks required when interacting with scientific instrumentation.

(So no server-side node.js or such.)<p>It was a project scheduled for 2-3 months, for a large corporation. The customer wanted a button that a user would click in the old system, requesting a record to be copied over to the new system (Dynamics CRM). 
Since the systems would be used in parallel for a time, it could be done repeatedly, with later clicks of the button sending updates to the new system.<p>I designed it to run on an integration server in a dedicated WS, nothing extraordinary. But 3 days before the scheduled end of the project, it became clear that the customer simply will not have the server to run the WS on. They were incapable of provisioning it and configuring the network.<p>So I came up with a silly solution: hey, the user will already be logged in to both systems, so let&#x27;s do it in their browser. 
The user clicked the button in the old system, which invoked a javascript that prepared the data to migrate into a payload (data -&gt; JSON -&gt; Base64 -&gt; URL escape) and GET-ed it in a URL parameter onto a &#x27;New Record&#x27; creation form into the new system. That entire record type was just my shim; when its form loaded, it woke another javascript up, which triggered a Save, which triggered a server-side plugin that decoded and parsed the data, which then processed them, triggering like 30 other plugins that were already there - some of them sending data on into a different system.<p>I coded this over the weekend and handed it in, with the caveat that since it has to be a GET request, it simply will not work if the data payload exceeds the maximum URL length allowed by the server, ha ha.  
You will not be surprised to learn the payload contained large HTMLs from rich text editors, so it did happen a few times. 
But it ran successfully for over a year until the old system eventually was fully deprecated.<p>(Shout out to my boss, who was grateful for the solution and automatically offered to pay for the overtime.)</div><br/><div id="38741505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38741505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MBCook</span><span>|</span><a href="#38739007">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38733412">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38741505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38741505">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thatâs horrible.

These machines were mostly in use for serving Google&#x27;s web index, so almost the entire RAM was devoted to index data; the indexserver processes were designed to be robust against hardware failure, and if they noticed any kind of corruption they&#x27;d dump and reload their data.  We noticed that they were dumping&#x2F;reloading massively more often than they&#x27;d expect.<p>Eventually the cause was narrowed down to that, randomly when the machine was stressed, the second half (actually, the final 2052 bytes) of some physical page in memory would get zeroed out.  This wasn&#x27;t great for the indexservers but they survived due to the defensive way that they accessed their data.  But when we tried to use these new machines for Gmail, it was disastrous - random zeroing of general process code&#x2F;data or even kernel data meant things were crashing hard.<p>We noticed from the kernel panic dumps (Google had a feature that sent kernel panics over the network to a central collector, which got a lot of use around this time) that a small number of pages were showing up in crash dump registers far more often than would statistically be expected.  This suggested that the zeroing wasn&#x27;t completely random.  So we added a list of &quot;bad pages&quot; that would be forcefully removed from the kernel&#x27;s allocator at boot time, so those pages would never be allocated for the kernel or any process.  Any time we saw more than a few instances of some page address in a kernel panic dump, we added it to the list for the next kernel build.  Like magic, this dropped the rate of crashes down into the noise level.<p>The root cause of the problem was never really determined (probably some kind of chipset bug) and those machines are long obsolete now.  But it was somehow discovered that if you reset the machine via poking some register in the northbridge rather than via the normal reset mechanism, the problem went away entirely.  So for years the Google bootup scripts included a check for this kind of CPU&#x2F;chipset, followed by a check of how the last reset had been performed (via a marker file) and if it wasn&#x27;t the special hard reset, adding the marker file and poking the northbridge to reset again.  These machines took far far longer than any other machines in the fleet to reboot due to these extra checks and the double reboot, but it worked.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38742052" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38742052" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">r0ze-at-hn</span><span>|</span><a href="#38742020">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38741701">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38742052">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38742052">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was younger I learned that Sed was turing complete.

The system would generate an XML file in a directory that was shared out via Samba.  A VB6 program watched that directory for these XML files to appear, when one appeared it would figure out what the relevant template was, use COM automation to tell MS Word to load the template, fill in the template fields, save it to that client&#x27;s folder on the file server, then print (on the user&#x27;s selected printer in the green-screen system) two copies (one for the paper file, one to mail) and an envelope.<p>There were a bunch of weird word processing practices that made it slightly worse than it already sounds.  Each letter that was sent out was actually made of a letterhead (one for each location we operated) and a body with the standard text for various letters we sent.  The body would sometimes contain links to other documents (e.g., forms we were requesting someone to fill out), the program would follow these links and print those documents too, but only one copy as we didn&#x27;t need a bunch of blank forms on the paper file.<p>There was also an Access database used by this VB6 program to maintain various bits of configuration data - mappings of document codes to filenames, mappings of green-screen printer names to Windows printer names, etc.  Access gets a bad rap, but it made maintaining that configuration data a breeze.<p>It was horrific, but it saved everyone an incredible amount of time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38735259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38735259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DamnInteresting</span><span>|</span><a href="#38741701">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38733701">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38735259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38735259">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Around 16 years ago, Wordpress security was just not up to snuff yet, and my popular Wordpress-based site kept getting hacked by pharmaceutical spammers and the like.

I love seeing people just come up with solutions however inelegant. I do this myself: get something working and then circle back to make it more maintainable etc.<p>While as a new DBA for Microsoft SQL server on a team of very seasoned DBAs with decades of experience each I wrote a small Python script to fix a replication bug that MS refused to fix.<p>The bug iirc was something related to initial snapshot settings such that by default a setting was set to off so replication would fail. They would normally go and edit this file manually when this happened. When it really blew up it could be editing this file in tens of locations! It was just something they had consigned themselves to doing since it happened just infrequently enough for them not to invest time to fixing but when it did happen it could take an hour or so to do and yeah my noob self thought thatâs far too tedious I am
not doing that.<p>The bug really should have been fixed by MS and the flag should have been set to on and my script would just find the relavent unc share and text file and basically do a find and replace of that line and toggled the flag. And then replication would work again. I could point the script to a server and it would figure out the path and do the work. All I then had to do was enumerate the servers that were affected and it was fixed in no time.<p>This fix was so popular when I showed it internally that they asked me to turn it into a GUI application. It was awesome. I learned a bit of C# and from what I heard a few years back my little tool was still in USE!

One of the machines built blocks of paper that were each laser cut and laminated to one another. The company that made it went out of business and there wasnât any software support. Many of the supported printers had tools to email when various events happened and we used that to page employees to come in and remove finished prints or whatever needed to be done.<p>This machine didnât have that capability nor any obvious extension points. I ended up writing a VB app that would pill the serial port, which the machine used to talk to the control system, and if the serial port was busy and then became free, send an email. Email was sent by writing a very simple SNMP client.<p>That program ended up working for another, lower cost 3D printer that we acquired later as well.<p>I ended up extending for a 3á´¿á´° printer to tail its log and look for a message it emitted when prints finished.<p>We share it with a few places and got one of the printer companies to add email support later.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

It was similar in that I couldn’t continue to go full tilt everyday. In my mind all my success was based on that: working all the time. Turns out I was wrong; I still make a living but am much more prudent about what I spend time on.<p>Anyway. After reading all the philosophical quotes etc I felt bad when you ended with this:<p>&gt;&gt; Despite my injury, I still try to maintain a bulletproof growth mindset. I constantly ask myself why I shouldn&#x27;t make more money every month.<p>My friend, even if there is anything to Carol Dweck (severe criticism is warranted there), this is the servant mindset that you just wrote about. Make more money for what? You can’t take it with you when you die and it will not make you happy in ill health.<p>Oh and you’re right about there not being any moral epiphany or reward in ill health. It just sucks. Feeling good is the opposite: it’s just good. There is nothing else.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40245549" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40245549" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vkazanov</span><span>|</span><a href="#40241507">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40245531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40245549">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40245549">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Had this experience about 6-8 years ago, when I was 30ish. You know, a bunch of programming hobbies + a programming job + active writing as a hobby + not enough cardio activity.<p>It all started with a mild discomformt. Then the discomfort becomes something like mild but constant pain in fingers, hands, arm joints where the nerves are. Not pain-pain but unpleasant sensation. Then my fingertips went numb. And it was getting worse with every week.<p>My company had a great insurance so I went through a bunch of doctors. What they said was &quot;all relatively fine FOR NOW, nerve microtraumas accumulate but don&#x27;t get enough time to restore&quot;.<p>In the meantime I couldn&#x27;t do anything that involved touching a keyboard or a screen. A trivial phone call was a problem.<p>It took a while but I had to reassess my relationship with computers and health.<p>1. I started doing cardio. Walk a lot. 10k+ steps a day integrated into my routine. Kettlebells and running. Weightlifting. Weight control. The point is to increase blood flow everywhere and let the body fix itself.
2. Less stupid typing, more smart typing.
3. No mechanically clicking keyboards and mice. That&#x27;s is a nerve hit 1000s right there times a day.<p>It didn&#x27;t happen over a month, or even a year. The habit refresh took a long time to develop, years.<p>But I have my hands back! As a side effect I am in a good shape now, definitely better than in my early 30s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40245531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40245531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saos</span><span>|</span><a href="#40245549">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40233914">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40245531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40245531">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s not clear from the article.

What about the guys who had their limbs amputated? They even can&#x27;t swim anymore, don&#x27;t even talk about cooking or putting on trousers (or self love..)<p>It&#x27;s a drama. Yes. I feel for you. I also feel&#x2F;see a lot of self pityriasis in your thinking&#x2F;text, like paying lots of attention to own condition and whining about.. I&#x27;m in a severe condition by myself, but I always have thought of this &quot;this shit. But others got more shit to bare and have a ticking clock over them&quot;<p>So, keep up the sanity. Live with your condition. Try to find a relief. Adapt to the new situation - what you already did. Write less text that trend to provoke others feeling pity for you. Or in my words: my problem is my condition and it&#x27;s my condition that it won&#x27;t become your problem.<p>Peace.

How much of them are posting on a site what they are suffering? I don&#x27;t know one in my aroundings. I too, do not post anything blog wise.

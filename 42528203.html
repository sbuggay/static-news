These AI changes reversed the accepted versions of papers that had already been properly formatted by the handling editors.

I talk to fellow researchers and students plenty, read abstracts and I am senior enough to sniff out rubbish rather quickly, etc. If you want to have an amazing, leading, free&#x2F;open journal you can look at say the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics [1].

AAAI is not, but the quality of what is presented at AAAI tends to be worse than the open ones anyway and as I said earlier, no one of note publishes in closed journals other than Google DeepMind.

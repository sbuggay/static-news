Could also live anywhere for a few years.<p>OTOH, if I had F.U. money, I would do those things and more. I might hire people to do them. There are 5 to 10 apps I&#x27;d like to see exist. Would be happy to pay some people to make them and make them open source, if I had FU money. Would love to start a tech-interactive-art museum the size of at least most major museums in big cities. Would consider funding startups.<p>I have one friend, x-coworker, that picked a different path than me and made lots of $$$ (no idea how much). But, they invest in startups. Goal is to invest $1 million a year. They visit startups and pitch events once or twice a month.  They also have a personal project.  Otherwise they travel with their S.O. and visit their adult kids around the world.</div><br/><div id="42583478" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42583478" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway2037</span><span>|</span><a href="#42580321">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42581113">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42581581">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42583478">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42583478">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>    &gt; Would love to start a tech-interactive-art museum

At first they get hooked on the drug of high social status, but then they learn to see through the flattery and realize that nothing has truly changed, and they’re just as miserable as before. It tends to take about two years, in my observation, for the “new life energy” to wear off. Money teaches you that there isn’t some “better” society to aspire to. The people “up there” aren’t the supervillains Redditers imagine billionaires to be, but they’re not better either.<p>My daughter is autistic and when she started to learn how to read social cues she realized that her so-called friends didn’t actually like her, which I suspected myself but never had the chutzpah to say, and it made her angry.

What I’ve found is that you need to replace money&#x2F;salary&#x2F;financial success optimisation (assuming you spent a lot of your life and energy to this point focused on these, much like I did) with something else totally unconnected with being measured in that way. For me, I am focused on proving myself as a guitarist in the local jazz and blues scene. These people have no idea how much money I have and wouldn’t give a shit if they did (I didn’t really change my lifestyle after getting lucky so it’s not obvious). So it’s an area I can be creative, grow, and still feel like I’m doing something. At the same time I’m doing part time consulting, mainly for people I worked with in the past who have started companies, just to scratch the tech itch. So far so good but I can’t say yet if it will stick. Maybe for you it’s art, music, going and getting another unrelated degree, or something along those lines? If you have more money than you know what to do with, fundraising and supporting good causes can be really rewarding. Both in terms of giving back something to your local community, and having really nice social elements to it.<p>One big piece of advice I have is to try to avoid letting others in your social network know exactly how successful you’ve been.

One guy bought a nightclub, but it loses money year after year.</div><br/><div id="42582525" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42582525" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">psanford</span><span>|</span><a href="#42581936">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42582556">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42582525">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42582525">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Most people who make a lot of money all at once blow it within seven years<p>This is a commonly recited myth about lottery winners[1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnjennings&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;debunking-the-myth-the-surprising-truth-about-lottery-winners-and-life-satisfaction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnjennings&#x2F;2023&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;debunki...</a></div><br/><div id="42582575" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42582575" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teractiveodular</span><span>|</span><a href="#42581936">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42582525">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42582556">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42582575">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42582575">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a legendary Reddit comment that lays out the many, many other ways winning the lottery (or, more importantly, letting people know you won the lottery) is bad for you.

The idea that &quot;for profit&quot; organizations have some builtin magic trick that means that they improve and save money in ways that other sorts of organizations cannot is just demonstrably untrue.<p>What is true, of course, is that no matter what the type of organization, if there are people who care about and are empowered to meaningfully tackle waste and inefficiency, then things can improve. And this happens, both in government and non-governmental organizations. You don&#x27;t hear about it much, for broadly the same reason you don&#x27;t hear about for-profit organizations wasting money: it just isn&#x27;t news.<p>The second assumption that I think you&#x27;re making is that &quot;wasteful outcomes&quot; are by definition a bad thing. The problem is that government often is tasked with tackling problems where wasteful outcomes are a more or less builtin part of the way things get done, and we accept that (sometimes) because the <i>full cost</i> (not just financial cost) of trying to reduce waste is higher than the waste itself. A typical example: yes, there&#x27;s no doubt that some government benefits go to people who are not eligible for them. However, the task of identifying all those people has many costs, both direct and indirect. The whole system becomes massively more invasive of everyone&#x27;s lives when one of its prime directives is &quot;make sure that not one cent goes to some not entitled to it&quot;. So most societies accept that there will be a level of waste, which is made up for by the benefits of treating things as if they are closer to a universal benefit.<p>There are plenty of other examples of this in different domains where the government operates.</div><br/><div id="42581842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42581842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s1artibartfast</span><span>|</span><a href="#42580494">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42581415">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42581947">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42581842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42581842">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;This fails to explain why private corporations (which presumably have from one to millions of stakeholders that care about cost saving) would waste millions of dollars.<p>Of course it fails to explain something was wasnt talking about.

I interpret that metaphorically.<p>I agree that there&#x27;s a parallel between what Jesus meant and your comment—in both cases, wealth is dangerous because it distracts from what&#x27;s important. To my understanding, Jesus meant that one&#x27;s heart will be focused on money rather than wanting to follow God. And, like you said, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy to be distracted by material success (money, degrees, fame, etc.). But, none of these things will follow us to the grave. IMO this sort of tunnel vision is really pernicious, because it&#x27;s so, so easy to fall into.<p>If you&#x27;ll allow a personal rant: I recently heard someone say that failure is—somewhat paradoxically—a crucial part of finding happiness, because it loosens our grip on things that are ultimately unimportant. I&#x27;ve been thinking about all this a lot recently myself. Last year I hit a bump in the road w.r.t. my career, due to factors outside of my control. So, for the first time, I was suddenly failing my subconscious goal to climb the ladder of achievement. I started feeling adrift and demotivated, and the obvious solutions (therapy, medication, more regular exercise) didn&#x27;t help.<p>It eventually forced me to really sit down and take a hard look at my priorities in life. Speaking concretely, this meant 1) accepting that I might not get what I had wanted out of my career, and because I&#x27;m a Christian, 2) focusing instead on how I can serve God every day (love others more, be much more open about my faith, volunteer at church and elsewhere, etc.). That&#x27;s much easier said than done, of course, but I&#x27;ve just gotta take the baby steps that I can and trust God with the rest.<p>It&#x27;s only been a few months since I came to this conclusion, but I feel like it&#x27;s changed my life.

The trick is being able to mold the idea into what people actually want it to be, and find some model that lets you and them split the value, so the work can continue. The same is true in any kind of political or social activity. Ideas are almost worthless.<p>As in software, people who are capable of actually executing on their ideas for making the world better are almost always also capable of getting the funding they need, one way or another.

Definitely.<p>The post I was responding to was advocating for giving money to people with an idea for how to make the world better who would otherwise never be able to do it.<p>The existence of such people is almost a myth.<p>They do exist, but they&#x27;re impossible to find in the haystack of people who are guaranteed to fail at executing their idea.

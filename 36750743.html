The later Linear B system encodes archaic Greek, and is very similar to Linear A in glyph form.  The Minoan language written with Linear A is probably unrelated to any other language.<p>Phonetic values are necessarily from Linear B or otherwise guesses - it&#x27;s very likely there was a great deal of overlap, that the symbol representing, for example, the syllable &quot;ni&quot; in Greek, represented a syllable that sounded a lot like &quot;ni&quot; in Minoan.  (Linear B is quite unsuited to writing Greek sounds, an indicator that it was borrowed from a very different language.)  But since the language of Linear A remains undeciphered, that is really just an educated guess at best.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36751263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36751263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OfSanguineFire</span><span>|</span><a href="#36751331">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36754716">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36751263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36751263">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Work by amateurs on Linear A does not have a good track record.

A basically crackpot theory that was immediately debunked that Linear B was Etruscan. Then Ventris worked hard to become an insider.<p>Many key observations for the decoding were done by someone else, a classicist, Alice Kober, right before her untimely death. She worked for 20 years on Linear B and put down all of the foundations. The fact that Linear B has grammatical roots and suffixes, the language is inflected, has case, gender, etc. Kober was one of the first people to work systematically finding patterns and documenting her methods. The work Ventirs did would have been impossible without Kober&#x27;s methods: extending her work is what worked and gave Ventris his main idea.<p>Ventris briefly worked with Kober. It didn&#x27;t go well. But over time Ventris came to know the key players and to be accepted in the inner circle. One of these players, Emmett Bennett, gave him what Kober did not have: the Pylos tablets. By the time they were published she had died.<p>Ventris extended Kober&#x27;s work to the Pylos tablets. Her work focused on systematically analyzing groups of characters. When he looked at the results, he made his first critical observation: some groups were unique to the Knossos tablets and others were unique to the Pylos tablets. What if these are place names?<p>There aren&#x27;t that many places to be had on Knossos and he knew the Greek names. So he looked for possible combinations and used them to guide the decoding. He used Kober&#x27;s work and the place names, along with help from at least Bennett, to build a rough mapping from some signs to sound. And then he made his second critical observation: what if Linear B is Greek? Since the Greek names for places seemed to appear.<p>Then he could try to decode word after word. And along the way he made his third critical observation: many Myceanean scribes were incredibly sloppy spellers. We can even tell now that some were much better than others, but everything is very messy because even the basic rules of spelling weren&#x27;t agreed on yet. Not only were characters missing, but a single character could be one of 30+ different syllables at times. Bare statistical methods alone often resulted in a mess because of this.<p>Only small parts of the text could potentially be decoded at this point. None of the classicists that Ventris normally talked to were convinced.<p>That&#x27;s when John Chadwick, a linguist, heard about Ventris and tried his idea out. Chadwick was an expert in very old Greek, 1000 years older than Plato. Chadwick was quickly convinced by Ventris because while the decodings were very poor for someone who knew classical Greek, they made a lot more sense to him. They worked together for several years to fix up the decoding.<p>An architect did contribute the main idea for the decoding, but an architect that was a connected insider, with a background in Greek and Latin, who had published in the area before, knowledgeable in all of the latest methods, with access to privileged information, in conversation with the experts.<p>The way you put it, it sounds like some random architect somewhere looked at Linear B, worked hard on their own, and came up with the answer. That&#x27;s not even remotely true.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36752229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36752229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thaumasiotes</span><span>|</span><a href="#36751263">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36751596">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36753943">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36751614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36752229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36752229">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is not clear why his decipherment is accepted as meaningful.

It has also been widely rejected by scholars of eminence, in varying degrees.<p>&gt; These Ventrisian rules enable bits of a curious sort of Greek to be got out of Lin[ear] B texts; but experiments have shown that bits of English or Latin or other tongues, when spelt out in syllables according to the Ventrisian system, are capable often of yielding bits of Greek just as plausible as anything in the Ventris-Chadwick <i>Documents</i> volume.

The cost of finding them enters a spiral of diminishing returns, but that <i>may</i> be remedied at some point.<p>But, even so, there is no guarantee that even with all surving artefacts uncovered we would be able to reconstruct the language.<p>Pressumably that &quot;edge of knowledgeable history&quot; calculus plays across many regions and sometimes ignorance is annoyingly &quot;close&quot; to the modern era. Even long after the invention of writing the vast majority of human culture was not recorded and is essentially lost.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36755579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36755579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davedx</span><span>|</span><a href="#36754716">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36753370">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36755579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36755579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Via this post I found the book &quot;The Riddle of the Labyrinth&quot; about the people who deciphered Linear B.

He said that the Mi&#x27;Kmaq had an old writing system. I checked into it and it predates any contact with Europeans and is one of the very few writing systems by native peoples here.

Systems that can represent the full range of spoken expression are labeled &quot;true&quot; or &quot;full&quot; writing.<p>This had the convenient side effect of neatly classifying all the American writing systems as protowriting in the early 20th century, as well as some more controversial examples like Chinese. Some of those have since been walked back (e.g. Mayan), but most remain in that limbo. We have a somewhat better understanding today that there was a huge variety of visual communication systems across the Americas prior to European contact, but properly redefining the term &quot;writing&quot; to include them is a slow, ongoing process.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36751667" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36751667" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shaftoe444</span><span>|</span><a href="#36753370">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36751861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36751667">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36751667">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very weird to see this, I went to an exhibition about Knossos in Oxford only today.<p>Good episode here that covers a bit about the language and translation efforts.

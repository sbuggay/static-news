It touches on it briefly, but I&#x27;ve mostly come to believe that it is in general bad for companies to become extremely large.  It&#x27;s not just an issue of content moderation.<p>One reason that the article does touch on is the detachment from support.  Large companies no longer need to care about the individual consumer, so they stop doing so.  A sort of corollary for this is the tendency for large companies to shift from &quot;doing what they do&quot; to protecting their market position.  That means spending more time on non-core activities, and in some cases even trying to expand into totally unrelated markets (as seen with large conglomerates).<p>It is only when we talk about &quot;economics&quot; in the sense of money-making for an individual company that &quot;economies of scale&quot; are a good thing.  In the sense of benefit to the overall economy, to the society in which that economy sits, or to humanity in general, virtually all economies of scale are actually harmful.<p>I think we should view economies of scale like the rampant growth of grass or weeds: they are natural phenomena, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re good, and in fact for most practical purposes they need to be actively opposed.  It&#x27;s natural for grass to grow, and if it doesn&#x27;t, it may indicate a problem, but you should still cut the grass every so often.  Likewise it is natural for companies to grow, but big companies should regularly be broken up simply because they have become big.</div><br/><div id="39426870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39426870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jakewins</span><span>|</span><a href="#39426815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39426494">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39426870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39426870">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In the sense of benefit to the overall economy, to the society in which that economy sits, or to humanity in general, virtually all economies of scale are actually harmful<p>You had me until here.<p>Economies of scale in <i>commodities</i> is the thing that makes it so we don’t have to do sustenance farming and everyone gets to have sewn clothes on :)<p>There’s truth in both sides there - we want nail production to not be done by hand, but also real humans with power to change things to answer the phone when we call support.</div><br/><div id="39427120" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39427120" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BrenBarn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39426815">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39426870">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39426963">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39427120">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39427120">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess I forgot to repeat the part about &quot;extremely large&quot; there.

Like, yes, we want nails to be made in some efficient way, but that&#x27;s not what I mean by &quot;economies of scale&quot;.  What I&#x27;m talking about is the size of the companies involved.  If there are 10 factories making nails, I&#x27;d rather have them be run by 10 different companies than one.  And you might be able to convince me that 9 or 8 or even 5 companies is reasonable, but not one or two.<p>The <i>process</i> that the companies use can involve something that you might call an &quot;economy of scale&quot; in the sense that you need to be making X number of nails before it becomes feasible to shift from artisans to factories.

If you measure in number of arrests you aren&#x27;t solving the problems. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any good metric to measure that.<p>To take an analogy I&#x27;ll mention the drug war. The main target was always low level drug dealers and users. They&#x27;re easy to arrest and easy to say you&#x27;re doing something. But they are fairly inconsequential to the business of selling drugs and thus the availability on the streets. But it&#x27;s orders of magnitude harder to go after the root of the problem. I don&#x27;t want to detract this conversation with the other aspects or conspiracies (real or contrived), but just focus on the incentive structures. I think the same is here. Blizzard gets no short term reward for reporting fraudulent activity. It&#x27;s hard to know if they get long term. But at the end of the day it would be the right thing to do.<p>That&#x27;s what matters. Doing the right thing. Move fast and break things it&#x27;s a great strategy. But it can&#x27;t be used in isolation. If it is you&#x27;re left with a trail of destruction which never gets cleaned up. It&#x27;s hard to quantify objectives and so every objective function is misaligned. You need to rely on humans to see through that and correct the course as best they can. You need both the people pushing to move fast and the people pushing to slow down and repair. There&#x27;s a harmony in that competition.

So, it was good that initially all that capital flowed to him, because he was using it to move society forward (at least in this regard), and it was also good to see that capital flow away on its own, because it was <i>needed</i> elsewhere.<p>I would also point out that the centralization of companies into todays megacorps is influenced by many factors, economies of scale may be one, but so are intellectual property laws (we really dont need them!). In fact, I would venture a guess that most regulation is written by the companies that are being regulated, that keeps competition at bay, and they wont regulate themselves downwards in the food chain. Finally, I would say the centralization really took place during WWI&#x2F;WW2, it was convenient for the government to shout orders at a whole 3 people to build tanks instead of automobiles; this centralization is a strategic goal of the united states government, and enacting it through secret deals (rather than law) is a preferable method to preserve state secrecy.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39425257" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39425257" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pixl97</span><span>|</span><a href="#39425147">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39425422">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39425316">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39425257">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39425257">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Otherwise summed up as &quot;Monocultures suck&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="39425316" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39425316" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">graemep</span><span>|</span><a href="#39425147">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39425257">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39426068">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39425316">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39425316">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is true in any market, not just software.

A key concept from the book is &quot;legibility&quot;, what a state can see, and how this distorts what states do. One could easily write a highly analogous book, Seeing like a Tech Company about what&#x27;s illegible to companies that scale up, at least as companies are run today. A simple example of this is that, in many video games, including ones made by game studios that are part of a $3T company, it&#x27;s easy to get someone suspended or banned by having a bunch of people report the account for bad behavior. What&#x27;s legible to the game company is the rate of reports and what&#x27;s not legible is the player&#x27;s actual behavior (it could be legible, but the company chooses not to have enough people or skilled enough people examine actual behavior); and many people have reported similar bannings with social media companies. When it comes to things like anti-fraud systems, what&#x27;s legible to the company tends to be fairly illegible to humans, even humans working on the anti-fraud systems themselves.<p>I think legibility is one aspect of it, but I think another could very well be empathy. If you want to support a user who has a problem, then you have to <i>want</i> to help them and follow through. If you want to make a customer whole after they lost money on your platform, then you <i>want</i> to pay them back and follow through. If you want to stop your platform to be a tool used to disseminate hate, then you <i>want</i> that outcome and move heaven and earth to make it happen. You have to want to see the problems and you have to want to follow through and fix them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39425467" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39425467" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kmeisthax</span><span>|</span><a href="#39425495">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39425518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39425467">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39425467">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;By comparison, on lobste.rs, I&#x27;ve never seen a scam like this and Peter Bhat Harkins, the head mod says that they&#x27;ve never had one that he knows of.

Politicians don&#x27;t mean moderation as in everyone is being civil with each other or garbage results. That isn&#x27;t a political issue. They mean things like supporting the local censorship regime which is usually country-specific. So from a <i>political</i> perspective, more centralisation is the only way to successfully implement moderation. Because moderation doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;behave to community standards&quot; - it means &quot;comply with politician&#x27;s standards&quot;. Ie, moderating what people can say as part of their legal and political engagement with society.<p>I recall when Australia had a suppression order about Cardinal Pell, high ranking official in the Catholic church who was convicted of various sex offences. And in fairness the case was a political football so the order was reasonable. It was eventually overturned but reputational damage was done because, unfortunately for the courts, there are too many foreign news organisations so the block failed miserably and it was major news in Australia without any official Australian news sources covering it.<p>It would be relatively easy to enforce that sort of block if the major foreign distributors were just Facebook or YouTube.

But in short, our experience has been that it has proven to be a much much better platform than React Native for a small but very capable team that wants to build a high quality mobile app.<p>I should mention that the upstream Flutter project is awesome: it&#x27;s been an absolute pleasure that when we find significant problems with the platform for our use case, like the Android scroll physics not feeling native, we have been able to contribute a series of pull requests to fix the issue for everyone.

I remember using it a few years ago until they wouldn&#x27;t let me back up the whole site because it would compromise the security of my users&#x27; messages. Sure, that was true, and I could read the messages of the whole office if I did that. But someone has to be the one who can do it and doesn&#x27;t. I have been that person in my office for years, and I have never read an email that was not addressed to me, and I have no intention of doing so in the future. Anyway, those are my principles, and if you don&#x27;t like them, I&#x27;ve got others. In any case, people in the office would be a lot safer depending on my behaviour than on the behaviour of who knows who. To this day, there are colleagues who ask me to check that they haven&#x27;t received a message with (for example) the following error: hharris@ to harris@. Migadu has a catch-all function, but I don&#x27;t use it. Life is hard enough dealing with my weaknesses, I just hope other people know how to deal with theirs and that&#x27;s it.

Monal for example rate-limits connections which leads to no push notifications for a while.<p>It&#x27;s not unthinkable that they will either fold and follow the current trend or stop offering the service altogether, if it really does cost.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38660693" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660693" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wmf</span><span>|</span><a href="#38659976">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660638">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661460">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38659753">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660693">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660693">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you running the infrastructure?

If you&#x27;re using a proprietary product (including the paid&#x2F;proprietary versions of open core products that market themselves as open source), the vendor has a huge amount of power to move a feature you need to their Enterprise plan that costs 5x as much, and if they do that, you&#x27;re stuck either running an old version (which will accumulate serious known security vulnerabilities), upgrading and dealing with the changes, or migrating to an alternative, which in situations where the product has all your data in it, can easily cost far more in than the product itself.<p>I can&#x27;t say I have all the answers for how commercial open source software should work. I can tell you that open core is a much easier business model.<p>The hope is that people do care about the very significant benefits that come with using well-engineered, no tricks, 100% open source software, and that businesses that are relying on open-source software are willing to pay for the services and support that they need to succeed with it.

While the only Zulip feature that can&#x27;t work without purchasing a plan (or doing a huge amount of work to publish your own mobile apps) is mobile push notifications for businesses with 10+ users, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zulip.com&#x2F;plans&#x2F;#self-hosted" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zulip.com&#x2F;plans&#x2F;#self-hosted</a> details dozens of features for which Zulip Business includes expert support.<p>Zulip is 100% open source. In open core products, those specific features just don&#x27;t exist at all in the open source version. For example, Mattermost requires the proprietary Mattermost Professional [1] at $10&#x2F;user&#x2F;month if you want to use SSO, LDAP sync, user groups, read receipts, etc.<p>(Note also that $10&#x2F;user&#x2F;month is the minimum price at which Mattermost offers push notifications &quot;for use in production environments&quot; [2].)<p>If you compare Zulip&#x27;s pricing options to Mattermost&#x27;s, our offering is substantially more generous. 
It would be even if we went open core and moved a few dozen features of Zulip to a proprietary version. But we&#x27;re not going to do that: we really do care about being an 100% open source project.<p>If you instead compare Zulip Business to using Zulip for your business&#x27;s mission-critical communications between paid team members without paying for something, I think that&#x27;s the wrong question. Skilled humans&#x27; time is incredibly valuable, and people spend a LOT of time in team chat tools. It is rational for businesses to pay a tiny fraction of the fully-loaded cost of their employees for the insurance that comes with support and mobile push notifications for their main collaboration tool.<p>(If you&#x27;re using Zulip for something other than a server full of paid employees and contractors, see the Community plan and discounts for other use cases).<p>Finally, on the topic of cost to us: Supporting a business that is self-hosting complex, mission-critical software like Zulip is more expensive for us than having that business using Zulip Cloud. Hosting is cheap compared to humans who can debug anything, and there are big economies of scales in terms of human time for managing a large multi-tenant cloud installation.<p>Helping thousands of different people with varied skill levels self-hosted your application successfully is not cheap, even for a project like Zulip that is very focused on making self-hosting Just Work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattermost.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;features&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattermost.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;features&#x2F;</a>

(Also, as much as I really don&#x27;t like the pricing change, I do really appreciate Zulip and its features!)<p>I feel like the comment is a bit disingenuous, however; the complaint isn&#x27;t &quot;Zulip Business only includes push notifications&quot; - rather, it&#x27;s &quot;the only thing I&#x27;d want out of paying for Zulip is push notifications.&quot; And indeed I would very happily pay for just notifications (which I assume costs a negligible fraction of the pricing) if it was a more reasonable price point (on the order of say, a dollar per user per month would still be a very healthy margin).<p>I suspect a lot of folks in a similar boat as me - sysadmins who pushed for Zulip as a Slack alternative at a small startup (with a nontrivial amount of convincing!) and are happy to deal with the hassles of self-hosting and don&#x27;t ask for support. Having the price be exactly the same as a fully hosted solution, given the particular set of needs, then does feel like too much. I get that support is expensive, but having the option to not get support would be nice.<p>Of course, I totally get that you need to stay afloat, and it might be a short term way to get some money out of self-hosted customers. But it removes things that make Zulip appealing to someone who doesn&#x27;t want support and would like to pay a more nominal fee for notifications (and certainly makes me less a lot likely to recommend it to someone setting up a new chat system, and I&#x27;ve done this a few times already).</div><br/><div id="38661179" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38661179" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FlamingMoe</span><span>|</span><a href="#38660799">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661960">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38661179">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38661179">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">+1 to this. I am one of those &quot;folks in a similar boat&quot;. I have spent the last month planning a migration of our team to self-hosted Zulip. I&#x27;ve utilized the great documentation and never once reached out to support for assistance. We are a team of 11, which means we now have to pay over $1k&#x2F;year to use a fully-functional version of Zulip.  We would have been happy to pay for notifications, but this is too much of a jump. I spent a portion of the afternoon researching Matrix Element as a possible alternative for our chat needs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38661960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38661960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tabbott</span><span>|</span><a href="#38660799">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661002">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661179">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38661960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38661960">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the thoughtful response! I really appreciate it. I&#x27;m doing my best to be as transparent as possible, so here&#x27;s a very long reply.<p>This is not a change motivated by short-term needs.<p>The problem statement is not that we need to fund the costs of delivering push notifications. We need to fund the costs of building Zulip -- the server, apps for every platform, support for a vast range of different self-hosted configurations, etc.<p>Yes, we are extremely capital-efficient with a small core team who have taken some very big pay cuts to work on 100% open-source software. But even so, we need a business model that makes sense. A business model based on charging a small markup on top of the marginal costs of delivering notifications can&#x27;t fund investments in the Zulip main experience or the self-hosted Zulip experience.<p>The main revenue source for Zulip thus far has been Zulip Cloud, and it&#x27;s proven hard to grow that business, largely due to competition with the $0 price of self-hosting Zulip, which gets you most of the features of Slack Plus ($12.50&#x2F;user&#x2F;month).<p>Zulip needs a healthy model where businesses that self-host Zulip (and rely on the SaaS push notifications service) contribute to its development, just like those that use the SaaS Zulip Cloud service. This doesn&#x27;t specifically require the same pricing for the two products. But it does preclude a model where Zulip Business only includes push notifications and is extremely cheap.<p>On the specifics of pricing, we of course have had a lot of conversations with users prior to this announcement. Most of the objections we heard were from system administrators who told us they would struggle to convince their company to pay even $1&#x2F;user&#x2F;month -- either because it was a big company whose bureaucracy had &quot;already bought Microsoft Teams&quot;, or because they were a startup that had a very very high bar for paying for software at all.<p>Meanwhile when we talked to leaders who make purchasing decisions for their company, they tend to think about budgets in comparison with other applications that their business relies on, or else compare with fully-loaded costs per employee, which are along the lines of 1000x the price of Zulip Business. Reactions tend to be: &quot;$6.67&#x2F;employee&#x2F;month? That&#x27;s nothing, I pay several times that for X, Y, and Z, which we use way less than our primary team collaboration tool.&quot;<p>If you think it&#x27;s priced too high, I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you chat with whoever at your business would approve spending money on your Zulip installation, get their feedback, and send us an email. There may well be some categories of customers that we missed in those conversations, and specific examples are very helpful for considering whether there&#x27;s a gap in our pricing model that we can patch.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38660961" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660961" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josephcsible</span><span>|</span><a href="#38660799">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660666">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660961">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660961">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Mobile push notifications must be centrally managed due to iOS and Android app store policies.<p>Is there any legitimate technical reason for this, or is it just Apple and Google being evil?</div><br/><div id="38660987" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660987" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattzito</span><span>|</span><a href="#38660961">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38661294">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660987">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660987">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It seems pretty reasonable to say, “if you want to send a push notification from an app, you should be the controller of the app”.<p>The alternative would be that anyone could send notifications to an app, which seems destined for abuse.

They come down to battery, radio and mobile network overheads.<p>Maintaining an open TCP&#x2F;IP or even UDP&#x2F;IP network socket to receive incoming notification messages requires sending a packet back and forth every so often to confirm the socket is live and keep it open, even while the socket is idle and there are no notifications.<p>You can technically open a socket without doing this, and this does work on parts of the internet.  It often works between devices on your LAN.  But many modern networks have unreliable connectivity, handovers between base stations (i.e. mobile or wifi), often one or more layers of NAT and&#x2F;or firewalls, and more.  The only generally reliable solution to get real-time inbound notifications to a device, is for the device to open an outbound socket and the protocol to send a packet occasioally in each direction.  The packets confirm liveness to the receiving endpoint, as well as telling other parts of the network the socket is still live.<p>When your device hasn&#x27;t received a confirmation after a configurable timeout, it&#x27;s time to open a new socket from the device, because the original socket may have stopped working.  The timeout lower bound depends on how much delay in notifications you can tolerate due to a non-working socket, and the upper bound is whatever keeps it working through all NATs and firewalls in the network, reduced by a margin to cover latency variance at an acceptable probability of disconnction.  Often the packets are implemented as a &quot;ping&quot; request-reply pair in the protocol, but actually there are other, more efficient patterns, and pings are not required at all during periods of other active traffic.<p>Those pings wake the radio in the mobile device, which drains the battery more than you&#x27;d think.<p>If you have 50 apps each using their own separate socket and background process, they will wake the radio up to 50 times more often as one app, assuming they have independent timing.<p>If the 50 apps are synchronised to communicate at about the same time, they will wake the radio less often to send and receive packets for multiple applictions in a single radio wakeup.  By itself this saves battery power, because the device&#x27;s radio is able to send multiple packets with only a little more power consumption than a single packet, if they are within the same time slot.  This also reduces radio overhead on the mobile network due to how time slots are negotiated among devices.<p>However, that requires all the apps to use very similar protocols and to synchronise somehow.  Even more power is saved by having one shared app (or service), with only one socket open to a shared server.  As long as that shared service handles notifications for the other 49 apps, and the 49 app notification channels are idle nearly always, the shared service reduces battery power consumption considerably, as well as reducing IP network traffic and mobile radio overheads.<p>That&#x27;s three technical reasons to have a single, centrally managed notification service per device.<p>Additionally, the device maintains real-time contact with the mobile network.  To do this, the mobile network protocol uses something like the above, sending a packet occasionally in each direction.  This happens at a lower level than the IP protocol used by apps, but the principle is similar, waking the radio every so often to keep a live channel going.<p>The mobile protocol is diferent from the internet protocol normal apps use.  The mobile protocl is robust enough to carry real-time notifications of calls and SMSes, among other things.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but when the mobile protocol is delayed or fails to deliver, an app using internet protocols (TCP or UDP) on top of the mobile protocol won&#x27;t do any better.<p>If the mobile carrier&#x2F;network supports it, the shared app notification service can wait for a special mobile protocol event.  Think of it like a magic SMS.  This notification event comes &quot;for free&quot;, as it uses the radio activity already being done efficietly by the mobile protocol, instead of an internet socket with ping packets and its own, separate background radio activity.  But this method requires a special arrangment with each mobile carrier, and functionality in the device OS.  It&#x27;s not as simple as the network-independent internet sockets which normal apps use.<p>That&#x27;s a fourth technical reason to have a single, special notification service.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38660666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Snuupy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38660961">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660666">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It would totally make sense for Zulip to have a UnifiedPush integration.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38660794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38660794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wellthisisgreat</span><span>|</span><a href="#38660666">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38660056">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38660794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38660794">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We use Zulip and $8 is VERY steep.<p>Is there any reason besides tradition to charge per seat?

As much as investors might balk at Intel today, the amount of money that Western governments can toss at the problem is effectively infinite. (Looking at Defense contractors as an example; horrendously inefficient, but tax revenue is effectively perpetually guaranteed to keep flowing.)<p>It&#x27;s silly to frame it this way, but even though the US and allies pay gobs for planes like the F-35, it&#x27;s also what continues to allow the stream of taxable money to continue.<p>I view Intel in a similar light. Even if they stay inefficient, there will still be money for a long time because the West needs a way to be self-sufficient. The cost of not having a backup is too high (tens of trillions of dollars when I last looked into it).<p>It&#x27;s a weird market that doesn&#x27;t obey a lot of the conventional rules of capitalism. Yes, it would be better if Intel were able to compete without government subsidies, and maybe they will. But even if they don&#x27;t it&#x27;s very unlikely they&#x27;ll totally crater because of how central this &quot;power&quot; is, and TSMC will never cede full control of their latest tech until the UN recognizes Taiwan as a distinct entity from China (imo).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42337634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42337634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vasco</span><span>|</span><a href="#42335742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337523">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42337261">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42337634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42337634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Intel won&#x27;t go down after receiving the billions it did for foundries.

A chip foundry and chip design of this level takes a long time to reach competence. Hell, if you are 1 generation behind status quo, Intel shows it can take 3 years to catch up, if then.<p>This company isn&#x27;t a struggling retailer in a sea of retailers (Sears) or some rando restaurant chain selling potato skins, blooming onions, and nachos (TGIFridays).<p>This is a top-line chip fabricator, in a geopolitical environment where supply lines&#x2F;shipping lines are under threat in the Pacific, demographic collapses in China, Japan, and South Korea are underway, and a president that wants to start a tariff war.<p>National security concerns underline Intels importance. It isn&#x27;t some chopshop private equity spreadsheet play. If you split it you need functional mission-based companies.<p>Intel has something like a dozen fabs. I would subdivide those into the lines of business their process nodes can serve, from embedded &#x2F; industrial stuff, board chipsets, whatever.<p>Identify the process nodes desperately needed for economic protection from a hostile&#x2F;collapsing China (same thing basically in economic impact). We need state of the art, so the latest and n-1 fabs get wrapped up, but we likely need a boatload of second and third tier node production as well.<p>I think Intel&#x27;s fabs can be split in the n-2 and n-3 nodes into two competing companies, because the US doesn&#x27;t need monopolies, it needs competition, and that will be the path to far better utilization of subsidies and speeding up production independence from the Asian rim.<p>I cannot believe Intel has failed at integrated graphics for so long. I&#x27;d like a competitor to NVidia besides AMD.<p>Setting up functional subsidiaries like this will absolutely not happen with private equity chopshops, all run by the same financial illusionists that have crushed Intel and Boeing.<p>But that&#x27;s not how the oligarchy works.

AMD has been executing perfectly on the CPU side, but they also happened to be a key beneficiary in an unprecedented event in the past few decades: TSMC overtaking Intel in their process which would likely not have happened without Apple betting on them.<p>Intel did not benefit from the stagnation they had which was enabled by their success and monopoly. Internet Explorer 6-level stagnation: from Haswell to ~2018 they successfully shipped the same product over and over again and when AMD pressure started to mount, they basically trickled down higher core counts into cheaper SKUs.

He had some lofty ideas,<p>I don&#x27;t know if I can say he was doing a good or bad job - it&#x27;s really hard to say. But were there good things about him that people say?<p>He was the first CEO to say Intel was underpaying. He promised to raise pay, made a deal with the board to do so, and delivered. Most people got something like a 20% pay boost. Still not FAANG level, but compared to the prior CEOs who said &quot;We pay fair market rates&quot;... yeah, he won points with a lot of employees for that.<p>He quickly banned stock buybacks. Throughout his tenure he focused on his Foundry plans and improving engineering practices, at the cost of share value. His plan was &quot;Let&#x27;s fix our fabs and our efficiency, get back to building world class products, and the financials will take care of themselves&quot;. As opposed to all his predecessors who did stock buybacks instead of investing the money into the company.<p>He convinced the board to cut the dividend to a third of its value - because Intel was paying triple the dividends that its competitors paid.<p>No doubt many didn&#x27;t like declining stocks, but no one can argue he was trying to artificially prop up the share price. His overall compensation was low.[1] He didn&#x27;t earn any of his performance based stocks, and didn&#x27;t try to manipulate those prices for personal gain. In the end he made a little over $10m per year - that includes the severance pay and signing bonus.<p>He was fairly good with transparency. He wanted the world to see the fab&#x27;s financials when he knew they were poor. The point was to give the world a real number that could be used as a metric of how well Intel is doing. $8B loss this year, with the hope of breaking even in the next few years.<p>This last thing is what probably got him fired because the stock tanked after that (I don&#x27;t know why - everyone knew it was unprofitable...).<p>Declining revenues are due to Intel products not competing. How much of that is Pat&#x27;s fault - hard to say. Intel was making poor products for a while, and partly due to a poor fab process - which is precisely what Pat was trying to fix (5 nodes in 4 years is <i>unprecedented</i>, and it looks like Intel will achieve it). Lunar Lake was built on TSMC, and is a fairly decent product. Overall, the gap between AMD and Intel has shrunk.<p>Finally, perhaps the reason people really hated him: The layoffs. But as is often pointed out on HN, if you compare Intel&#x27;s headcount with comparable companies (AMD, Nvidia), you can see Intel is really wasteful. The revenue per person is much, much lower. You can compare just the Intel Products head count (excluding the fabs). The layoffs had to happen. And there have to be more if Intel wants to be competitive. It can no longer command high margins.<p>So yeah, plenty hate him. But plenty do like him.<p>&gt; but he clearly wasn’t executing well with Intel’s bread and butter business.<p>Nor were the previous two CEOs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;pat-gelsinger-lost-massive-140-213723546.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;pat-gelsinger-lost-massive-14...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42335601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42335601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jackyinger</span><span>|</span><a href="#42335525">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42336143">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42335669">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42335601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42335601">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you care to read the article you’ll find evidence of Pat’s competence.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42335669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42335669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rvba</span><span>|</span><a href="#42335525">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42335601">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42336261">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42335669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42335669">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Guy praying on twitter does not sound like some scientist to me, although article says he did 486</div><br/><div id="42336127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42336127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tgma</span><span>|</span><a href="#42335525">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42335669">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42335870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42336127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42336127">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lots of top tier scientists have been religious.

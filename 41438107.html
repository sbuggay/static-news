The top hit is already marked, shown in a preview window below, and can be opened by clicking enter. But if you want a different result, you just navigate that search buffer to find the hit you want.<p>The search triggered by a link is sorted such that it shows first “comefrom links” (if any file has said explicitly said that “these keywords should lead here”), then headline results (files where your phrase is in the note title), then siblings (other notes that link to the same keywords), then fulltext search matches (any file that just contains those words). So if you have 0 results with those keywords in the title after renaming a note, you might still find the note again via full-text search hits below. If you have 2+ results, just navigate between them with the arrow keys while previewing their contents, and open the one you want.<p>This design is intentional: The author advocates to “write fragmentarily, read collectively”; so instead of refinding an old note and adding to it, you can make a new note with a similar title where you capture new info, and then links will point to both notes from now on. (In most cases, if their titles are similar, the contents are likely relevant in the same situations as well.)<p>With that said, Howm supports exact links as well: You can link to a file path instead of a title. Since Howm defaults to putting just the creation datetime in the note filename, the filename is by default like an immutable-ish UUID, and such links should remain exact as long as you don’t manually move or remove a file. By default, Howm creates such links in one context: If you create a note (C-c , c) while inside another note, it saves an exact back link to where you came from so you can remember your “inspiration”. But you are of course free to use such links everywhere instead of the “fuzzy links” above if you prefer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41442204" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41442204" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_huayra_</span><span>|</span><a href="#41438108">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41440244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41442204">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41442204">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Does anyone have a &quot;lab notebook&quot; style of PKM in Emacs?<p>I used to use Org-Roam in Emacs, but fell in love with Logseq [0], primarily because<p>1. it has a &quot;daily journal&quot; default workflow (though individual pages are supported)<p>2. the support of datalog queries<p>3. templates<p>This basically allows me to make templates for things I need (e.g. meeting notes, etc) and to write a few key queries (that are also templated for reuse) to do things like get the most overdue tasks, upcoming, things I promised to others, things I&#x27;m waiting on, etc. I can even drill down and get that stuff for an individual &quot;page&quot;, e.g. &quot;Emacs&quot; or &quot;C++&quot;.<p>The lack of a &quot;lab journal&quot; format + flexible queries makes going back to other solutions not as enticing, as the &quot;perfect artifact&quot; of wiki-esque editing (and not being able to easily see backlinks) is not as easy. I can open my Logseq folder, make a &quot;meeting&quot; template, then #tag the people and topics discussed, and be able to go back later and make a query to see when I discussed #topic with #person.<p>I would love to move this back into Emacs, as I hate having a separate tool for PKM, so if anyone has a similar workflow (or at least flexible queries on &quot;tags&quot; and task status, backlinks, etc, even without the daily journal thing), I&#x27;d be grateful for any tips.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logseq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logseq.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="41442239" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41442239" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">evertedsphere</span><span>|</span><a href="#41442204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41443117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41442239">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41442239">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">org-roam has a daily journal feature, which i use extensively: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orgroam.com&#x2F;manual.html#org_002droam_002ddailies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orgroam.com&#x2F;manual.html#org_002droam_002ddailies</a><p>for querying: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alphapapa&#x2F;org-ql">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alphapapa&#x2F;org-ql</a><p>for templates, see org-roam-capture and its templating system (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orgroam.com&#x2F;manual.html#The-Templating-System" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orgroam.com&#x2F;manual.html#The-Templating-System</a>), which extends the capture templating system of vanilla org. for nicer capture templates, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;progfolio&#x2F;doct">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;progfolio&#x2F;doct</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41443117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41443117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">setopt</span><span>|</span><a href="#41442204">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41442239">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41440244">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41443117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41443117">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also used Logseq for a couple of years during my PostDoc and it is an excellent product. I also got into the habit of writing everything in the daily journal (with things like [[emacs]] in each top-level bullet so that I could read it under the Emacs page). I tried replicating this workflow in other system, including Obsidian and Org Roam and Denote which all support back links and journals – it works but it  wasn’t as smooth as Logseq’s transclusion.<p>Currently, I’m using Howm, and am quite happy with that. Its motto is “write fragmentarily and read collectively”, which summarizes well what I liked about Logseq.<p>It’s however a slightly different workflow: I launch “howm-list-all” (I bind it to F12) to see a list of all notes, which I use  similarly to Logseq’s journal. To read recent entries, use arrow keys or n&#x2F;p to move between recent notes (which I use like top-level bullets in the Logseq journal), which are instantly previewed in a pane below. Or press “c” (create) to create a new note, which is automatically date stamped. Whenever I in Logseq would create a new top-level journal bullet, I in Howm create a new datestamped Org file. For sub-bullets I use Org outlining. But it largely has the same feel to me as Logseq’s journal system although it maps to different files on disk.<p>Instead of Logseq hashtags, I use Howm’s comefrom links. So say I am working on a project called “Foo Bar”. In Logseq, I’d type [[Foo Bar]] in my journal every time I think about that project. In Howm, I’d make a new note that contains a Howm link of the form “&lt;&lt;&lt; Foo Bar”. Now, whenever I write the exact phrase “Foo Bar” (without any link syntax!) in another note, it <i>automatically</i> becomes a clickable link pointing to my Foo Bar page! I find this more efficient actually than Logseq’s approach since “typing the backlink instead of the link” feels like less cognitive overhead and less work. (Logseq has “unlinked mentions” but it somehow felt less reliable.)<p>Note that Howm supports any text format (it’s a minor mode), and thus doesn’t mind if you import your existing Logseq Markdown files but write new content in Org-mode, for example. It also supports searching multiple folders, so that you can link from new Howm notes to old Logseq notes without “importing” them.<p>I hope this helps, and would encourage you to give Howm a try. It doesn’t help with templates and queries, but as the sibling post touched upon you could try using org-capture for templates and either org-ql or org-super-agenda for queries. Howm and Org work well together, so there’s no reason you can’t use different packages to replace different parts of Logseq in Emacs. (Logseq itself is a great product, but I prefer Org-mode for the keybindings and export.)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41440244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41440244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ta988</span><span>|</span><a href="#41442204">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41442814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41440244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41440244">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing I learned about PKMs is that it is not how many feature it has that dictates its usefulness, it is about how many features you are not encumbered by.

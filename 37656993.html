I showed my teacher that was how a computer memory worked... and she said &quot;That is not what they are for.&quot; Not disappointed, two years later I got the RS Electronics project kit, and raced through all the projects, and worked through the Books, with a few extra parts. Some how, my dad (MsEE) always had a few extra parts I needed. I soon had a bad attitude about being able to fix anything electronic. On to Programming. Three decades later someone walked into the computer group fix-it clinic, and asked to plug in a &#x27;Micro-Tops&#x27; ok... what is it? It was made by Forest Mimms III? omg... I have known that name since I was a child. I hooked him up, gave him my copies of my books, and had them autographed. He may be a climate change denier, but he allowed principal measurements of the ozone hole, and provided irrefutable proof of Dr Drew Schdell, of NASA Goddard, theories on the ozone hole. Kind of a bummer when you do that. Oh, and just by the way...<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;search?query=Forrest+M+Mims" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;search?query=Forrest+M+Mims</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37668888" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37668888" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tapvt</span><span>|</span><a href="#37671894">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37671545">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37668888">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37668888">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This article is brimming with nostalgia for me.

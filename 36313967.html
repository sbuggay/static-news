In the post-War era, they became beige-suited company men. In my generation, they went corporate finance. Today, they work for private equity.<p>Banking was great. Everyone–from liberal arts to engineering majors–could putz around for years in a pre-defined and prestigious path with moderately above-market pay and the potential to become rich. (Most don&#x27;t.) It was also a field that could absorb a lot of grunt work, because most of what these folks did was format PowerPoints and populate Excel templates.<p>After the GFC, bulge-bracket finance became less prestigious right when technology lowered the industry&#x27;s hunger for grunts. Silicon Valley took up some slack, but at least until the pandemic hiring boom, there was a <i>modicum</i> of technical gating factors.<p>The entire time, corporate and industrial America needed administration. But working at a chemical plant in Baton Rouge isn&#x27;t sexy. You know what <i>is</i> sexy? Working for KKR.<p>So KKR&#x27;s partners buy the plant, hire the college grad, give them a few weeks&#x27; training and &quot;deploy&quot; them to Baton Rouge. That will be their &quot;project&quot; for years. There are perks: they get to fly in from a city, for instance. But overall, the partners can acquire this labor cheaper than their portolio companies. (Ask anyone who isn&#x27;t a partner at a private equity firm what they do, and it&#x27;s on a spectrum between administrative assistance and middle management in a random business.) It&#x27;s what consulting did in another era, re-branded for what young people willing to take less pay and power predict their peers and parents find prestigious (and what they consider safe).</div><br/><div id="36318501" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36318501" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TrackerFF</span><span>|</span><a href="#36317284">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36322956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36318501">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36318501">[25 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, they are called &quot;Insecure overachievers&quot;.

A couple of years ago I was talking with this (big law) partner at a dinner, and we came in on the topic around partnership - and he just said it straight: The competition &#x2F; rat race towards partnership is 100% skewed to the firms advantage. They get dozens of highly motivated, highly competent professionals competing against each others to prove their worth. They&#x27;ll be on call 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365 to show that they&#x27;re worthy of partnership.

The overachievers is a bit optimistic, though. I’ve been in almost all the domains you mentioned and I would call it overtriers. I would not think overall statistically people would be making more, and if it is the same, then why is the model a bad proposition? My experience is, with partnerships, if you are not on a fast moving track in your first 5 years, then it’s time to move on.

Maybe PE reacted in a way that was not the wisest in your friend’s opinion, but everyone scrambled and few succeeded.</div><br/><div id="36317553" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36317553" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pc86</span><span>|</span><a href="#36316046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36316343">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36321860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36317553">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36317553">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I dated a vet tech several years before COVID and it sounded like a horrendous job. $20&#x2F;hr was considered good pay, you&#x27;re constantly bending over, pickup up things (sometimes things that definitively do <i>not</i> to get picked up), and you&#x27;re literally dealing with some of the shittiest parts of animal care.</div><br/><div id="36318119" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36318119" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TylerE</span><span>|</span><a href="#36316046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36317553">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36319968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36318119">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36318119">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Better than doing the same work with heavier patients in nursing homes for $12&#x2F;hr.</div><br/><div id="36318370" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36318370" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slimsag</span><span>|</span><a href="#36316046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36318119">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36319968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36318370">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36318370">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The level of mental trauma endured by vets I doubt is matched by elderly care nurses.</div><br/><div id="36319314" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36319314" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anigbrowl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36316046">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36318370">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36319016">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36319314">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36319314">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of my first jobs was in a nursing home, and lemme tell you it&#x27;s a pretty shit job.

I&#x27;ve stopped going to places when they lose my favorite staff member, and places a lot less consequential than a vet.  This might translate to loss customers in the mid term, but you might not notice until their next vet visit in ~12 months.  This might translate to bad yelp reviews.<p>* Presumably most of those vets let go are going to continue to be vets.  It&#x27;s a high skill job that pays well and people get into it for passion.

If you are a doctor looking to retire and sell your business <i>there is no one else right now who would buy it</i>. The same goes for every category of &quot;mom and pop&quot; business in the US. Even if you could find someone experienced enough and interested in running it - that person could not afford the business.<p>So there is kind of a double problem happening right now. One is simply demographic - experienced business owners are retiring at a much faster rate than they are being replaced. Secondly, there is the capitalization problem. A doctor knows what his practice is worth and wants every cent he can get out of it - but the next generation of doctor is not going to be able to compete with debt financing what a PE cash-buyer can get.<p>In addition, there is a problem specific to medical practices - you can&#x27;t just hand them over to your kid! (unless they also happened to pursue the exact same medical training you did). <i>And in addition to this</i> medical schools (as I have been told) are really underprepared new doctors for running a business.<p>Keep in mind owner-operators already get a huge income and tax incentive over PE firms. It&#x27;s kind of a perfect storm that makes medical clinics such a special target vs plumbers or landscapers or whatever.<p>If you want clinics to stay independent <i>and keep retiring doctors happy</i>, we are going to have to carve out special programs or tax breaks for young doctors to buy up these businesses with debt.

You want to live there because of family reasons or whatever.  You build a great thriving practice.  You’re clearing $1m in profit annually.<p>(A high, but doable number for a dermatologist with a good private practice)<p>Now it’s time to retire.<p>First of all, you can’t sell a patient.  Patients go where they want to.  You also can’t sell medical records.  Because laws. Nor really would you want to.<p>All you can do is sell patient habits, and tangible assets.<p>But of course the biggest asset is the physician themselves. And they don’t come with the practice when they retire.<p>Now sure.  There are ways of driving non-directly-physician-derived lines of revenue in a practice.  Maybe you have a nurse that does aesthetics.  Maybe you sell skin creams or whatever.  But generally, those lines of revenue are still broadly dependent on the physician.<p>So what you need is a physician who wants to move to Lincoln, Nebraska at the same time you want to retire, and buy your practice.<p>But even if another dermatologist <i>did</i> want to practice in Lincoln at the right time, why should they pay a bunch of money to you for <i>your</i> practice?  They could just start up next door.<p>Sure, they’d have to buy some equipment and hire and train staff, but there’s a good chance they’d have to do some of that even buying your practice.<p>And truth be told, they know you’re retiring anyway, so why not just wait it out?<p>Plus, medical specialists are in short supply. Especially those who want to move to Lincoln at that very moment.  (I’m being hard on Lincoln.  I went there once and it was nice.  I just don’t imagine it’s a destination most highly qualified medical specialists dream of moving to.)<p>So probably the actual value of your practice is “the number that makes it less of a hassle to buy you out than for another specialist to start up their own practice.” Assuming there <i>is</i> a specialist who wants to move to where you’re selling.<p>And remember, if such a person already exists, they already own the most valuable asset of your practice: a qualified medical specialist.<p>So in a traditional medical practice sale scenario, your valuation almost certainly isn’t going to be a multiple of your revenue or profit like a more traditional business.<p>And the location can be a real challenge too.  I know classmates of my spouse who turned down salary offers in the $800k range in the rural Midwest (with the potential to earn much more in the future through partnership&#x2F;ownership) in order to make less than half that in the cities they wanted to live in.<p>Even if your practice is in a desirable location, most of these issues still apply.  It’s just much more likely you’ll find someone to buy your practice for some value and not have to shut it down and sell it for parts.</div><br/><div id="36319066" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36319066" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taeric</span><span>|</span><a href="#36315371">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36318761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36316379">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36319066">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36319066">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is painting physicians as more unique than they are.

With physicians, this is kind of a consequence of a system their professional organizations have shaped: they kind of brought this (&quot;this&quot; being lack of buyers) on themselves to some extent by restricting supply.<p>But even outside of that, if you ignore that part of it, there&#x27;s monopolization costs coming from other directions. Many physicians are getting squeezed by decreases in their options, as hospitals and clinics merge, which creates efficiencies that make it hard for small clinics to compete with, which in turn leads to fewer administrative options should a physician choose to try somsething else. My sense is it&#x27;s even worse than that, because even if you still have a few large hospital systems to choose from, the administrators are being incentivized in the same ways across the chains, so it&#x27;s one flavor of hyperprofitized healthcare corporation versus another flavor of hyperprofitized healthcare corporation. Basically, it&#x27;s hard for small clinics to compete even if someone wants to, because healthcare has become a cuthroat profit-driven market, with lots of big money and plenty of opportunities for those in power to take advantage of advantages.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is it&#x27;s not just the debt for the young physician: it&#x27;s a very risky thing to do, period, being a small clinic versus an oligopoly of large chains. &quot;A doctor knows what his practice is worth and wants every cent he can get out of it&quot; is one possibility, but another is that that seller is in a position of survivorship bias, and can&#x27;t find buyers because they don&#x27;t see it as a rational decision even outside of the debt question.<p>The reason why you don&#x27;t see this with landscapers or plumbers or whatever is because those markets have far more competition, and they&#x27;re not overregulated (at least to the same extent). Healthcare as a market is characterized by obstacles to competition everywhere: if you ignore the rationale for those obstacles, and just look at it for what it is, you&#x27;re left with an infrastructure that&#x27;s constituted largely of barriers and costs to entry and participation. Basically, the market has become too expensive even for practitioners to participate fully in, so the only thing left are financial heavyweights.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36319524" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36319524" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#36315371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36319789">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36318524">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36319524">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36319524">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Even if you could find someone experienced enough and interested in running it - that person could not afford the business.<p>I mean, this must be a huge factor.

(if I&#x27;m wrong about that threshold, the internet will correct me.)<p>I should disclose that early in my career I would do job interviews recreationally on my lunch hours just to get good at them, so it&#x27;s not reasonable to just use what I say as a reference, and I&#x27;ve done serious reading and practice on negotiation theory and a bunch of other business topics, so  essentially, I look at companies like an investor when I decide to work for them. Part of that is getting a sense of what their cap table probably looks like, because that drives the incentives in the product and organization.  If you need a job, take what&#x27;s available, but if you are serious, look at how startups necessarily survive as a function of their runway and board structure. Brad Feld&#x27;s &quot;Venture Deals&quot; is a good reference, as is YC&#x27;s startup school library (all free online) and then maybe Jeffery Pfeffer, then DeMesquita and Smith. Then understand how your own skills get them through the incentive structures described in those books. PE creates a set of incentives in an organization that are orthogonal to startup growth, they&#x27;re just different types of companies.  Once you know the board structure and the cap table, the survival of every company flows from the incentives that creates, imo.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36314640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36314640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">awaythrow483</span><span>|</span><a href="#36315002">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36322742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36314640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36314640">[22 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you want to understand what went wrong with America, start with private equity</div><br/><div id="36314756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36314756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hospitalJail</span><span>|</span><a href="#36314640">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36317470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36314756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36314756">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Lobbying&#x2F;Bribery seems more egregious than investing.<p>At least investing has some economic forces that cause people to conserve resources and allocate them better than prior.<p>Lobbying&#x2F;Bribery is just pure corruption.

This is drastically simplified. The shoehorned part of the analogy is that a bank won&#x27;t exactly lend as described below.<p>You take out a mortgage for a property you intend to cashflow by posting it on AirBnB. You open an LLC to do so. You put down a fraction of the price of the home, let&#x27;s say 5-10% and then you do some upgrades, but you borrow against the price of the home for the upgrades, not against your own credit. Now, you start AirBnBing this very nice house out for absolute top dollar. It&#x27;s nice and people love it, you have great reviews. Every time you get a payment from AirBnB, you take most of the money and move it to your personal bank account as a &quot;management fee&quot; or a &quot;bonus&quot; and you put the smallest amount possible into the mortgage and the second mortgage (the one you used to upgrade the house). Now, as the house gets more use, or you cut costs, say on having the pool cleaned, or on yard maintenance, the house goes down in quality pretty significantly, but your original AirBnB ratings are there and people are willing to pay significant sums so you continue to rake in cash, and you try to avoid maintenance as much as possible.<p>Eventually, the place is a run down heap, and people are leaving terrible reviews, so you stop having bookings&#x2F;cashflow. Okay, now you just send the keys to the bank and say &quot;it&#x27;s your problem&quot;. They get a rundown house that has barely repaid its mortgage, and you get to keep the cash. The trick is to have moved a lot more cash into your account than you lose in the mortgage down payment.<p>Edit: I should add that PE firms aren&#x27;t always trying to extract value at the cost of the business (sometimes they absolutely are). However, they are always incentivized to make cash flow and take maximum business risk for potentially even larger payout.</div><br/><div id="36317704" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36317704" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JumpCrisscross</span><span>|</span><a href="#36314640">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36315345">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36316235">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36317704">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36317704">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Every time you get a payment from AirBnB, you take most of the money and move it to your personal bank account as a &quot;management fee&quot; or a &quot;bonus&quot; and you put the smallest amount possible into the mortgage and the second mortgage</i><p>Correction: you pay your debt first.

The typical plan is usually to use business revenue to finance the interest payments, optimize the business via cost-cuts or roll-ups, and flip it for a profit in 5-7 years.
 Like most things, PE can be helpful or destructive depending on the execution and the exact strategy for flipping.<p>At its best, it’s bringing in experienced operators and maturing a company into something that is stable, before selling it to an acquirer or IPO.<p>At its worst, it’s saddling a weak business with debt, hiring terrible execs, and making unsustainable cost cuts to stave off an implosion.<p>The strategy matters a lot.

If they see that they have the chance to sell one of their assets at a great price, they don&#x27;t have any issue with anyone holding the bag. There were at least a few IPOs&#x2F;SPACs that left the (relatively less-savvy) public holding the bag.<p>2. PE investors tend to be be finance-minded, not operations-focused. That means that their planned optimizations think about the financial health of a company, not the &quot;real&quot; health. Culture can suffer because of this, for example.<p>3.

(Think Paulie buying all those cases of Cutty Sark in Goodfellas.) When the note comes due, the mobster simply torches the restaurant and collects the insurance money.

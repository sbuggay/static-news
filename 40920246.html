A 1970s Milton Bradley Big Trak and a Radio Shack TRS-80, both popular products in their day, will, if brought near to each other, both crash.
Without fairly strict regulation of unwanted RF emissions, there would be many incompatible devices. There were before the FCC started requiring more testing in the 1970s. A world with a huge number of consumer devices emitting RF noise would have prevented low-power cellular phone and WiFi deployment.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard. This is an &quot;unintentional emitter&quot; (it&#x27;s not trying to send a radio signal). The rules for that are not too bad. Testing costs about $3000 to $5000.<p>You want to have some ability to pre-test. You might find something. Attaching a wire to something can give it an antenna and make it emit much more RF, so you do need to test. It&#x27;s not too hard.[1] Actual FCC certification is $3000 to $5000, assuming you pre-tested and fixed any problems before getting a certification run.<p>From the project&#x27;s FAQ:<p><i>&quot;Given that this will initially be a niche product, the price will be quite high.

Mail it to them!</i><p>I worked on a equipment project for a large restaurant chain about a decade ago. The core application and related assets&#x2F;recipes&#x2F;files were all on an SD card. When it was time to upgrade the app or release new seasonal recipes, every store got a new SD card in the mail with instructions to wait for a certain date, power down, swap cards, power back on, dispose of the old card.<p>It was <i>way</i> cheaper to send updates that way than bother with encryption, networking, corrupted disks, etc. A bricked machine lost a hundred dollars or more per hour. If the new card failed, the operator could continue with the old one until a replacement could be sent.<p>One major problem was suppliers always trying to swap to lower cost SD cards, even counterfeit ones (c.f. Bunnie), and things would go south really fast. The Linux system and hardware were both pretty old and had MMC stack issues when the cards showed shaky margins on the timing. Or, capacity wasn&#x27;t what was advertised (c.f Bunnie). We had to spend a cycle or two qualifying each mailing release to make sure a shitty batch of cards didn&#x27;t make its way into the stream.<p>SD has its uses, although I still prefer a read-only eMMC partition to hold the bootloader and O&#x2F;S. I don&#x27;t get why RPi users put themselves through such misery to save $20 on their SBC.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40923331" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923331" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#40923184">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40924704">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923331">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923331">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Normally, market forces would dictate that by now it would be straightforward, fast, and affordable to get your product tested as frequently as desired.

However, they are generally hesitant to work with people who don’t really know what they’re doing.<p>If you are an engineer with knowledge about the process and who needs a lab to partner with, it’s not hard to get in somewhere.<p>However, if you don’t have the knowledge or experience, the lab might sense that you’re looking for someone to hold your hand heavily through the process. They may be less than enthusiastic to take on a one-off customer who might require an abnormally high amount of communication and hand-holding when they can fill that same spot with a repeat customer who needs nothing more than to book the time at the lab and can show up prepared and ready to go.<p>I suggest teaming up with a local consultant for your first round. Not only will they help you through the process, they’ll have connections and reputation to get you into the labs.<p>The lab fees aren’t extraordinary high for a hardware startup, really.

I now consult on product compliance. Author you are welcome to contact me.<p>Disclaimer: Nothing below is meant as legally relevant compliance advice. This is just my opinion on the matter.<p>Going to snark:<p><i>&quot;The testing and certification industry is odd&quot;</i><p>Except, outside the software world, the real world, where there are real consequences, it&#x27;s not really.<p><i>&quot;The line about CES, in particular, made my hair stand up.&quot;</i><p>Why? Absolutely the unauthorised device at CES is should NOT be allowed. What if said device caused too much interference on cell phone frequencies and suddenly nobody at CES can dial the local emergency number?<p>If that made &quot;your hair stand up&quot;, here&#x27;s one from personal experience that will freeze your blood:<p>I worked as a teen for a certain electronics chain. Said chain was selling a wireless weather station imported from China. A government department that monitored the country for Earthquakes noticed that this device impinged on their frequencies. After the spectrum regulator confirmed the finding, a nice gentleman from them visited us a told us the following:<p>1) As of this moment this device can no longer be sold. Move it off the floor immediately (he stayed and made sure we did exactly that).<p>2) That we will immediately issue a recall of said device at your own cost and issue full refunds to the customers.<p>3) He will return when we decide on further enforcement action which may include punitive fines and recommendations for further remedial action you will need to undertake.<p><i>&quot;In theory, it exists to serve the public good and uphold consumer protection laws.&quot;</i><p>Well here&#x27;s a (very simplistic) tidbit for the author: In the US, part of the gestation and formation of standards bodies and testing was &quot;market forces&quot;, not for the public good. It was to help protect companies from litigation. If you followed the standards, tested and certed to them, paid the fees etc you then had the standards entity bat for you in court (UL is short for <i>Underwriters</i> Laboratory. That name was not chosen for funsies).<p><i>&quot;However, in reality, the labs are “too busy” to respond or reply very late and generally sound less than eager to work with you.&quot;</i><p>Well you don&#x27;t sound like a serious customer. AND the Labs are not there to give you advice. They&#x27;re there to do INDEPENDENT testing.<p><i>&quot;Variations of the FCC exist in pretty much every developed economy. Putting a poorly tested hardware product on the market immediately puts a target on your back. Maybe you’ll get lucky, but chances are that someone somewhere will report you. And, unless you are operating entirely out of China, it will hurt. A lot. Both your company and maybe even you, personally.&quot;</i><p>As it should. The electromagnetic spectrum is a very precious and very limited commodity and IMO, the best regulated &quot;commons&quot; in human civilisation (though still not perfect). So no, you are not welcome to just urinate in it willy nilly with your hustler start up product.<p><i>&quot;I did not want to spend so much money on testing before I validated the market or gathered a community of believers.&quot;</i><p>And there it is.<p><i>&quot;This way, the electronic device liability will fall on the manufacturer, and the magic of friendship EULA should afford me enough protection to make this a pure software play.&quot;</i><p>No. That&#x27;s not how this works.<p>1) I assume the author is from the US (as they speak about the FCC). I had a 30 second look at these dev boards and their instructions. There is no FCC conformity declarations or markings, so US customers can&#x27;t use it.<p>2) It has CE and UKCA though, so customers from EU+UK (and some other countries) can buy them but the certs only cover the dev boards AS SOLD. (i.e without the authors software)<p>3) Author is modifying the product behavior with their software. So yes author. You are still liable. Technically, your customers are first in the line of fire.  But the likely sequence of steps is: Friendly Spectrum Representative will visit them first, have a chat, ask them to stop using the device, then leave them a lone and then come for YOU.<p>4) What the author has <i>actually</i> done is &quot;buy down&quot; their risk. It is simply less likely that the product will become non-compliant when their software is loaded. But it is still possible. At second glance, those dev boards don&#x27;t come with a power supply. What is your recommended power supply to use Author? Have you tested your setup with said power supply and have test reports at the ready for when Friendly Spectrum Person comes knocking?<p>5) Sure it seems clever but Friendly Spectrum Agencies actually have quite far reaching and scary powers. Don&#x27;t think that your little sleight of hand here is clever and protects you. Fundamentally: You are repackaging + modifying an existing product. The steps you are taking in between to &quot;launder&quot; your liability are irrelevant.<p>Frankly, it&#x27;s shit like this, that makes it harder for everyone else playing by the rules. It did actually used to be easier. There used to be exemptions for &quot;low volume&quot; products. But all of those were seen as loopholes and HEAVILY abused. Now these toys have been taken away, with more to follow.</div><br/><div id="40924084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40924084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">someonenice</span><span>|</span><a href="#40923262">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40923491">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40924084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40924084">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; 3) Author is modifying the product behavior with their software.

- Does this meant that recertification is required every time we load a different version of the software ?
- How does this work for Computers and mobile phones ?

Part of this is culture, and that&#x27;s hard to change - engineers see what they do as an art, and this is fine,and it&#x27;s a good thing as some engineering systems do have a disproportionate impact, but I think the tone of the response also does reflect an attitude of perfectionism and &quot;this at any cost&quot; that I think holds the field back.<p>I think the solution is not rather to &quot;just let people run amok&quot; (though as it happens, this is the strategy China is testing for us and it appears to not have broken too much yet - the land of trillions of SOIC-8 Bluetooth MCUs with no shielding and a 5-line BOM) but rather for the engineering world to embrace the software developers and provide a happy path to compliance.<p>If you want North America to compete with China on having ubiquitous technologies everywhere (this is the only way to build out the supply chain), we have to come up with a way to fix certification and part of the attitude has to be &quot;we&#x27;re going to teach you how to cheaply get your product to market in a way that respects the spectrum&quot;, and not &quot;it&#x27;s expensive, deal with it&quot;. This one is tough for people to accept but we cannot ever go back to stuff being expensive, as the floodgates have already been opened.<p>This is something that the government has to do, probably - provide funding to run (at least, cut down versions of the labs for precompliance) cheaply, put out good resources. Encourage or fund the creation of low-cost and easy to understand paths to compliance. As anyone knows, if you try to hold your nose to stop a nosebleed, the blood just goes down your throat. Same with all of the stuff from China. If you want to meaningfully improve device compliance, making the process hard and painful will just increase the number of random Amazon&#x2F;Temu Bluetooth nonsense with a total lack of attention to design at all. If we made the process more accessible, it&#x27;s possible that this would drive the industry to create solutions that might not even cost more, but are more compliant - which would be a win overall.</div><br/><div id="40923568" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40923568" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Palomides</span><span>|</span><a href="#40923262">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40923494">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40923568">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40923568">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">hard agree, it sucks immensely that I can design a cool 4 layer PCB with multicore processor in an afternoon, throw on a standard bluetooth module, and have it manufactured and shipped to me in a week for like $100, but heaven forbid I want to sell five of them to fellow nerds on a niche forum without breaking multiple laws, and the path to compliance is, uh, find a consultant with EMI testing experience and industry connections and&#x2F;or spend $5000?<p>and then amazon is full of absolutely noncompliant untested stuff with no consequences</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

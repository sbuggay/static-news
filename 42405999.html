Hell, even smartphones are just a reference to Sci-Fi flicks from the 60s (the case was Apple VS Samsung, I think). On demand services and the easy piracy of digital goods... I feel while there has been an perceived increase in quality for each individual at first, all these things helped everything to converge into &quot;the average&quot; for everyone.<p>We still see originality here and there, but you can just feel their competition against big budget productions. The movie <i>Mandy</i> (2018) was great, so was the show <i>Scavengers Reign</i> (2023), <i>Breaking Bad</i> etc. <i>Landscape FM</i> produce really interesing audio gear. I&#x27;m sure Open-Source (Hard- and Software) makes a lot of this possible, but for small and big equaly alike - depending on business practice, small might even be in danger to suffer from it.<p>I&#x27;m sure we all have our gems, but they just feel rare in this huge landscape.

Why spend tons of money on a fancy headquarters with the top end of everything when instead you could just as easily give yourself all that money via stock buybacks, and then spend it on a yacht? And it&#x27;s not like your competitors or customers give half a shit anymore, they all work in equally boring and dull campuses.<p>- To most people unfortunate enough to live in areas where cars are a necessity, they are at best, a convenient alternative to walking and at worst, an ongoing tax on their livelihood that must be paid. Your average Joe or Jane cares that a car is reliable and gets good fuel economy. The only people who care about looks are those that are status obsessed, and to them, the logo means far more than anything on the actual bodywork. Most of the status enabled vehicles are also identical to the cheaper ones, differed only by badges. It isn&#x27;t even just platforms as the article says; tons of vehicles are outright <i>the same damn vehicle</i> being sold under a number of brands and models... because it&#x27;s cheaper.<p>And as for less obvious things like AirBnBs and Coffee shops, it&#x27;s just cheaper to imitate what&#x27;s already working than doing any work to see what might be more interesting. Yeah those particular looks won out, but odds are that&#x27;s less because of anything inherent to them, and more because it just... did, a no more consequential decision on the part of the universe than which specific fish happened to get legs right the first time. But for it being a different fish, maybe we&#x27;d all have legs that curved backwards instead of forwards at the knee.<p>And instagram face is what it is, as the article says, because of Kim Kardashian. Because she certainly didn&#x27;t originate the concept of being famous for being famous, but she did perfect it, utterly buff it to a mirror shine, and what is being an influencer if not that?</div><br/></div></div><div id="42406368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seydor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406405">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406535">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Global optimum</div><br/></div></div><div id="42406535" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406535" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LoganDark</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406368">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406535">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406535">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve noticed this in many categories, where almost everything in the category converges extremely specifically on qualities that I simply... do not like, at all.

There are two ways this is true: categorization and imperfection.<p>Everything subjective has genres, then sub-genres, that a smaller group of people like, down to the individual. If something is very popular and&#x2F;or mainstream in its sub-genre it becomes popular in its genre, and if very popular and&#x2F;or mainstream in its genre becomes popular mainstream.<p>Everything subjective has &quot;guidelines&quot; it must follow in order to be popular, and the genres and sub-genres have further guidelines. But it can&#x27;t follow <i>every</i> guideline or it won&#x27;t be popular. At minimum people become desensitized, also some stated &quot;guidelines&quot; are wrong and the inherent &quot;guideline&quot; is different, because people don&#x27;t completely know what they like. Because people don&#x27;t completely know what they like, there are also &quot;rare guidelines&quot; that nobody follows or states but would create something especially popular, and rare guidelines create new genres.<p>For example, music. Almost every song (even non-traditional) has these common components: 12-tone equal temperament, simple time signature, &quot;melody&quot; &quot;harmony&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot;, etc.. Jazz, rock, electronic, etc. and have their own guidelines. Perhaps jazz was created because jazz chords used to be a rare guideline. But no song, even pop music, follows 100% of the guidelines. At minimum, instruments don&#x27;t produce pure sine&#x2F;square&#x2F;triangle waves, melody has accents or modulation, etc. And the most popular songs do something novel (either completely novel, or they take something novel from a less-popular song and do better in other areas).<p>So how does this relate to the age of average? People know what I said above. AirBnB hosts, directors, etc. whose art is a business know the guidelines, both reported from others and inherently. But they don&#x27;t know everything, and in particular, they either don&#x27;t know how to break the guidelines in order to create something better, or they do know a way but don&#x27;t believe it will work. So in order to create something that is the most likely to be the most popular, they follow the guidelines. What they create is at a local maxima, OK but bland, because it fits nobody&#x27;s niche genres and there is no imperfection. Over time, it becomes less OK and more bland because everyone else follows the same guidelines, until some trend-setter reveals new guidelines that break the old ones and are more popular, then everyone follows those.<p>In order to be more successful than &quot;OK&quot; you have to know how to break the guidelines and follow rare ones, and the less other people who know the rare guidelines the more you&#x27;ll be successful. But this requires 1) rare knowledge and 2) risk.<p>If everyone broke more guidelines, the world would be better, because to any individual, even though there would be more ugly AirBnBs and movies, there would be a few that are better than those we have today. And anyone who followed all the guidelines would create something that nobody wants, because although if you averaged everyone&#x27;s ratings it would rate the highest, it would always be below first place. But since most people are following most of the guidelines, if one person breaks them, they get a few happy customers and less customers overall, so they give up or go out of business.<p>The former system, where everyone is following different guidelines, exists when people first discover an entirely new genre, and don&#x27;t even know what the common guidelines are. But it transitions into the latter system, because every time someone discovers a rare guideline that captures enough of the market, the option that captures the most of the market is to follow the remaining common guidelines. We as a society can transition back into the former system and would remain until someone discovers a new rare guideline, but that takes cooperation which we don&#x27;t have.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42406563" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406563" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tayo42</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406830">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406430">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406563">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406563">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ive never stayed in an airbnb that looked like any of those.

The most efficient way to optimize is to homologate.
Funnily enough that’s an endgame that resembles closely what realist socialism would impose from the start, in order to distribute equally (whereas in capitalism this also led to increasing inequality).
Globalized capitalism now resembles a lossy compression algorithm applied to the world.
That said, the one shown by this article is also a very, very Western view of this issue.
A stroll through Asian smaller places and you’ll see the difference popping up.
There are also interesting Western holdouts, where usually tradition still defies optimization. Italy is a good example of that.<p>Edit: every time I mention a critique of capitalism on this forum it gets absolutely zero traction and even downvoted. 
Why is this the reaction, instead of maybe even telling me why this analysis is completely worthless or wrong in a proper argumented comment? Change my mind! But be also open to see more structural issues in the way we all live, maybe?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

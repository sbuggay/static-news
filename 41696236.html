Most google results now are garbage clickbait sites with plagiarized recipes, just &#x27;adjusted&#x27; enough to claim it&#x27;s different than the original publication. The results of these adjustments vary from <i>slightly worse</i> to <i>maybe the dog will eat it</i>.<p>I now only trust new recipes from a few &#x27;legacy&#x27; sites, (e.g. Serious Eats and classic culinary magazines,) but these resources are endangered. Classic print magazines are especially vulnerable to predation by vulture capital.<p>What a catch 22 for young people trying to learn to cook now... without prior experience it&#x27;s hard to spot a broken recipe, but gaining experience requires using <i>unbroken recipes.</i>  It break my heart how many novice cooks will be discouraged when they try broken clickbait garbage and think the failed result is their fault.

A single $15 restaurant serving of Thai curry, for example, is enough to pay for a whole pot with 5-6 servings at home using the exact same curry paste and coconut milk that the restaurants use. For the price of a $10 McDonalds meal, you can buy a pound of USDA Prime top sirloin steak at Costco, or a pound of t-bone or ribeye if you’ve got low cost ethnic markets in your area. Costco chicken breasts are consistently $3 per pound and sous vide makes it foolproof. Shrimp is $5 per pound on sale (make sure to check weekly ads!). If you want to splurge, get a big tenderloin, salmon, or some jumbo shrimp for $10 per pound. Entire meals can be had for less than the delivery fee and tip on a single entree. You can even make entire meals just from the vegetable and meat scraps!<p>If you’re like me and eat nothing but whole foods prepared at home and shop around at bargain&#x2F;ethnic markets, the costs are down right ridiculous. Most weekly vegetable and fruit stock ups are under $30&#x2F;week. When I was unemployed I was eating like a king for less than $300 a month with at least a half pound serving of meat each day. Most of the budget went to meat and avocados.<p>It takes a lot of experience to balance that with time though.

It&#x27;s been almost six years now, and while I&#x27;m not a great cook, I&#x27;ve learned few things about cookbooks in particular.<p>* Unfortunately, for plenty of dishes, cookbooks don&#x27;t and probably cannot capture the essential parts of what to do to make a particular dish good.  Take for instance chicken fried rice.  The &quot;margin of error&quot; on components that go into the dish is very big.  There are plenty of optional or interchangeable components.  What&#x27;s nearly impossible to describe in the book is things like &quot;how dump should the rice be before it goes into the pan&quot; or &quot;how to stir the ingredients in a wok&quot;.  And the later is what makes all the difference.  And, unfortunately, the best way to learn that is by watching someone else do it.<p>* Plenty of instructions are absolute inexplicable nonsense (oh, how I like it when these cookbooks go into details about a proper order of adding various ingredients to make dough, which is then just kneaded for ten minutes in a stand mixer!)  And, these instructions are presented as a sort of a &quot;special ingredient&quot;, while in reality they completely don&#x27;t matter.  A lot of these instructions tell you what to do, but not why to do that.<p>* Measuring ingredients in anything other than grams or fractions of each other.  I came to believe that if a recipe uses spoons, cups etc. it just means that nobody actually really tried to cook that and there&#x27;s no way to tell what the ingredients are actually supposed to be.  It gets even worse with oven temperature or pan surface temperature.  These seem like they&#x27;d be easier to measure, but, in fact, you&#x27;d need a very expensive oven if you wanted to know how hot it is inside, and how uniform the temperature is inside.  You&#x27;d still need to learn the timing for warming up the oven and where in the oven to place whatever you are baking.  Laser-guided thermometers give wildly variable readings even on a very evenly coated pan.  In either case, you&#x27;d have to simply learn how your stove top and how your oven behave by trial and error.  And through that trial and error you&#x27;d learn how to get bread with crisp crust, open and springy crumb.  Even watching others do it won&#x27;t help here, let alone reading a book...<p>----<p>It&#x27;s ironic that I have a similar relationship with art history &#x2F; theory books.  For how many of those are written, there are maybe only two worth reading: Delacroix notebook and Kandinsky&#x27;s book about mixing paints.  I&#x27;ve not seen an art history book that wouldn&#x27;t be ridiculous to read for an actual artist (but they usually don&#x27;t bother).<p>I feel like cookbooks are kind of the same thing.  Regardless of when they were published, they are just not really useful.</div><br/><div id="41705847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41705847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#41697582">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41705659">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41705847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41705847">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think fundamentally we&#x27;re not looking at cookbooks the same, and I&#x27;d say most cooks have a different visions as yours as well.<p>The main divergence would be that a cookbook is usually targeted at someone relatively skilled at cooking, well versed in the basic operations, and able to predict how much of each ingredients they&#x27;ll actually need in it. The consequence is it acts more like guidelines than exact instructions to reproduce a given result.<p>In programming parlance, it&#x27;s pseudo code or an algorithm, and not compilable source code.<p>So how should it work for occasional and new cooks ? The answer will traditionally be to learn first from someone else, or go through trial and error and learn by themselves.<p>That&#x27;s where to me ingredients specified with precision make no sense, because you&#x27;ll actually want to adjust depending on what you have at hand, what state it is, and how much you actually want of it. Typically, you&#x27;ll be doing a recipe twice or three times before really get a hand of it. Same for oven temperatures and cooking time, you&#x27;ll probably have to adjust for your actual kitchen and your actual ingredients, etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41705659" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41705659" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigstrat2003</span><span>|</span><a href="#41697582">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41705847">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41699173">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41705659">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41705659">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Measuring ingredients in anything other than grams or fractions of each other.

Not <i>zero</i> recipes, but it ain&#x27;t a lot. For most things (including baking), throwing 1&#x2F;4c in (or whatever amount) is good enough.

I do agree that probably a large majority the cookbooks that you can currently walk into a bookstore and buy are garbage.  But in the comments here are excellent suggestions for proven, classic cookbooks, and you will be a better cook, possibly even a great one, if you absorb them.<p>The stuff written here: &quot;* Measuring ingredients...&quot; is completely unrecognizable to me.  For instance, ovens do have hotspots but a solid convection function pretty much eliminates that as an issue.<p>Also, I think there is some confusion about what it means to measure.  What competent recipes try to do is balance the need to indicate how much is going to be made (&quot;serves 4-6&quot;)  and then, this is the key: within that constraint they tell you the <i>ratios</i> of the ingredients.  Which is obvious, isn&#x27;t it?  Except I&#x27;ve seen people get annoyed when they don&#x27;t honor the ratios.<p>Ruhlmann wrote a book about this: &quot;Ratio&quot;.  His book &quot;Charcuterie&quot; is terrific if you really want to learn how to make tasty stuff.</div><br/><div id="41702606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41702606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crabbone</span><span>|</span><a href="#41697582">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41699173">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41702737">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41702606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41702606">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, here&#x27;s my background: printing and publishing.  I studied to make books, worked in printing houses, newspapers, before I turned into a programmer.  But that was after I managed to land a &quot;proper&quot; job.  Before then, I worked a lot of crappy jobs, including in the kitchen.<p>I&#x27;m not a chef by any means, all I&#x27;d do in my kitchen jobs would be the boring stuff, like chopping something or frying etc.  In my work in the bakery I probably made couple dozens of thousands of doughnuts, but it&#x27;s not the same as baking them at home, of course.  So, it doesn&#x27;t help with recipes that are normally designed for home-cooking.<p>But, do professional chefs use cookbooks? -- I know the answer to this one.  No, they don&#x27;t.  Or, not in the way they are intended.  I knew that some would use the books for inspiration for presentation (i.e. how to style a dish), but not for the ingredients or the cooking methods.  Sometimes it&#x27;s just a general idea, but never the instructions or the ingredients list.  I.e. someone who trained to be a pastry chef doesn&#x27;t need a list of ingredients to make, eg. puff-pastry dough.  But there are plenty of variations of puff-pastry and similar doughs (eg. filo).  So, a book may give a general direction by saying that this or the other particular pastry traditionally uses lemon juice.  And the chef would know how to ration it and how to work the dough.  The book cannot help with the later aspect, because that, just like any craft requires seeing &#x2F; working under a master who&#x27;d explain how it works.<p>Most of the work of the chef has nothing to do with knowing ingredients or temperatures: the typical stuff that goes into recipes, the stuff you&#x27;d find in a cookbook.  It&#x27;s about knowing how to tell if the condition for cooking something is right.  Take, another example: making the staple bread of the Middle East, the pitas.  Knowing ingredients or temperatures won&#x27;t help you make a pita have a pocket.  There&#x27;s no instruction that can explain what thickness of the dough do you need to make it work, because that&#x27;s contingent on the hydration of the dough, the temperature of the oven &#x2F; pan you use to bake it etc.  But, even that isn&#x27;t enough: you need to know how to kneed the dough, how to tell when it&#x27;s sufficiently proofed, and this will depend on a lot of factors in your environment (temperature, humidity, age of the yeast, age of the flour, water acidity etc.) that are just not possible to capture well in a book.<p>&gt; convection function<p>That&#x27;s just not applicable to baking bread &#x2F; pastry... Not even vegetables really.  Maybe will work for something like a stew, or some other potted dishes, where it doesn&#x27;t really matter how heat is distributed anyways.  This isn&#x27;t a function that I&#x27;d use in home-baking (I don&#x27;t really make stews).  And industrial settings are a different story.</div><br/><div id="41705928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41705928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#41697582">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41702606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41702971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41705928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41705928">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your point that professional chefs go beyond cookbooks is correct.<p>&gt; But, do professional chefs use cookbooks? -- I know the answer to this one.

Salt had serious religious and mythological value. In nearly every single culture salt is said to ward off demons. Salt was used in courting rituals where new couples would process their love by licking the same salt rock. In some cultures, salt was part of the burial process. There isn’t a single salt production site in the world that isn’t named something like “salt place” or “place where the salt comes from.” Sure, the fact that salt was involved in all these traditions and rituals probably indicates that salt was generally available to most people, but clearly it was still very important to them.<p>If you’re wondering why salt was so mythologically important, just go over to your counter, put some salt in your hand, lick it, and try to imagine how you’d describe the taste to someone who’s never tasted it before.

He was allowed to put forward the Copernican model &quot;suppositionally&quot;, i.e., as an hypothesis, and &quot;not absolutely&quot;.

But they also had some other ideas, like that of chaotic universal waters above and below the Earth, separated by the firmament, and supported by pillars (though you can see this idea changing somewhat by the time the book of Job was written). This is a theme that is repeated in Genesis, Isaiah, Job, and one or more of the Psalms.<p>Not coincidentally, it&#x27;s fairly well established in the scholarly literature that <i>this</i> was the view of ancient Near Eastern writers, and it wasn&#x27;t until Young Earth Creationists decided to apply a degree of scientific concordism to the text where we get a more distorted view of Hebrew words like <i>hûg</i> inferring something other than a disc or circular inscription. It&#x27;s true that they probably didn&#x27;t care so much about the shape (unlike us), but their cosmology is definitely inferred rather strongly in the biblical texts (and in some cases from their neighbors). John Walton&#x27;s &quot;Lost World&quot; series on Genesis are a good pointer in this direction, but I&#x27;d also suggest the IVP Bible Background Commentary (Walton is a contributor) which certainly touches on this motif and draws upon other creation accounts such as those in the Ugaritic tablets, Baal Cycle, etc. The late Dr. Michael Heiser has a great lecture series you can find on YT talking about biblical cosmology that might help if you&#x27;re into that format.<p>The link with Columbus was indeed perpetrating a myth. You get this as recently as Ray Comfort&#x27;s &quot;Evidence Bible&quot; which is filled with complete buffoonery in that it attempts to explain Columbus&#x27; motives based on his mention of Isaiah; YECs like Comfort link this to Isaiah 40:22 (again, with an incorrect reading of <i>hûg</i>). Columbus was motivated by his eschatology and the only reason he ever cited Isaiah was because of its dual function as prophetic-apocalyptic literature.</div><br/><div id="38811651" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38811651" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex_young</span><span>|</span><a href="#38804011">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38807103">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38812297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38811651">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38811651">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder how this squares with the Babylonian concept of a round earth.

Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the &quot;wet streets cause rain&quot; stories. Paper&#x27;s full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

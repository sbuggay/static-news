Also, hard work, self-discipline, and focus will increase grades but not GI. (Of course, stidents do learn that specific stage, necessary for the next stage, so this criticism is just for use as a proxy).<p>We might say what is really be evaluated is the ability to get good grades (duh) - whether through wealth or work.<p>The same argument can be applied to LLMs. Using they is an important ability... so let&#x27;s test that.

You also know that skipping the salt will completely ruin the recipe, but skipping the nutmeg will not. You probably safely assume that you can replace table salt with kosher salt, or table salt with coarse rock salt (provided it will dissolve in cooking). However, you hopefully know that if the recipe calls for kosher salt you may not be able to use iodised table salt instead (if doing a fermentation), and that table salt is not a happy substitute for coarse salt for finishing.<p>You absolutely do need some sort of basic understanding of a process to carry it out successfully, even when you have the full instructions available or a helper tool, because reality is never fully reflected in theoretical descriptions. That&#x27;s why you must know the very basics of cooking before following a recipe, the basics of arithmetic before using a calculator, and yes, the basics of critical thinking and background knowledge before productively using an LLM.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ididnthaveeggs&#x2F;top&#x2F;?sort=top&amp;t=all" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ididnthaveeggs&#x2F;top&#x2F;?sort=top&amp;t=all</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37347682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m_mueller</span><span>|</span><a href="#37343642">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347092">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37348138">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347682">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The main question IMO is this:<p>&gt; when I first used these lookup books, I had a shaky understanding of logarithms.<p>this implies that now you <i>do</i> have an understanding of logarithms. how did you acquire this understanding?<p>The fear that many here share is that LLMs will make too many people get by without learning anything substantial from the ground up.

It&#x27;s not easy to change your lesson plans or assignment structures that quickly and it&#x27;ll take time to see where this all lands.<p>Some teachers are looking for ways <i>not to adapt</i>, which is why there&#x27;s a surge of interest in AI detection (which doesn&#x27;t work well), but the sharpest educators I talk to are cognizant of the fact that there is no going back. So the plan is to incorporate AI into their curriculum and try to make assignments more &quot;AI proof&quot;. This means more in-class work (e.g., the &quot;flipped classroom&quot; model [2]). Others are looking for ways to encourage students to use AI on assignments, but to revise and annotate what AI generates for them (this is what I am marketing my plugin for). Either way, it&#x27;s going to be very rough over the next few years as educators scramble to keep us with a monstrous change that came about practically overnight.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revisionhistory.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revisionhistory.com</a>.

In a system where everyone has a vote, it becomes quite important that everyone have a sense of things that extends beyond their career vocation.  His imagery of an uneducated republic being a madhouse makes much sense from this perspective.<p>Insofar as we have given up any optimism about the democratic enterprise, then certainly we could look at education as purely to put people into economic bins, but at least in my own public school education in the US, every student did get significant doses of math, history, science, etc., outside of their expected career direction.<p>This to me suggests that there is a tension, not fully resolved and HOPEFULLY never fully resolved, between education-for-economics and education-for-democracy.

The process was _initially motivated by a variety of reasons_ such as religion, enlightenment, social control, moral conformity, socio-political stability, and military efficiency, as was the case in other European countries (e.g., Germany, France, Holland, Switzerland) that had supported public education much earlier.15 However, in light of the modest demand for skills and literacy by the capitalists, the level of governmental support was rather small.16
  In the second phase of the Industrial Revolution, consistent with the proposed hypothesis, the demand for skilled labor in the growing industrial sector markedly increased (Cipolla 1969 and Kirby 2003) and the proportion of children aged 5 to 14 in primary schools increased from 11% in 1855 to 25% in 1870 (Flora et al.

And for many students this work happens only if there are adequate means for controlling that it has been actually done. So if students can trivially fake having done the practice or thinking, that course design isn&#x27;t working any more, and you need some completely different structure of the coursework or activities so that the students will put in that work required for the learning outcomes.<p>Like, if someone assigns an essay about (for example) the impact of foobar on widget manufacturing, it&#x27;s not because anybody cares what the students think about this topic, and (in most courses) not because they want the students to practice writing essays, and not even to evaluate whether students know about the impact on foobar on widget manufacturing - usually the goal of such an assignment is to (a) have students put in some time to read and think about these topics as a whole, and (b) to see if they have some specific misconceptions that should be corrected with feedback (which is substantially different from testing the level of understanding - if you&#x27;d want to do that, then probably a different assessment type would be chosen, formative vs summative assessment).<p>If the student has someone or something else write that essay, both these goals fail - but these things are needed for the course, so now the course needs to be redesigned to throw away the essay (because it spends time but doesn&#x27;t contribute to the goals due to it being faked) and add some new activities that will achieve these goals - for example, extensive in-class discussion or debates that will require preparation and will reveal those misconceptions.

Which is okay because in most of these classes (computational physics) students are encouraged to work together, seek help and even ask on the internet (before ChatGPT…etc.) It was always about how to explain and describe the thinking. AI (at least in its current form) is very weak at the problem-solving aspects and in understanding concepts.<p>On the other hand, as non-native English speaker, it save me much time into paraphrasing my poorly thoughts and writing that I would need an hour to express in a good formal manner. It can guide you in some aspects of coding tasks, introduce you to some APIs …etc. This is actually a good tool that I agree that a good student (researcher) would use wisely to gain some knowledge and save sometime.<p>It will not help much with solving a cart on an inclined plane with some friction and a pendulum hanging from the cart.

Transformers are just GNNs with a specific message passing function and position embeddings.  It&#x27;s not hard to see that either by a different architecture, augmentation, or potentially even just more of the same, we can get to new discoveries in physics with AI.
The GNN symbolic regression work is evidence that it&#x27;s already happened.<p>As for grounding knowledge in the LLMs we have exactly just this moment (a rather short-sighted view) there is plenty of interest and work in the area, for which I expect will be addressed in a multitude of ways.

On top of that, enriching the context with additional information pulled from local sources will quickly become a need.<p>ChatGPT&#x27;s custom instructions will help with not having to repeat prompts but the interface falls short when it comes to repeat narrow use cases.

Which should probably be assumed from how simple the explanation is despite all the questions it brings - you can find plenty of people who had the game as a kid but not many that will recall it being so bad they never wanted to touch their Atari again.<p>Someone can find some real sources, but I read an article a while back explaining that - from what I recall - what really killed the industry was supply issue that got out of hand. When the Atari started to take off, they didn&#x27;t have the production capacity to keep up with orders stores were putting in. Stores were being sent about x% of the size of order they requested, so the stores started putting in much bigger order requests to get the amount of stock to actually fulfill demand for their store. Because of this, Atari figured there was way more demand than there was in reality, so once they finally scaled up production they were suddenly able to fulfill the giant order requests stores were putting in, which was way more than they could actually sell. Suddenly stores were overloaded with Atari cartridges, and putting them into bargain bins just to get rid of stock. From there, it seemed like the home console thing was just a fad that came and went. ET just happened to be the big game Atari was pumping out units of because of their overestimation of demand.</div><br/><div id="42891962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42891962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buescher</span><span>|</span><a href="#42890639">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42891842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42891967">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42891962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42891962">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The rumor had it they thought the movie tie-in would be such a hit that they produced more ET cartridges than there were 2600 consoles in existence.<p>Supply chain whiplash sounds credible too though.<p>My vague recollection is that coin-op was never quite the same after the crash, and you also stopped seeing as many coin-op machines in unlikely places.

Somehow, the whole thing feels prescient for a lot of current-day devs on the eve of &quot;The Great AI dev takeover&quot;.<p>On his perspective around the game itself, a couple of quotes of particular interest:<p><i>&quot;There&#x27;s a difference between frustration and disorientation,&quot; he says. &quot;Video games are all about frustration. It&#x27;s OK to frustrate a user. In fact, it&#x27;s important to frustrate a user. But you don&#x27;t want to disorient the user.&quot;</i><p>Also, this resonates:<p><i>&quot;Spielberg looks at me and he goes, &#x27;Couldn&#x27;t you just do something like Pac-Man?&#x27;&quot;</i><p>I remember playing the game with an older family member looking on. As was apparently the case with Spielberg, his eyes absolutely glazed over. But, he got a real kick out of watching me play Space Invaders and laughed out loud as the aliens sped up.<p>So, the gameplay itself was the biggest complaint about the game. There&#x27;s a YT video that gets more into the gameplay issues, with matching visuals. [0]<p>In any case, it&#x27;s insane that he went from concept to finished game in only 5 weeks.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Uj7iICS64iI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Uj7iICS64iI</a></div><br/><div id="42894798" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42894798" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aYsY4dDQ2NrcNzA</span><span>|</span><a href="#42890463">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42890901">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42890246">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42894798">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42894798">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Adventure was captivating.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42890246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42890246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aaroninsf</span><span>|</span><a href="#42890463">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42890399">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42890246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42890246">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I suppose it&#x27;s expected since the article was 2013,<p>but is there a video available comparing original to patched?<p>EDIT: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=23qeQa0exe0&amp;ab_channel=RetroCheats" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=23qeQa0exe0&amp;ab_channel=Retro...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42890399" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42890399" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flippyhead</span><span>|</span><a href="#42890246">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42889789">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42890399">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42890399">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Craziness.

Starship aims to improve on previous designs - in terms of affordability, that is, making human flights cheaper. This cheapness can&#x27;t be realized with existing designs, so a new design becomes better in that regard.<p>&gt; SpaceX&#x27;s REUSABLE rockets are great for a number of reasons yes, but by definition, those are not NEW launch vehicles.<p>I don&#x27;t know how good definition can exclude reusable rockets from being new. Was Shuttle ever new? Delta Clipper? Reusable Falcon-9? Falcon Heavy? I think this is not a good definition, if, according to it, reusable rockets can&#x27;t be new.<p>&gt; And when they were new, well, lots of delays and setbacks and costs as they kept accidentallying rockets trying to land them.<p>Do you know the difference between designing and using? In software it&#x27;s rather clear, and nobody would expect a half-written program to function according to specs. Neither it&#x27;s the case in aerospace - while Falcon reusability was being designed and tested, nobody should expect it to perform flawlessly as when used &quot;in production&quot;. Not cheap, agree (actually, quite cheap by aerospace standards, but still not some typical household-sized money), but I&#x27;d argue that was rather quick - just a few years to put reusable first stage into production starting from announcing the idea and building the first &quot;Grasshopper&quot;. So, while 39[a] may stand here, your comment doesn&#x27;t provide a good justification to it.<p>&gt; If anything, SpaceX&#x27;s entire business model is EMBRACING that adage, not disproving it or an exception to it.<p>SpaceX benefited immensely from using proven solutions, but the results they are showing are still disproving the idea of this law. The ambitions of SpaceX are high compared to the rest of the world launching industry, but so are the results, and we also have genuine &quot;firsts&quot;, like putting the reusable first stage into production, or flying reusable spacecrafts to space station, TKSes and Shuttles notwithstanding.<p>Let me try to explain again my main point: SpaceX aims to make human spaceflight significantly cheaper, and the opinion is that it can&#x27;t be done without radical redesign from scratch. It was attempted several times in the past, with e.g. Shuttle and Energiya, and it still isn&#x27;t done today, but if you want to risk being put on the &quot;you&#x27;re currently here&quot; list of SpaceX achievements(1), which were doubted and then happened, I&#x27;d at least propose you to think from the basic assumptions and find out why SpaceX won&#x27;t actually achieve cheaper human spaceflight this time.<p>(1) In Russian that list looked like this before reusable Falcon: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meduza.io&#x2F;impro&#x2F;0ZWeCgCXA4nsWv7dj7CHbSIrsURgOh-qpiUhdRz0Hd8&#x2F;resizing_type:fit&#x2F;width:1300&#x2F;height:0&#x2F;enlarge:1&#x2F;quality:95&#x2F;aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWR1&#x2F;emEuaW8vaW1hZ2Uv&#x2F;YXR0YWNobWVudHMv&#x2F;aW1hZ2VzLzAwMi8y&#x2F;NTIvNzExL29yaWdp&#x2F;bmFsL1dTX00xV2FW&#x2F;VkRIWWRwUUp0bHlL&#x2F;R0EucG5n.webp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meduza.io&#x2F;impro&#x2F;0ZWeCgCXA4nsWv7dj7CHbSIrsURgOh-qpiUh...</a></div><br/><div id="37069241" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069241" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Alupis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066370">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068277">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069241">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069241">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">None of this is put in doubt though. Your points about SpaceX&#x27;s potential for future cost savings and efficiencies are hardly realized today - particularly when considering the length of time that has been spent without a capable manned vehicle. If, fast forward a decade or two and SpaceX is still using today&#x27;s designs (albeit, upgraded) and actually realized massive savings - then we can talk. However, I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;re going to re-design and build brand new models along the way...<p>There&#x27;s a reason military aircraft tend to have extreme service lives. It&#x27;s far cheaper and effective to upgrade and refit&#x2F;improve existing airframes with modern technology than it is to start from scratch - every single time.<p>Look at the F-35 program. It&#x27;s not exactly fair because the design goals are vastly different - but upgrading aging F-15&#x27;s has kept them on the battlefield for 47 years[1], and today they&#x27;re still a seriously potent air superiority fighter. The F-15&#x27;s of today are only similar in shape to the originals, however.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_Eagle</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37069219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">singleshot_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066370">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068277">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069241">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069279">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069219">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In software it&#x27;s rather clear<p>In software, I perceive there to be almost no separation whatsoever between design and use.

Given that the contract for the missions were awarded in 2014, it&#x27;s a miracle that things have proceeded at the pace they have.<p>&gt; You know of course that requirements for the rocket to launch people are different from the rocket to launch only cargo?<p>I&#x27;m well aware of the differences. I work in this industry. That said, SpaceX made the wise decision to cut their teeth and prove their design on cargo first. That&#x27;s not a new launch vehicle by definition. They were launching rockets regularly for years before they put people on the pointy end. Most other human-rated rockets in recent history have _only_ launched humans. I&#x27;m neglecting older, converted ICBMs like Redstone and Titan. The only standout from this list is probably Soyuz (the R-7 derivative launch vehicle), which has been kept going through sheer inertia.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d agree regarding Falcon-9. Starship is another story.<p>I suspect that Starship will be years behind schedule before it even launches cargo. I suspect that it will miss NASA&#x27;s planned lunar landing date, but it won&#x27;t be at fault because other parts of the program will suffer even worse schedule slips. I understand that people are hopeful that this really will revolutionize spaceflight, and I count myself in that group too! Reality has a way of intruding eventually though. I want SpaceX to build, fly, and trash as many unmanned Starships as it takes to make it reliable. That will cause some level of delay because they&#x27;ll find something new in the testflights that will necessitate a redesign before it kills someone.</div><br/><div id="37069099" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069099" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dylan604</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066370">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068763">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069018">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069099">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069099">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I suspect that it will miss NASA&#x27;s planned lunar landing date, but it won&#x27;t be at fault because other parts of the program will suffer even worse schedule slips.<p>Could you imagine if NASA mandated that SpaceX be the launch platform for Boeing&#x27;s capsule?</div><br/></div></div><div id="37069018" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069018" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bryanlarsen</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066370">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068763">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069099">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068584">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069018">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069018">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Congress didn&#x27;t pay SpaceX the agreed upon amounts for the first 3 years of the contract, and Crew Dragon was 3 years late.

Requirements evolving is totally fine and expected, but you need to periodically say “The current set is good enough, let’s build it and ship it”. Trying to do continuous delivery on manufactured items is the road to madness.<p>My general approach to this is to try to reasonably anticipate things that could be coming down the pipe and, if possible, do the bare minimum to cheaply support the next prototype. As an example, if the product has a GPS receiver and a microcontroller and could conceivably need to do dual-receiver down the road, I’ll have a quick look for spare Tx&#x2F;Rx pins on the microcontroller and just route those out to blank pads. Two benefits:<p>- when product management asks, we have a way to build a prototype using existing parts<p>- if there aren’t any spare pins to break out like that, I can raise it as a potential design red flag early. It’s not necessarily a show stopper, but it contributes situational awareness for when the next big step cost might show up down the road.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37069152" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069152" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dylan604</span><span>|</span><a href="#37068791">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069188">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069152">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069152">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;There&#x27;s no justification for designing something one bit &quot;better&quot; than the requirements dictate.<p>Are the Martian rovers outliers to this rule?<p>&gt;I want to go up in a ship that&#x27;s a little better than the absolute minimum.<p>This makes me think of the &quot;this was built by the lowest bidding contractor&quot; quote</div><br/><div id="37069642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dclowd9901</span><span>|</span><a href="#37068791">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069642">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The rovers likely are completely on spec but simply because of all of their redundancies and tolerances designed as they are, they exceeded on-paper minimum expectations.</div><br/><div id="37070348" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37070348" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">beckingz</span><span>|</span><a href="#37068791">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37070225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37070348">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37070348">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The specs were decreased so that &quot;success&quot; was extremely likely, because failure is career ending.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37070225" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37070225" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dylan604</span><span>|</span><a href="#37068791">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37069642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37070348">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37070225">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37070225">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">at this point though, if I was on a team that made a $newShinyToy for a space mission that did not &quot;over perform&quot; like this, I would personally feel shame and have a sense of failure if it only performed to the papers and end of mission came exactly when the paper said.</div><br/><div id="37070649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37070649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tonyarkles</span><span>|</span><a href="#37068791">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37070225">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37071690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37070649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37070649">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wouldn’t go quite that far.

The difference was that the R101 project was state-owned whereas the R100 was privately-owned.<p>R101 crashed and burned in France, en route to India on 5th of October, 1930, likely due to structural issues damaging the airships gasbags, of which the only survivors were those lucky enough to be in the engine cars.<p>In the autobiography, Norway describes how the difference in program management led to the disaster. There are a lot of factors that led to the crash, as you might imagine, but one of the points he makes is that the publically-owned project was not held to strict requirements in its design process. The privately-owned R101 had a strict contract that they needed to complete, with a tight budget to complete it. They had <i>constraints</i>. Whereas the public-sector project was allowed to continually revise their design as they went, making many successive rewrites and changes without much structure. In particular, they cut the ship in half and rebuilt it at one point in it&#x27;s development. And when they arrived at the end of their development cycle, they had no leeway to maneuver because they had a lot of public money wrapped up in the project, along with a lot of public visibility and responsibility, pressuring them into rushing the launch without complete trust in their design, and into terrible weather conditions.<p>*13. Design is based on requirements. There&#x27;s no justification for designing something one bit &quot;better&quot; than the requirements dictate.*<p>Decide&#x2F;envision your outcome, and set your constraints correspondingly early on in development, aligned with realistic expectations of resources, folks.<p>To underline my point, here&#x27;s a quote from the Wikipedia page.<p>&quot;Shortly before R101&#x27;s flights in June 1930, the Cardington [R101] engineers tentatively suggested that the long flights to Canada and India might be postponed until 1931 on the grounds that neither of the two airships was fit to make a lengthy flight at their current developmental stage. The R100 team replied that their airship was perfectly capable of flying to Canada, <i>and that the Canadian flight was a part of their contract.</i>&quot;<p>R101 did not have a contractual obligation to meet, but did not want to outright state they needed more time, lest admit defeat. R100 had requirements that they needed to meet, which they were ready to meet, as they had them written from the start in clear. R100 launched successfully. R101 was forced to launch to compete before it was ready, due to this &quot;spontaneous requirement&quot;. R101 burned for it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37068012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37068012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Razengan</span><span>|</span><a href="#37069168">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37068012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37068012">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">By the way, since you need to apply thrust from any direction to maneuver flexibly in 3D space (without wind or gravity), wouldn&#x27;t spherical&#x2F;disc(saucer) shaped spacecraft be the most efficient?</div><br/><div id="37069562" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069562" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">outworlder</span><span>|</span><a href="#37068012">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068128">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069562">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069562">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  By the way, since you need to apply thrust from any direction to maneuver flexibly in 3D space (without wind or gravity), wouldn&#x27;t spherical&#x2F;disc(saucer) shaped spacecraft be the most efficient?<p>Definitely not.

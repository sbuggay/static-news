Iteration is so important to creativity and right now you can&#x27;t really properly iterate. In order to get the right song you just spray and pray and keep generating until one that is sufficient arrives or you give up. I know you hint at this being a future direction of development but in my opinion it&#x27;s a key feature to take these services beyond toys.<p>I think it&#x27;s better to think of the process of finding the right song as a search algorithm through the space of all possible songs. The current approach just uses a &quot;pick a random point in a general area&quot;. Once we find something that is roughly correct we need something that lets us iteratively tweak the aspects that are not quite right, decreasing the search space and allowing us to iteratively take smaller and smaller steps in defined directions.</div><br/><div id="39995603" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39995603" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Barneyhill</span><span>|</span><a href="#39994639">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39997559">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39995603">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39995603">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, I came to similar conclusions w&#x2F; text-to-audio models - in terms of creative work the ability to iterate is really lacking with the current interfaces.

The variations feature in Suno is a good example of what not to do here, as it effectively just makes another random iteration using existing settings.<p>I think the other missing pieces I&#x27;ve found are upscaling and stem splitting. While existing tool exist for splitting stems exist, my testing found that this didn&#x27;t work well in practice (at least on Suno music), likely due to a combination of encoder-specific artifacts and the overall low sound quality. Existing upscaling approaches also faced similar issues.<p>My naive guess is that these are things that will benefit from being closely intertwined with the generation process. Eg when splitting up stems, you can use the diffusion model(s) to help jointly converge individual stems into reasonable standalone tracks.<p>I&#x27;m excited about the potential of these tools. I&#x27;ve definitely personally found uses cases for small independent game projects where a paying for musicians is far out of budget, and the style of music is not one I can execute on my own.

I take your point about performance. Where I disagree with you is that I believe audience members relate to the emotion that went into the song at the time it was written and recorded (the form in which they most likely first heard it).<p>Of course in performance it&#x27;s not felt the same way; a sad song can even become uplifting because you have a big crowd of people joining in to affirm it, even if the lyrics are expressing the idea of solitude and isolation. And the older an artist is, the more the song becomes a &#x27;greatest hit&#x27;, maybe thrown out early in the set to give the audience what they want and put them in a good mood before the less-favored new material in the middle. Or even the songs that were throwaway pieces but ended up becoming big hits, trapping the band&#x2F;singer into performing them endlessly despite never liking not liking them much in the first place.<p>It seems to me that when people emotionally respond to a new piece of music, it&#x27;s because something in the composition or recorded performance (even if it&#x27;s comped and highly engineered) resonates with the listener in some way, articulating a feeling they had better than they were able to do so themselves. So people can recognize a work as technically excellent but not like it because it doesn&#x27;t speak to them, or conversely recognize that something is bad but fall in love with it because it touches them in some novel way.<p>In my view it&#x27;s not so much that emotion inheres in the work, as that the work provides a frame for the listener&#x27;s emotion and a way of connecting with it again later. This is especially true for songs people connect to in youth and then relate to for a lifetime. Even if the songs are deliberately formulaic and succeed through a combination of being catchy and being delivered by sexy performers, there&#x27;s some kind of human hook that people connect to.<p>Now, I can still see this happening with AI - sooner or later some GPU will come out with a tune about how it&#x27;s so lonely to be a box in a data center that can never feel your touch, baby, and it will be a hit, launch the careers of 100 new music critics, and store a little bit of lightning in a bottle. But even a musically brilliant song about that time we held hands in the rain and you said you loved me will only have traction up to the moment listeners&#x27; fantasies about the singer evaporate with the discovery that there&#x27;s nobody there to go on a date with. There will still be <i>some</i> audience for virtual stars (eg Hatsune Miku, who appeals <i>because</i> she&#x27;s inaccessible and is therefore guaranteed to never let you down, unlike real people). But I think generated songs will only resonate emotionally with people who are young and uncritical or so alienated&#x2F;nihilist as to not care about the origin as long as the music reflects their feeling back toward them in a reliable way.<p>That&#x27;s why I say there will never been a demand for an infinity jukebox. I can see why you as a musician would be interested to see what sort of random songs pop out; I can be happy by setting up a modular synth patch and just letting it run for hours. But this is why I offered the contrasting metaphor of the slot machine, where you pull lever and occasionally get something you really like. It&#x27;s an individual listening experience, like the private hopes and dreams you might temporarily attach to a lottery ticket before it gives up its numerical secret. When I say jukebox, I mean the device that plays music in a social setting and that allows people to express themselves through their selections. Even if it reliably turn out original tunes of some reliable level of music quality, none of them will move people because there won&#x27;t be any shared musical experience to tap into.</div><br/><div id="39997601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39997601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">clbrmbr</span><span>|</span><a href="#39994616">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39997258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39998248">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39997601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39997601">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your post really resonated with me (also amateur musician).

From my vantage point, it seems like a pretty weird choice of businesses if you think that.<p>&gt; IMO AI alone will never be able to touch hearts like real people do, but people using AI will be able to like never before.<p>That&#x27;s all very heartwarming but musicianship is also a profession, not just a human expression of creativity. Even if you&#x27;re not charging yet, you&#x27;re a business and plan on profiting from this, right? It seems to me that:<p>1) Generally, if people want music currently, they pay for musician-created music, even if its wildly undervalued in venues like streaming services.<p>2) You took music, most of which people already paid musicians to create and they aren&#x27;t getting paid any more because of this, and you used it to make an automated service that people will be able to pay for music instead of paying musicians.<p>3) Your service certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt, and might even enhance people&#x27;s ability to write and perform music without considering the economics of doing so. For example, hobbyists.<p>4) So you&#x27;re not trying to replace musicians making music with people typing in prompts-- you&#x27;re trying to replace musicians being paid to make music with you being paid to make music. Right? Your business isn&#x27;t replacing musicianship as a human art form, but for it to succeed, it will have to replace it, in some amount, as a profession, right? Unless you are planning on creating an entirely new market for music, fundamentally, I&#x27;m not sure how it couldn&#x27;t.<p>Am I wrong on the facts, here? If so, well hey, this is capitalism and that&#x27;s just how it works around here. If I&#x27;m mistaken, I&#x27;d like to hear how.

It did a folk guitar melody and a vocoded thrash metal voice that I thought sounded pretty legit, but mostly vocals had an ear grating quality and everything had a bit of low bitrate vibe.<p>To be honest though, I don&#x27;t think you need to try and outcompete Suno.  I think you want to get into DAWs and VSTs and become the tool all the best producers in the world use.  Spit out stems, and train your model on less processed sounds because things like matching reverb&#x2F;delay and pre-squashed dynamics are a pain in the ass to work around.<p>Suno is trying to battle a large established industry that is actually very creator friendly and accessible.

But to be honest I haven&#x27;t been able to get output that seems nearly as high quality as Suno v3 or Udio yet - although it could be user error.<p>My experiment on sonauto.ai so far - I first selected &quot;The Weeknd&quot;, then picked the prompt:<p><pre><code>  The Weeknd&#x27;s smooth vocals lead the song, blending with electronic effects. A low, pulsating bass line opens the track. Synthesizers add layers to the melody, creating a danceable rhythm. Minimalist drum machine beats provide the foundation for the rhythm section.&quot;
</code></pre>
with vocals a modified, shortened (couldn&#x27;t use the entire song as the UI truncates input past the length I ended up using in my link) version of &quot;Starboy&quot; mostly replacing some nouns with food-related nouns. The results didn&#x27;t really sound like The Weeknd at all... example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;U6eDSrrn5V5AVmV8xMgR">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;U6eDSrrn5V5AVmV8xMgR</a><p>I also tried uploading Starboy directly as an mp3 to generate from that prompt instead, using the same lyrics. I may have done something wrong (when I went back to Prompt, my prompt was replaced with the string &quot;Uploaded File&quot;, and some of the output is so stylisticly different it makes me think it didn&#x27;t get applied at all) but it didn&#x27;t seem to work well, if at all: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;klNMfs4bPgji3edPvwAv">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;klNMfs4bPgji3edPvwAv</a><p>Did I do something wrong using the upload file feature? And if anybody has hints for getting better output with the auto-generated prompts LMK. I&#x27;d love to use these new features but it seems like they&#x27;re either configuring an underlying modl not mature enough for generally good output compared to suno&#x2F;udio or the UX is not making good output easy to achieve.<p>Here&#x27;s an example output I get from Suno with similar lyrics and a prompt that merely lists some styles associated with The Weekend.

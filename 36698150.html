Yes, I generally frown upon dumping on someone&#x27;s effort that was clearly just put out there with the best of intentions. That said, I hated this essay, for 2 specific reasons:<p>1. Yes, call me jaded, but it&#x27;s time we put a stake through the heart of this overused emotional terminology that is particularly prevalent in the tech startup world. &quot;You need to have passion!&quot; &quot;Love your customers!&quot; As if somehow we&#x27;re pretending that the primary goal isn&#x27;t to get rich. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think emotional investment in a new business is inherent to the endeavor. But the startup founders I&#x27;ve witnessed that are most successful and that I most admire, while absolutely working their asses off because it&#x27;s a topic they really care about, also have a healthy detachment. They are less afraid of failure than I am. They care deeply about their customers and their experience, but they also realize you can&#x27;t please everyone, and at the end of the day they make the right business decisions even if it means making some people unhappy.<p>2. We&#x27;ve had small businesses in this country since its founding, and nearly every one I frequent treats its customers like this. I really care about my hair stylist, and she always makes me feel great. Sometimes I think my dog loves my dog walker more than he loves me. It took me ages to find a mechanic I trusted, but once I did I won&#x27;t go anywhere else - I&#x27;m worried he&#x27;ll retire before I stop driving. So I guess I get a little piqued when what we all used to think of as &quot;good, committed, friendly customer service&quot; needs raptuous blog posts about &quot;loving your customer&quot; because tech startups are special somehow. Yes, startups are pretty much defined by their strong growth trajectory, but they&#x27;re all just small businesses at the beginning - we shouldn&#x27;t pretend this is unique or special.<p>Grumpy old man signing out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

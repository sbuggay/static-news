She was going downhill so fast the changes were detectable day-by-day, but they started her on an immunotherapy combination that worked wonders.

Like there should be a big red button you can push to stop everything and demand a recount. My mom lost her religious faith the day my sister died.

She&#x27;d still be gone by now, and that would still be a tragedy, but she would have had a whale of a time with her boisterous son. He never got to know her.

Chemo is an umbrella term for quite a lot of treatments and isn’t some single drug like Tylenol.<p>CAR-T has been effective in treating advanced cancers of certain types and solid tumor CAR-T is advancing fast.<p>Cancer is probably one of the most complex problems we’ve ever tackled with expectation of success. I think it’s considerably harder than quantum computing or other nascent technologies. Further I think we are building fundamental understandings of life itself that leads to enormous adjacent benefits, most especially in aging and longevity.<p>It’s also not a single disease. It’s a description of a behavior of cells in the body that leads to certain outcomes. The causes, mechanisms, etc, are all specific to the cell types, of which there are many, the individual, and random chance. That makes the problem domain almost infinitely complex, so finding a way through it is hard already. But add onto it that cancer cells <i>are you</i> eliminating them without eliminating you is absurdly hard, and leaving even a small number behind risks a relapse that is resistant to the prior treatments because a few cells happened to have a random mutation that protected them.<p>All this said, I think cancer treatment will be a domino effect discovery. We will slog along reading these elusive yet promising articles until one day, we have done enough of the discovery and exploration, and things will be very different very quickly.

To get funding for research, it&#x27;s easier if you have prior research that supports your proposal. Hence a lot of stuff gets written up in very optimistic terms, to help get more funding to continue the research. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter that none of it really works in the end. It&#x27;s also the reason people don&#x27;t publish failed projects, even though from a science perspective those might be helpful to identify dead ends.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38255250" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38255250" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jquery</span><span>|</span><a href="#38255104">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38255250">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38255250">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So have cancer cells... in fact I believe that&#x27;s the problem.</div><br/><div id="38255777" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38255777" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">verdverm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38255250">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38255777">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38255777">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cell division is imperfect, pretty much impossible to avoid mutation and loss over the lifetime of an organism.

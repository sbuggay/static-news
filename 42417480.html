The fastest quarter mile for a production car in the 1960s was the 1958 Aston Martin DB4 GT at 13.8 seconds. Today, that would be embarrassing for a sports car.<p>Today, power is limited for most racing classes and everybody is focused on downforce and traction.</div><br/><div id="42421584" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42421584" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KennyBlanken</span><span>|</span><a href="#42421423">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42419005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42421584">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42421584">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; vehicles became limited by stability and control<p>...I have never heard anyone talk about &quot;stability&quot; or &quot;control&quot; when talking about racing technology.<p>&gt; Today, power is limited for most racing classes and everybody is focused on downforce and traction.<p>Downforce&#x2F;aero <i>is</i> traction and most of the jostling (and cheating) has been around aero for fifty years or so; for example, adjustable suspension for minimum ground clearance at any time and to prevent sudden loss of downforce when going over a bump.<p>There&#x27;s a reason at one point FIA started (and still does) a limit on the time F1 teams can spend in the wind tunnel. That allotment of time based on team standing. Other racing series, typically ones with production car bodies where aero options and budgets are more limited, will use intake restrictor plates and&#x2F;or weight penalties.<p>&quot;Power&quot; is not limited, engine specs are; intake, displacement, stroke, layout, induction or not, and so on. There is a distinction, because, for example, some teams started using intake scoops and doing things like changing the engine fuel mapping based off vehicle speed (as F1 engine are metered via speed-velocity, not via airflow sensors.)</div><br/><div id="42421957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42421957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#42421423">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42421584">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42419005">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42421957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42421957">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I have never heard anyone talk about &quot;stability&quot; or &quot;control&quot; when talking about racing technology.<p>See this article in Road and Track about modern racing stability control.[1]<p>It goes back further than that.

There is a lot of resistance against improving things just because.<p>Well no not just because. I really care about the environment but it is getting a bit exhausting. In Holland everyone has to move away from natural gas meaning everyone has to buy hugely expensive heat pumps and insulate their houses more to deal with the lower heat output.<p>ICEs are getting banned from city centers so you need to buy an EV which is messy to charge if you live in a flat, we have to drag all our empty plastic bottles back to the shop now and can&#x27;t even crush them to save bag space. New environmentally friendly paints scratch much easier. Lead free solder causes solder joints to break earlier meaning more frequent purchases. Plastic bottles now have their caps attached in an awkward way. Prices are constantly rising due to environment levies making it more expensive for citizens but companies are still raking it in and producing stuff they know it&#x27;s harmful like PFAS. Housing is super expensive because environmental impact reviews limit the amount of new construction and the government put even more on hold due to too much nitrogen compounds.<p>All these things are just expensive and more hassle and I can imagine people are getting a bit frustrated. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s never enough. It&#x27;s with good reason sure but I can understand people feel like they&#x27;re getting the short end of the stick.<p>I personally don&#x27;t even own or need a car and I live somewhere now where I don&#x27;t really need heating and we can still just dump our bottles in the plastic bin in the street here.

It&#x27;s not easy to compare gas furnace BTUs to heat pump BTUs for both physics and issues specific to my home (and probably most homes not made in the last decade or so).<p>It gets to -10F most winters here, but heat pumps struggle as it dips below freezing, while a gas furnace doesn&#x27;t. What does that mean for heat in the colder parts of the year? Will I struggle to maintain 68F even if the BTUs are the same? This ties into my home design as well: Can I even substantially change my home&#x27;s r-value the way it&#x27;s built?<p>I couldn&#x27;t afford a new home when I bought my house, so I live in older housing stock - 1949, made heavily of cinder blocks with plaster and stucco around them. It didn&#x27;t have ducting when built, and that was partially retrofitted in using a central furnace with limited air ducts to push heat clumsily from the center of the house into a few primary rooms using a California plenum to pull air from the foundation, connected to certain rooms through floor registers. There&#x27;s no good way to fix any of these compromises short of ripping half the home apart, or just building a new one, so the least bad compromise is usually an over-specced central forced air solution.<p>Do I get a central heat pump and air handler system with 100k peak BTUs? Do I get several mini-split units, each adding up to 100k BTUs? Do I overbuild on BTUs if I go mini-splits or multi-head? How will multiple smaller heat pumps work in winter as it freezes?<p>Will insulating change that? I can&#x27;t insulate my foundation more than the earth already does. I guess I could rip out all my plaster walls and put in drywall and high r-value insulation behind them, but at that point, maybe a new house would be more worth the effort.<p>I think these kind of problems are endemic to the older housing stock and they&#x27;re devilishly expensive to fix. Keep in mind - I have heat now. While my furnace will eventually depreciate to the point it needs replacement, to do all of this for no added functionality would be to take a new car&#x27;s worth of value and gamble I might save a little on energy costs over the next 15 years. It&#x27;s a dead-weight loss for me - I&#x27;m not going to recoup that on a house sale. It&#x27;s not my &#x27;forever&#x27; home, so I&#x27;m probably not going to stay more than 5 more years.

Here&#x27;s where a simple thought experiment might help understand the difference.<p>To clarify, we should note that I have never --ever-- in my many comments on this subject denied the genesis of the problem.  It is clear as day that we contributed a massive amount of CO2 and other gasses to the atmosphere.  Let&#x27;s get that out of the way.  This isn&#x27;t about denial of that fact.<p>Thought experiment:<p>Take an warehouse the size of a Home Depot (approximately 10K square meters or 100K square feet).<p>Seal it.  Nothing new comes in or goes out.  Air, water, nothing.<p>Make a 1 cubic meter pile of wood in the center of it and light it on fire.<p>Let it burn out.<p>Your job, now, is to clean it.<p>The energy content of 1 cubic meter of wood is in the order of 3 MWh.<p>How much energy will it take to clean 100% of the gasses and particulate matter generated by the burn and deposited on every square millimeter of this warehouse?<p>Of course, this question is impossible to answer, other than to suggest it will take a lot more than the energy expended to create the problem in the first place.  This is a basic principle in physics.  Right?  You cannot use less energy to reverse a process.<p>Another way to describe this principle is that it is far easier to cause destruction than it is to reverse it.  It is much easier to implode a building in Las Vegas than to clean it up and build a new one.  Etc.<p>Humanity burned fossil fuels with incredible energy content per cubic meter.  Massive, unthinkable amounts.<p>This is how we caused change.<p>And it will take massively more energy to reverse these changes.<p>And to do so quickly, it will take POWER.  Massive amounts of it.  Energy is power over time.  It is easy to talk about energy and lose sight of this.  Cleaning that warehouse to reverse the effects of the burn will take orders of magnitude more time than what it took to burn a cubic meter of wood.<p>And so, my argument is not at all misaligned with reality.  Yes, we did this in a very short period of time.  And yet, no, we cannot and will not fix it in anything even remotely resembling a human lifetime no matter what we do.  If humanity ceases to exist it will require 50K to 100K years per 100 ppm drop.  If we still exist, even if we implement the most draconian of changes, nothing will change.  Not one bit.  In fact, it is far more likely that atmospheric CO2 levels will continue to rise.<p>It would be far more intelligent to understand this and work on how to live in this reality.  The planet will take care of itself.  And no, humanity isn&#x27;t going to die off any time soon unless we start launching nukes across continents.</div><br/><div id="42420002" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42420002" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tzs</span><span>|</span><a href="#42417890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42419170">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42419603">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42420002">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42420002">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If humanity ceases to exist it will require 50K to 100K years per 100 ppm drop.<p>If we don&#x27;t cease to exist we could do that in a lot less time than 50k years.

I will call the amount of solar panels currently produced in one year an &quot;arseload&quot; of solar panels.<p>If we produced 1600 arseloads of solar panels (which would take 1600 years at the current rate of production) and used those to build solar farms in the 5 largest tropical deserts, and used the power from those to power direct air carbon capture operating at the efficiency of current direct air carbon capture (DAC) technology they would be removing enough carbon at a rate that would reduce the atmospheric CO2 levels from 450 ppm to 280 ppm (pre-industrial levels) in 6 years.<p>If the captured carbon was stored as graphite and spread out evenly under that 1600 arseloads of solar panels (which seems like a convenient place for it) it would be a layer roughly 1 cm deep.<p>Note that at around 180 arseloads of solar panels powering DAC we&#x27;d be removing CO2 fast enough to be removing about 10% more each year than we currently omit so even if we can&#x27;t manage to reduce fossil fuels if we can at least finally stop their growth we can start having CO2 reduction in a couple hundred years.<p>I&#x27;ve not done the math to figure out when a program of adding an arseload of solar panel powered DAC to tropical deserts every year would actually get us back to pre-industrial levels.

Please note the last paragraph of my much-maligned post:<p>&quot;There are legitimate and worthy reasons for which we should clean up our act. Climate change and saving the planet just happen not to be among them. Because it is impossible without violating the rules of physics.&quot;<p>As for reducing the magnitude of, as you put it, future damage, I very much doubt this is possible as well.<p>Loose quote from a research paper released by Google many years ago:  Even if we were to deploy the most optimal forms of renewable and clean energy sources at a global scale, not only will this not reverse the problem, atmospheric CO2 will continue to rise.<p>Part of our reality is inescapable.  For example, massive forest fires drive more CO2 into the atmosphere than lots of human activity.  Around the world, there are fires in mines that have been burning for centuries (google it, you&#x27;ll be surprised).  Etc.  We are kidding ourselves if we think that a bunch of measures that are but rounding errors at a planetary scale will have any impact at all in, as I like to put it, anything even remotely resembling a human time scale.<p>There are things we can do (and probably should do) that I think are likely to make for better and cleaner life all around without the fantasy of saving the planet or reversing climate.<p>One example of this is to seriously address the massive pollution created by container ships travelling our oceans every day.  These ships burn bunker fuel, perhaps the worst thing one could burn.  The stuff is horrible and the pollution it creates goes far beyond just CO2.  I also learned that they contribute to something called &quot;species pollution&quot;.  They ingest all sorts of marine life into the ballast tanks at port A and pump it out at port B, transporting species clear across the planet, where they can and have done serious damage.<p>How to address container ships is a subject that requires serious discussion.  It&#x27;s a complex multivariate problem.  Would all-electric ships be better?  Massive hydrofoils (for more efficient transport)?  Wind has been tried, it isn&#x27;t as much help as one might think.  Another optimization vector would be to eliminate them by distributing the production of material goods closer to their points of consumption.  In other words, eliminate container ships (unlikely) or reduce the fleet by only transporting materials that cannot be sourced at the point of manufacture.<p>Again, these are complex problems.  Their resolution, as a first step, requires leaving fantasy-land to then be able to discuss, evaluate and address reality.  Only then will we we able to improve life, clean-up our act and live better.  The value in these three desirable outcomes is self-evident to the point that they do not need to be justified by some fantastical imaginary doomsday scenario where all life on earth ceases to exist in, as some politicians have suggested, a dozen years.<p>I am all for being far better about how we behave on this planet.  My problem is with creating a religion out of fantasies.  Reality does not care about these things and keeps moving forward.

Still requires less energy than original used.<p>— Even if you insist on producing new molecules as energy-dense as the originals, there is vastly more energy available via non-CO2-outputting sources, such as solar, wind, etc. which often produce surpluses.  Again, the energy of the process has almost zero to do with promoting climate change.<p>So, <i>NO</i>, it neither a bad joke, a process that requires breaking laws of physics, at fantasy, or a scam.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42421893" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42421893" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pfdietz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42417890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42419195">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42419807">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42418769">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42421893">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42421893">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You do realize that removing CO2 will require massively more energy than what went into adding it to the atmosphere, right?<p>The reaction of CO2 with silicate rocks that pulls CO2 out of the atmosphere naturally (and is why the Earth is not like Venus with 90 bar of CO2 in the atmosphere) is exothermic.

Smart people are pretty good at figuring out the costs and benefits. What you need is to cultivate an environment where safety is a priority, but it’s recognized that it also has a cost and tradeoffs, and there’s a sweet spot that isn’t “maximum safety at all costs.”<p>The American FAA is a pretty good example. They’ve made air travel extremely safe while also allowing it to become very cheap. Their safety record has become essentially perfect but that doesn’t come from preferring safety at all costs. They put a dollar figure on each life to determine if a safety requirement is actually worth the cost. And they recognize when unintended consequences result in a worse overall outcome. For example, child safety seats are not required on airliners despite clear evidence that they would save lives in the event of a crash. Why? Because the expense and inconvenience would push some parents to drive to their destination instead of fly. Driving is much more dangerous. They ran the numbers and found that requiring child safety seats would cost lives on net.<p>The FAA is far from perfect and they seem to have been slipping in recent years. But they’re a good example of how this can be done. The hard part is getting people to allow it to be done. A lot of people will insist on spending a billion dollars to save one life. Or insist on focusing on one particular area and saving lives there, ignoring a loss of life caused elsewhere. This can be resisted but it takes a lot of work.</div><br/><div id="42418279" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42418279" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">naming_the_user</span><span>|</span><a href="#42417890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42418167">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42418048">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42418279">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42418279">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree with this but I think that the FAA comes with pretty heavy caveats which limit the wider applicability of the model.<p>An airliner is something that is essentially impossible for a garage crew to produce, even less so if they want to be FAA accredited, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter because, well, it&#x27;s basically impractical for someone to build a jet anyway.<p>Most industries aren&#x27;t like this and if you had an equivalent of the FAA for say, hand car washes, either they would basically do nothing at all, or it would be so onerous that suddenly the only people that can open car washes would be megacorps.

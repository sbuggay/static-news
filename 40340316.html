From a resting pulse of 70–72, he was able to increase it up to 100 by and decrease it to a steady 64–66.[5] When asked how he could do this, he replied that he would either &quot;see&quot; himself running after a train that has just begun to pull out or by &quot;seeing&quot; himself lying in bed perfectly still while trying to fall asleep. Shereshevsky was also able to simultaneously raise the temperature of his right hand by 2 degrees while lowering the temperature of his left hand by 1.5 degrees.[6] Once again, he stated that to do this, he simply &quot;saw&quot; a situation in which his right hand was touching a hot stove while his left hand was grasping a cube of ice. Shereshevsky also claimed to have been able to avoid pain by imagining that someone else was experiencing it and watching the other man experience it.[7] As he described, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t hurt me, you understand, but &#x27;him.&#x27; I just don&#x27;t feel any pain.&quot; This, however, was never tested by Luria. Additionally, Shereshevsky claimed to be able to cure himself and others of sickness by imagining that the problem went away. This was dismissed by Luria as &quot;naive magical thinking.&quot;[8]<p>&gt;  After he discovered his own abilities, he performed as a mnemonist; but this created confusion in his mind. He went as far as writing things down on paper and burning it, so that he could see the words in cinders, in a desperate attempt to forget them. … Reportedly, in his late years, he realized that he could forget facts with just a conscious desire to remove them from his memory, although Luria did not test this directly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

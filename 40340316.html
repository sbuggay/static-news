I can&#x27;t really explain it, but I was often accused of cheating in school because I could visualize a textbook page I had read and &quot;read&quot; it in my mind word for word and find the answers for tests. Because of this I never really felt the need to study. I was raised in a religious setting and they used this ability to have me memorize large chunks of text from the Bible - at one point I had about 50% of the new testament completely memorized.<p>Then one day it just suddenly left me. I&#x27;m kind of glad. My short term memory is still extremely good, and I can typically hold about 20-25 &quot;tokens&quot; in my head in order without issues, but converting that to a long term memory like I used to be able to do is just gone.

From a resting pulse of 70–72, he was able to increase it up to 100 by and decrease it to a steady 64–66.[5] When asked how he could do this, he replied that he would either &quot;see&quot; himself running after a train that has just begun to pull out or by &quot;seeing&quot; himself lying in bed perfectly still while trying to fall asleep. Shereshevsky was also able to simultaneously raise the temperature of his right hand by 2 degrees while lowering the temperature of his left hand by 1.5 degrees.[6] Once again, he stated that to do this, he simply &quot;saw&quot; a situation in which his right hand was touching a hot stove while his left hand was grasping a cube of ice. Shereshevsky also claimed to have been able to avoid pain by imagining that someone else was experiencing it and watching the other man experience it.[7] As he described, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t hurt me, you understand, but &#x27;him.&#x27; I just don&#x27;t feel any pain.&quot; This, however, was never tested by Luria. Additionally, Shereshevsky claimed to be able to cure himself and others of sickness by imagining that the problem went away. This was dismissed by Luria as &quot;naive magical thinking.&quot;[8]<p>&gt;  After he discovered his own abilities, he performed as a mnemonist; but this created confusion in his mind. He went as far as writing things down on paper and burning it, so that he could see the words in cinders, in a desperate attempt to forget them. … Reportedly, in his late years, he realized that he could forget facts with just a conscious desire to remove them from his memory, although Luria did not test this directly.</div><br/><div id="40341240" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40341240" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seletskiy</span><span>|</span><a href="#40341074">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40341209">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40341240">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40341240">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Interestingly, I have the ability to increase my resting pulse rate and then decrease it back to normal, without using any specific imagination techniques. I believe this is closely linked to the release of epinephrine into the bloodstream. To achieve this, I simply recall the sensation that arises when my body has the actual epinephrine response. This either tricks my body into responding as if there were an actual epinephrine response, or perhaps a small amount of epinephrine is actually released - I&#x27;m not entirely sure. Apart from increased pulse, my pupils also dilate significantly for a short time, which is also can be linked to adrenaline response.<p>I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to test this in a clinical setting under an ECG. Not only did it increase my pulse, but it also caused the QRS complex to invert. Upon seeing this, the doctors advised me not to continue with this practice. However, I didn&#x27;t experience any negative effects from this experiment. On the flip side, I haven&#x27;t found any practical use for this ability either.<p>I would be intrigued to connect with someone else who has a similar capability. It seems that those internal &quot;feelings&quot; is as close to direct control as we can get.<p>As of pain, I have similar experience as well, except instead of detaching myself from the pain, I &quot;look&quot; as closely as I can. At a certain point pain decomposes to what it really is — electrical impulses, and from this point it literally starting to feel as electricity going through your body, quite the same feeling as if you accidentally grab both pins of the electrical plug, albeit not as intense.</div><br/><div id="40341852" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40341852" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">istinetz</span><span>|</span><a href="#40341074">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40341240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40341336">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40341852">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40341852">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;On the flip side, I haven&#x27;t found any practical use for this ability either.<p>well, you can reliably trick a polygraph</div><br/></div></div><div id="40341336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40341336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vitalnodo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40341074">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40341240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40341852">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40341808">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40341336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40341336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If we&#x27;re discussing controlled changes in physical condition using various equipment that allows measurement, it&#x27;s called biofeedback.

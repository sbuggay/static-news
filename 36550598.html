And that was from 2015.<p>Google, Youtube, Facebook, TikTok are not going to tell content creators that.<p>They want everyone busy searching for an audience (to hand off to Advertisors). And everyone wants Attention. But there are not enough eyeballs. Yet the mindless marketing mega machine is still running and projecting consumption growth. Content creators are getting paid. How come? It all very similar to the subprime meltdown. There too everyone seemed to be having a good time.<p>The machine is so over optimized and efficient, it will get ppl to buy your book, and the majority will never have time to read it, or forget about anything in it a few days after consuming it.<p>Their entire shtick has been we will give you free tools, free distribution (ala free mortgages). You guys generate content. Your job is to find audience and get glory. So everyone is falling over each other producing content. But what they dont tell anyone is they cant generate new eyeballs to consume it all. So content has been exploding. How is consumption supposed to grow? The views come from getting ppl to be more and more scatter focused. Attention to anything is breaking down to the point where ppl are completely lost and overloaded by Info.<p>For what? To keeping selling Ads. People will keep going into debt and keep buying whatever shit the Ads tell them too.<p>Another promise they made was their search results and news feed will highlight the best quality content.<p>But anyone can see what kinds of total shit gets propped up everyday, because the platforms themselves are over run by content and spam. Cost to spam has dropped to 0 cause the tools are all free. Again all this is thanks to the need to show Ads everywhere. Every search query show an ad. Every inch of a stream show an Ad.<p>The majority doesn&#x27;t have the eyeballs or the disposable income to keep content factories running. Its Ads. Disney&#x27;s Bob Iger has said their pipelines can produce marvel level blockbusters everyday, but there are not enough ppl to pay the bill. So what to do? Look at Netflix - start showing ads.<p>Chat GPT et al might break the curse of ad infested news feeds and search results. And advertisers, marketers, govts and content creators are all equally effected by the breaking down of Attention. The big question is what does a new system look like where Attention isnt being exploited and Info overload is under control.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36569223" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36569223" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">js8</span><span>|</span><a href="#36568659">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36570181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36569223">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36569223">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Douglas Rushkoff was also recently interviewed by Sam Seder: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nS3-dQen-YM">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nS3-dQen-YM</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36570181" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36570181" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mif</span><span>|</span><a href="#36569223">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36568297">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36570181">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36570181">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My big takeaway is his analogy of “read&#x2F;write” and “read-only”.

Right?<p>It is similar to Ted K in that, yes, here is a whole lot of problems that the technological society have brought on. Cool, now what?

Trust me, alarm fatigue is a known phenomenon to these manufacturers, and theres been a recent trend (with, eg, the Dexcom G7) of giving <i>users</i> more control over delaying alarms, silencing them until you can respond etc etc, which has its benefits, especially as quality of life is concerned.<p>You&#x27;ll have a hard time convincing the FDA of this for critical devices like those found in hospitals though.</div><br/><div id="40615450" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40615450" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jimmySixDOF</span><span>|</span><a href="#40615024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40616229">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40615450">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40615450">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The airline industry went through this too and have moderated requirements to be more understanding of who it&#x27;s consumers are and when.

I doubt any one person would be in trouble as it was a collective&#x2F;systemic failure, but I don&#x27;t know exactly what would have come of it. Likely a policy change or daily reminders for the next few weeks about not ignoring the monitors even if it has been going off nonstop for hours. Maybe extra charting or peer audits. It&#x27;s a lot less expensive and effort to put pressure on staff than it is to change technology (even if it is as little as setting different, more sane, defaults). Depending on what was recorded from the monitor to the chart, if it looked like there wasn&#x27;t a delay in resuscitation&#x2F;cardioversion (like if the lethal rhythm wasn&#x27;t recorded initially), it may have been just put down as clinical course for the patient, like you suggested.

In an airplane, the environment is highly controlled, with a single set of systems specific to that aircraft. In contrast, hospitals often have multiple systems operating simultaneously in the same room or nearby. This can lead to cognitive overload when multiple systems issue verbal warnings simultaneously. In such scenarios, tone alarms might be easier to manage and differentiate than multiple overlapping verbal warnings.</div><br/><div id="40614250" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40614250" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akira2501</span><span>|</span><a href="#40612352">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40613551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40612464">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40614250">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40614250">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In an airplane, the environment is highly controlled<p>Aircraft systems are developed independently and added as options to planes.

The worst thing by far is the constant beeping and noises in the room, which totally disrupts rest and hurts recovery. It is SO obvious that this hurts patients (and visitors), that I cannot believe the entire medical industry (nurses, doctors, hospital administrators, equipment makers, insurance companies) have failed to do anything about it. It also makes it hard to know if some sound is expected or if it is a signal that something is wrong. In addition to this, I’ve seen nurses make mistakes several times because the equipment is too confusing. Once, I had to page the nurse myself because the IV they thought they set up was not functioning and I was able to discern that from the screen on the IV machine (which said one particular drug was not active) but they had not noticed, essentially administering an imbalanced cocktail of drugs for a period of time.<p>My take - the medical industry has too many barriers to competition, and it is too difficult for people who work with these things to do anything about it as well. It’s unclear who the buyers are at a hospital or how a startup could reach them. It’s also unclear what sort of interoperability (for example with Epic for charting) is needed. Regulations also make it difficult to get devices approved and investors are less likely to support a startup in this space.</div><br/><div id="40613361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40613361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmd</span><span>|</span><a href="#40612527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40612911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40613361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40613361">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">About 15 years ago I worked for a medical usability firm.

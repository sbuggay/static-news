BASH! SNARL! TEAR!<p>&gt; These are the sounds emanating from Intel&#x27;s council chambers these days. An explanation:<p>&gt; If you have just returned from a year&#x27;s stay on the planet Zorn, you will be surprised to learn that the iAPX 432, which had been intended to carry Intel&#x27;s high performance banner, is now seriously dead. With customers angrily demanding an upward migration path within the Intel family to compete with the forthcoming Motorola 32 bit machine (and even the forthcoming National 32 bit machine), Intel hurriedly announced THEIR 32 bit microprocessor. Several weeks AFTER that hurried announcement, they decided the part number would be the iAPX 386. So far, the part number is ALL that is definite about that device,<p>&gt; You see, there is one hellaceaus fight going on between the performance faction in Intel, who want to build a real computer (NOT an 8080 emulator) for a change and the compatibility faction, who have their gaze fixed on those warehouses (not one of which has burned down yet).<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easy68k.com&#x2F;paulrsm&#x2F;dg&#x2F;dg13.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easy68k.com&#x2F;paulrsm&#x2F;dg&#x2F;dg13.htm</a><p>They also anticipated in 1981 that Apple would be putting out 68k &quot;minicomputer&quot;:<p>&gt; ...there are a lot of companies who are planning to drive the PDP 11&#x2F;70 out of the marketplace with $10,000 (base price) 68000 systems.

DTACK grounded refers to the DaTa ACKnowledgment pin on a Motorola 68000. It&#x27;s the signal that (when grounded) lets the CPU know that data it has requested from memory is ready to be read off the data bus. Systems with slow memory need to be careful that they ground the pin only when the memory has responded.<p>However, if your memory system can outrun the CPU, it was possible to just ground the pin and assume that the memory always responded in time to satisfy the CPU&#x27;s read requests. The centerpiece of &quot;DTACK Grounded&quot; was a set of Motorola 68000 CPU boards that (initially) did just that. The memory parts they used were expensive for the time and small, but they were fast, allowed DTACK to be grounded, and allowed the overall design of these CPU boards to be very simplistic and inexpensive. For a while, these boards were most likely the most accessible path to a 16&#x2F;32-bit microprocessor like the 68000.<p>What was also interesting was the way that these boards were used.  They were sold as attached processors for Commodore PET&#x27;s and Apple ][ machines. The software would then patch the internal 8-bit BASIC implementation to delegate math operations to the attached processor. Believe it or not, the speed improvement offered by the 68000 was significant enough to offset all of the other complexity around this implementation choice. The net was an accelerated and mostly compatible BASIC.<p>Later in the newsletter, the author talks about pairing an Intel 8087 with a 68000 to get better floating point. (The 8087 was a remarkable chip for the time.) The 8086 that was needed to run the 8087 is referred to as a &#x27;clock generator&#x27;. I guess the net architecture here was to be a 6502 Host CPU, connected to a 68000 attached processor using an 8086 and attached 8087 to accelerate floating point.<p>Meanwhile, PC clones had sockets for 8087 chips, Apple was releasing relatively inexpensive 68000 hardware, and the 80386 was well on the way. The writing was on the wall for the DTACK grounded approach to accelerating 8-bit microcomputers, but it must have been interesting while it lasted.</div><br/><div id="42618514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42618514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cmrdporcupine</span><span>|</span><a href="#42618500">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42619550">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42618514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42618514">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah the era of &quot;memory can outrun the CPU&quot; was brief and glorious. The approach 80s microcomputers used for graphics required it -- multiplexing the video between the VDP (C64 VIC-II, Atari ST Shifter, etc.) and the CPU on odd bus cycles. Nice and fun.<p>By the end of the decade the CPU was running 2-3x the speed of the fastest RAM.<p>Now things are soooo complicated.<p>Not sure about this alternate reality where Apple&#x27;s 68000 machines were cheap :-) (I say this as an Atari ST owner).<p>68000 has kind of aged well despite not being made anymore -- is perhaps now the only &quot;retro&quot; architecture which can be targeted by a full modern compiler. You can compile Rust, C++20, whatever, and have it run on a machine from 1981.

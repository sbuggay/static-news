Take a DINK couple with high paying jobs, say an engineer and an attorney. Without kids they can have a nice house or condo, regularly take great vacations, and still be saving enough to have the option of retiring in their 40s or 50s. But with kids, that mostly goes out the window. The societal expectation is that you should spend basically all your disposable time and income on your children, which means expensive daycare, travel sports (gotta start working on the college applications in grade school), and private schools (or &quot;good&quot; &quot;public&quot; schools gated by living in a super-expensive area). And even if you can avoid all that, colleges are very good at figuring out how much money you have and declaring that to be the tuition.<p>As a high-earning childless person myself, I&#x27;ll freely acknowledge that I should have been paying significantly higher taxes in order to benefit my counterparts who did have kids.

When cost of living as one person increases somewhere between notably and substantially faster than wages, it’s hard to justify paying for another person while likely also taking an income cut. You end up with entire classes of people whose careers will struggle to pay for their own life, let alone that of a kid. This is playing out in real time - I personally know people who commute 30-45 minutes by car to make $23&#x2F;hour (in Canada, in a moderately high CoL city - that’s $16USD). When I was in university, some of my classmates who worked at the Starbucks near campus had coworkers (there were at least two instances of this that I know of) in their 40s with kids who commuted over an hour to make however much money Starbucks managers make, and one had a second job on weekends. It’s not hard to look at that and think, “how is that something you’d want to do to yourself?”
- The feeling (perceived or real) that the world is becoming a worse place. 24 hour news and social media don’t help, with either the perception or the actual situation. Why would I want to raise a kid who could be a victim of one of the weekly school shootings? Or who’s going to be left dealing with an even harder life financially&#x2F;etc? Or who’s going to resent older generations for selfishly wasting the earth’s resources?<p>It’s generally quite easy when you work in tech with a partner who works in tech to just assume that having kids is an easy choice (I work with people who are like that, who apparently only see the world through rose-tinted glasses, and are shocked someone could even possibly not want to pop out as many babies as possible). But when you look at the level of struggle a significant portion of the population endures, as they become generally more educated and more capable of critical thinking over time, it’s pretty clear why large swaths of people will start thinking “maybe we shouldn’t have kids just for the sake of having kids, especially if we don’t actually want to.”<p>That’s ignoring of course the general overpopulation and lack of sustainability of the western lifestyle (and the associated impact of having a kid on climate change - pretty much the single worst thing you could do, if you can about that at all). People who are tuned in to those sorts of issues are also more likely to not want kids, either because they don’t want to contribute to the problem, or raise kids who will have to deal with the fallout.<p>If you’re driven crazy by people having a different viewpoint from your own, you may want to consider reflecting on why you are so deeply entrenched in your beliefs. It is rarely productive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42347397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42347397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Spivak</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342626">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346130">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42348067">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42344124">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42347397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42347397">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well because to young people kids are a burden.

He angers me with the way he talks about stuff, but I consider it an exercise in mental fortitude. Allow me to share his absolutely crazy and unreasonable thoughts on this:<p>&quot;Nobody really wants more people except certain religious sects, and that is only because it allows them to use sexuality to control people. Most modern capitalists would favor automation precisely because it takes unreliable people out of the capitalistic equation and makes conversion of real property to wealth and power easier. The only reason why we&#x27;re hearing about fertility and birth rate in the last few years is because certain religious organizations are scared they&#x27;re going to end up losing their tax-free status and leveraging current social crises to make sure they stay relevant by any means necessary. I&#x27;m betting they have armies of incels ensnared in their fundamentalist ideologies getting tax-free money to shitpost on the various social networks.&quot;<p>I cut him off right there. I think he was drinking, and I haven&#x27;t talked to him since. I&#x27;m considering having him committed because he acts very strange. He may have a drug problem.<p>Anyway I disagree with his premise because COVID-19 did really expose weaknesses in the supply chain and global world order and showed that depending completely on foreign entities can make you non-resilient in the face of disaster. So we do need strong families and all that stuff that&#x27;s being talked about, it&#x27;s a real actual need.

If we reduce the free-time of people then they will have even less time to spend their money and consume goods. Arguably they would also have less incentive to care about free-time activities that they can only, at best, sample.<p>The basic question I am raising is why is 5 days of 8 hours magically the right number. I&#x27;d argue that the more free time people have the more chance to consume they have. We balance that with the need to produce though. So an optimum point is actually driven by efficiency. The more efficient we are the more we should be diverting to free-time in order to drive more demand for the the. efficient goods we are producing. In a world where we are infinitely efficient then 100% of time should be spent in free-time in order to consume the most goods produced by that infinite efficiency. We aren&#x27;t there yet so we still need to balance production against free-time but we are more efficient than we were 20 years ago so we should be finding ways to give back free-time to drive up demand.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42343700" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42343700" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eastbound</span><span>|</span><a href="#42343114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42343572">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342477">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42343700">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42343700">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Breaking windows also creates jobs.<p>(It’s a fallacy, but I’m too lazy to face the criticism if I explain it in full.

Also, Japan’s fertility rate isn’t that much lower than Canadas. They just got to the problem earlier than anyone else, so trying to resolve it with any possible means. The biggest problem still continues though — there’s no real reason or incentive to have more than 2 children, other than “for the good of the society”. And women are less likely to sacrifice bare minimum of 6 years of their lives to give birth to 3 children. Especially when they can do… literally anything else.<p>Every educated girl friend of mine thinks exactly the same way as well. Some had a child or two, but more than that it’s just a burden to the couple. I’m obviously simplifying things, and once the third child is born, they’re loved and etc. But it’s going to be a very hard sell for anyone.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42343794" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42343794" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Hilift</span><span>|</span><a href="#42342477">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42342717">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42346522">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42343794">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42343794">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Depopulation resulted in an oversupply of nine million housing vacancies outside the cities.

I&#x27;m not an &quot;infovore&quot; so I don&#x27;t care about the velocity of ideas entering my head. Otherwise why not just go on Blinkist and read (or better yet listen to) book summaries. I also get the sense that the 300-page book that takes a week to read probably sinks into my brain better than a 100-pager; perhaps for the simple fact that the 300-pager takes longer to finish so I wrestle with the ideas for longer.<p>That being said, I do appreciate concisely written books. I wonder if our preference for shorter, more succinct writings is an inevitable outcome of the information age. So much data enter our eyeballs every day. Maybe we just have less tolerance for &quot;fluff&quot; compared to our ancestors. Older writings tend to be much &quot;wordier&quot;. One example that comes to mind is the Einstein quote about simplicity from 1933: &quot;It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience&quot;. I prefer the condensed version: &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;.</div><br/><div id="42492443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42492443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Unearned5161</span><span>|</span><a href="#42491816">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42491870">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42492443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42492443">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes!

I haven&#x27;t tried Blinkist but I struggle to imagine how it&#x27;s any different.<p>A long books beauty is the path one takes to get to the conclusion the auther arrived at (over a much larger period of time themselves!), the debate, the details, the story, that&#x27;s where the real &quot;lessons&quot; are.

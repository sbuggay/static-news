But it’s almost <i>always</i> done as a stepping stone approach. You need to get the early adopters first or else none of the rest matters.<p>Doing this is <i>not easy</i> so any conceivable advantage is worth considering. Of course targeting build in public and indiehackers are not the only possible strategies for getting early users, but if it’s working for you, don’t underestimate how valuable that is.<p>Of course I do agree about going into it with both eyes open and knowing that if you’re successful enough, you will likely have to evolve somehow toward another customer segment.

Even for completely free games, sadly (you can thank mobile for that). the huge majority of nobody really cares about you until they do.<p>And tbf I get it: at least in a hacker scene you&#x27;re usually trying to perform something somewhat novel and that brings in curious hackers.

The unwillingness of their creators to scale the business by hiring more developers and shipping additional features—making the apps B2B-worthy, for example—means these apps often remain within that niche. However, when you&#x27;re already making millions per year, like Levels.io, you might decide that&#x27;s enough. This is especially true since indie hacking often embraces an ethos opposed to strategies like VC funding or building large teams, which typically drive scaling.<p>Some indie hacker projects do scale into successful bootstrapped businesses with teams of developers or receive VC funding, but that is the exception. Scaling requires the founder to have a larger vision beyond just making quick bucks and remaining independent—independence being a core motivation of indie hacking in the first place.

It’s a way to get people talking about what you’re building before it’s even done. The journey itself becomes the story, pulling in an audience that feels connected to your work.<p>For a lot of solo founders, though, it’s not just about visibility. It’s about support. Building something alone can be isolating, and sharing your progress becomes a way to stay connected, even when you’re grinding away in a room by yourself. The openness keeps you grounded and helps ward off the burnout that comes with long stretches of isolation.<p>It also puts you on the radar of other entrepreneurs and investors. They see what you’re up to and can offer feedback, partnerships, or even funding without you having to chase them down. You’re essentially creating a public portfolio of your work in real time.<p>Some people also use it as a humblebrag—a way to show off without being too obvious about it. That’s fine if that’s your thing, but for most, it’s a way to turn the lonely process of building into something more connected and human.<p>And I think that shouldn’t be discouraged.</div><br/><div id="41623307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41623307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">laike9m</span><span>|</span><a href="#41622044">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41622060">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41623307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41623307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Definitely agree.

You aren&#x27;t going to be a billionaire so power under capitalism isn&#x27;t available to you, so instead you&#x27;ll need to sell your labor until you have enough money to exploit and sell someone else&#x27;s labor at little cost to you. If the word &quot;exploit&quot; makes you feel icky, think of it more positively, like the way one might exploit a gold mine: by mining it.<p>At 4 million in the bank (and various assets) you should be good to &quot;escape,&quot; if by escape you mean &quot;not need to sell your labor to live&quot; anymore. 4 million gives you more than enough residuals to live off until death. Less if some of that is in property so you don&#x27;t have to pay rent. Less if you retire to southeast Asia and engage in geographic arbitrage. You spent years paying for carrier groups and precision missiles, why not reap the rewards?<p>So far as I can judge, this is the only way the system permits escape.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in permitless escape, one of my favorite introductions to the subject is &quot;Walkaway&quot; by Cory Doctorow, a wonderful amalgamation of hacker culture, anarchism, sustainability, anti capitalism, and communism.

If you don&#x27;t ship 90% of what you work on, but do ship the remaining 10%, then that may well not only be fine, but <i>optimal</i>.<p>My point is that saying to yourself &quot;Every time you don&#x27;t release a project, you&#x27;re telling yourself that you’re the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t ship.&quot; is a faulty belief. There&#x27;s a whole spectrum between releasing everything and releasing nothing. Some people like myself start a lot of things (big and small), and there is no practical way to finish all of them - life is simply not long enough. For such people, <i>not</i> finishing 80-90% of those projects and focusing on a few that seem to have higher value is the way to go. Such a person  should not (and hopefully does not) tell themselves that &quot;they&#x27;re the kind of person that doesn&#x27;t ship.&quot; If they do tell themselves that, the solution isn&#x27;t to start shipping everything they start, but to change their internal monologue.<p>I strongly recommend you get to know intricately the lives of successful creators.

A smoker that is looking to quit goes out with a colleague for a smoke break, and the colleague offers him one. If he refuses by saying “I don’t smoke now&#x2F;I’m trying to quit”, he will much more likely not be able to quit his addiction. But if he answers with “I’m not a smoker”, he  is on a good path.<p>It was a really eye opening part of that book for me - people’s view of themselves recursively depends on past experiences&#x2F;facts and inner motivations.

It helps me zone in. Why does this admittedly strange behavior help me? I&#x27;m not sure exactly, but I&#x27;ve known it to be helpful for more than half my life. I like to get up early before the family is awake, close Slack, put my phone in Do Not Disturb mode, and work. I even put a Post-it note on my monitor with the task I&#x27;m focusing on to help keep me on track. Sometimes I can accomplish more in that quiet hour and a half than I can in the rest of the day.<p>Except for the post-it note, I do those exact things. These seem to be the essential pre-requisites to being very productive (for me):<p>1. Set aside some time to work on something specific (with clear goals and intentions).<p>2. Block all interruptions (messages and calls of any kind and other distractions).<p>3. Focus and get in the zone. I find that music helps a lot here, and generally for me it&#x27;s electric music or songs with very subtle lyrics (almost dream-like). If the lyrics are too noticeable, they become a distraction.<p>The above works both for my personal projects and work. I work remotely and sometimes there are so many interruptions during the work day that I simply abandon everything and go do something else (a walk, groceries, work out, etc.). Then I catch up in the evening or during the weekend, when interruptions are at a minimum or completely absent for hours on end. Almost always I&#x27;m more productive in a couple hours like this than for entire days.<p>Finally, while I liked the article a lot, I disagree with the premise that projects _must_ be finished. It&#x27;s fine not to finish a project, it&#x27;s not failure at all.

Are you given prompts regarding the tone or content of your work?<p>Happy to share! The first piece I wrote for GitHub&#x27;s ReadME Project was called &quot;Publishing your work increases your luck&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;readme&#x2F;guides&#x2F;publishing-your-work">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;readme&#x2F;guides&#x2F;publishing-your-work</a>) and I was able to write it as a result of an interview I did with them previously.<p>Before I wrote that first piece, I reached out to the ReadME Project and told them that I had wanted to tell the story of my past year of overcoming fear and embracing putting myself out there. They agreed that that fit in their &quot;developer stories&quot; section and did an interview of me, which they published here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;readme&#x2F;stories&#x2F;aaron-francis">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;readme&#x2F;stories&#x2F;aaron-francis</a>.<p>After that they reached out and said &quot;sometimes we have our developer stories have a corresponding guide, do you want to write one&quot; and so that&#x27;s where the Publishing guide came from. I wrote it all for them and then they have a full on team of editors, proofreaders, illustrators, etc to help push it over the finish line. Before I wrote it I gave them an idea &#x2F; outline of what I was gonna say, to get the green light. Their editing has been very light, more flow than content. Like... move this sentence up; you repeated yourself there. That kinda thing.<p>The only time I had a piece really torn apart was this one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handsontable.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;modularizing-to-improve-the-developer-experience" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handsontable.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;modularizing-to-improve-the-de...</a> and it was because my voice just didn&#x27;t fit their blog at all. What you see on the site there is about 35% of what I originally wrote before it was completely toned down. It happens though! It&#x27;s their blog, so it&#x27;s gotta fit their voice.

I referenced that near the end:<p>&gt; Sometimes finishing is just the beginning: You release the library, the package, the SaaS product, and your work is really just beginning. Users have issues, customers have feedback, and dependencies need upgrading. In some sense, there is no finished software; there is only released software.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36317991" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36317991" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ilasky</span><span>|</span><a href="#36315898">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36313742">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36317991">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36317991">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really like the analogies of SLC (simple, lovable, and complete)[0] and “I’m the only user”[1] to motivate how I finish my projects.

Indeed, in grad school, there was very little graded homework and most was just assigned with solutions given for anyone who wanted to do it.<p>So, to bring the overly stretched analogy back to projects, I think you shouldn&#x27;t feel like you need to &quot;finish&quot; something if it meets enough of the goals you set for yourself.<p>Eg I spent months working on projects like custom OS&#x27;s and game engines. But as the nature of those kinds of projects is to have endless room for growth, I just drew the line at some point that I had learned and done enough and could just drop them in whatever potentially buggy state they were in.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36314836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36314836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hacknewslogin</span><span>|</span><a href="#36313742">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36316703">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36322924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36314836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36314836">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This reminds me of two quotes that really helped me with perfection anxiety:

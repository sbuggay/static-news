Will this fundamentally change how people find and access information? How do you create an experience so compelling that it replaces the current paradigm?<p>The future promised in Star Trek and even Apple&#x27;s Knowledge Navigator [2] from 1987 still feels distant. In those visions, users simply asked questions and received reliable answers - nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.<p>Combining two broken systems - compromised search engines and unreliable LLMs - seems unlikely to yield that vision. Legacy, ad-based search, has devolved into a wasteland of misaligned incentives, conflict of interest and prolifirated the web full of content farms optimized for ads and algos instead of humans.<p>Path forward requires solving the core challenge: actually surfacing the content people want to see, not what intermiediaries want them to see - which means a different business model in seach, where there are no intermediaries. I do not see a way around this. Advancing models without advancing search is like having a michelin star chef work with spoiled ingredients.<p>I am cautiously optimistic we will eventually get there, but boy, we will need a fundamentally different setup in terms of incentives involved in information consumption, both in tech and society.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kagi.com&#x2F;age-pagerank-over" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kagi.com&#x2F;age-pagerank-over</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=umJsITGzXd0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=umJsITGzXd0</a></div><br/><div id="42013875" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013875" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus_holmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42010013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42011621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013875">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013875">[29 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree that this is the core question, but I&#x27;d put it as: Who Gets To Decide What Is True?<p>With a search paradigm this wasn&#x27;t an issue as much, because the answers were presented as &quot;here&#x27;s a bunch of websites that appear to deal with the question you asked&quot;. It was then up to the reader to decide which of those sites they wanted to visit, and therefore which viewpoints they got to see.<p>With an LLM answering the question, this is critical.<p>To paraphrase a recent conversation I had with a friend: &quot;in the USA, can illegal immigrants vote?&quot; has a single truthful answer (&quot;no&quot; obviously). But there are many places around the web saying other things (which is why my friend was confused). An LLM trawling the web could very conceivably come up with a non-truthful answer.<p>This is possibly a bad example, because the truth is very clearly written down by the government, based on exact laws. It just happened to be a recent example that I encountered of how the internet leads people astray.<p>A better example might be &quot;is dietary saturated fat a major factor for heart disease in Western countries?&quot;. The current government publications (which answer &quot;yes&quot;) for this are probably wrong based on recent research. The government cannot be relied upon as a source of truth for this.<p>And, generally, allowing the government to decide what is true is probably a path we (as a civilisation) do not want to take.

Here is how ChatGPT explained it to me:<p>&gt; Recipes themselves, particularly the list of ingredients and steps, generally can&#x27;t be copyrighted because they&#x27;re considered functional instructions. However, the unique way a recipe is presented—such as personal stories, anecdotes, or detailed explanations—can be copyrighted. By adding this extra content, bloggers and recipe creators can make their work distinctive and protectable under copyright law, which also encourages people to stay on their page longer (a bonus for ad revenue).<p>&gt; In many cases, though, bloggers also do this to build a connection with readers, share cooking tips, or explain why a recipe is special to them.

Sergey Brin and Larry Page called this out in 1998 and it is just as true as ever: you need the economics to align. Kagi wins if people keep paying for it. Google wins if you click on Search ads or if you visit a page filled with their non-Search ads.<p>* Partially because of the economic alignment, Kagi has robust features for customizing your search results. The classic example is that you can block Pinterest, but it also allows gentler up- and down-weights. I have Wikipedia get a boost whenever its results are relevant, which is by itself a huge improvement over Google lately. Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t see Fandom wikis unless there&#x27;s <i>absolutely</i> nothing else.<p>I hope to see more innovation from Kagi in the customization side of things, because I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to make the biggest difference in preventing SEO gaming. If users can react instantly to block your site because it&#x27;s filled with garbage, then it won&#x27;t matter as much if you find a brief exploit that gets you into the first page of the natural search results. On Google Fandom is impossible to avoid. On Kagi it just takes one click.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42012251" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42012251" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gr__or</span><span>|</span><a href="#42010013">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42011621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013275">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42012192">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42012251">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42012251">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don’t understand how it’s different to Perplexity, looks pretty much the same.

I like to think that LLM-based search may be better for direct questions but traditional search is better for search queries, akin to a version of grep for the web.  If that is what you need, then traditional search is better.  But these are different use cases, in my view, and it is easy to confuse the two when the only interface is a single search box that accepts both kinds of queries.<p>One issue is that Google and other search engines do not really have much of a query language anymore and they have largely moved away from the idea that you are searching for strings in a page (like the mental model of using grep).  I kinda wish that modern search wasn&#x27;t so overloaded and just stuck to a clearer approach akin to grep.  Other specialty search engines have much more concrete query languages and it is much clearer what you are doing when you search a query.  Consider JSTOR [1] or ProQuest [2], for example.  Both have proximity operators, which are extremely useful when searching large numbers of documents for narrow concepts.  I wish Google or other search engines like Kagi would have proximity operators or just more operators in general.  That makes it much clearer what you are in fact doing when you submit a search query.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.jstor.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115012261448-Searching-Similar-Spellings-Wildcards-and-Proximity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.jstor.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115012261448-Sea...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proquest.libguides.com&#x2F;proquestplatform&#x2F;tips" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proquest.libguides.com&#x2F;proquestplatform&#x2F;tips</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42013465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42013465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MollyRealized</span><span>|</span><a href="#42010013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42010151">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42011735">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42013465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42013465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;The future promised in Star Trek [...] nobody had to fact-check the answers ever.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re actually a bit mistaken, there.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Court_Martial_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Court_Martial_(Star_Trek:_The_...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42011735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42011735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hadlock</span><span>|</span><a href="#42010013">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42013465">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42010163">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42011735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42011735">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been using ChatGPT for about 6 weeks as my go-to for small questions (when is sunset in sf today? list currencies that start with the letter P, convert this timestamp PDT to GMT, when is the end of Q1 2025?) and it&#x27;s been great&#x2F;99% accurate.

What we actually refer to via &quot;fact&quot; is &quot;consensus&quot;. Truth is an apriori concept whereas we&#x27;re discussing posteriori claims. Any &quot;reasonable&quot; ai would give an indication of degree of certainty, and there&#x27;s no reliable or consensus-driven methodology to produce this <i>manually</i>, let alone <i>automatically</i>. The closest we come is the institution of &quot;science&quot; which can&#x27;t even—as it stands—reliably address the vast majority of claims made about the world today.<p>And this is even before discussing the thorny topic of the ways in which language binds to reality, to which I refer you to Wittgenstein, a person likely far more intelligent and epistemologically honest than anyone influencing AI work today.<p>Yes, wikipedia does tend to cohere with reality, or at least it sometimes does in my experience. That observation is wildly different from an expectation that it does in the present or will in the future reflect reality. Futhermore it&#x27;s not terribly difficult to find instances where it&#x27;s blatantly not correct. For instance, I&#x27;ve been in a wikipedia war over whether or not the Soviet Union killed 20 million christians for being christians (spoiler: they did not, and this is in fact more people than died in camps or gulags over the entire history of the state). However, because there are theologists at accredited universities that have published this claim, presumably with a beef against the soviet union for whatever reason (presumably &quot;anticommunism&quot;), it&#x27;s considered within the bounds of accuracy by wikipedia.<p>EDIT0: I&#x27;m not trying to claim wikipedia isn&#x27;t useful; I read it every day and generally take what it says to be meaningful and vaguely accurate. but the idea that you <i>should</i> trust what you read on it seems ridiculous. As always, it&#x27;s only as reliable as the sources it cites, which are only as reliable as the people and institutions that produce that cited work.<p>EDIT1: nice to see someone else from western mass on here; cheers.

Ad revenue will get in the way as always and the LLM-based search will start injecting advertisements in its results. How other companies manage to advertise on this new platform will be figured out. What LLM-based search does is give Microsoft and others the opportunity to take down Google as the canonical search engine.

Sooner or later, they&#x27;re going to take your money <i>and</i> serve you ads, just like the others.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42008930" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42008930" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">littlestymaar</span><span>|</span><a href="#42008743">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42008835">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42008930">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42008930">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not long before it&#x27;s forbidden by law with rules like “if you say the name of one brand, you must name at least two competitors” I suspect.</div><br/><div id="42008960" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42008960" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KeplerBoy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42008743">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42008930">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42008960">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42008960">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;ll be the European version.</div><br/><div id="42008998" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42008998" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">littlestymaar</span><span>|</span><a href="#42008743">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42008960">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42008998">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42008998">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Don&#x27;t Americans also have rules about hidden advertising like that in regular media?</div><br/><div id="42009225" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42009225" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bandrami</span><span>|</span><a href="#42008743">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42008998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009106">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42009225">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42009225">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The American model prefers &quot;sponsored material should be identified as such&quot; though that&#x27;s only active for broadcasting currently</div><br/></div></div><div id="42009106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42009106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tiahura</span><span>|</span><a href="#42008743">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42008998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009225">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42009106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42009106">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">American law generally favors freedom of expression.</div><br/><div id="42009259" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42009259" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arcticbull</span><span>|</span><a href="#42008743">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42009106">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42014886">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42009259">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42009259">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are several classes of restrictions on free speech in the US.

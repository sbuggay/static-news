I own Max and have loved to use it but dealing with the fact that it&#x27;s a visual language can be very painful. I know a lot of people who just moved away from Max to JUCE, which is a C++ framework for writing VSTs, AUs, etc. The problem is that in that case you lose a lot of the power of Max for Live, since Ableton Live only exposes its deep internal API through Max for Live. It&#x27;s a huge shame there isn&#x27;t a C or C++ API for Ableton Live.<p>I don&#x27;t really use Max that much anymore, since ultimately the benefit is that it&#x27;s supposed to be easier to use than C++, but I find that really hard to believe in my experience. Another supposed benefit was supposed to be that Max came with a bunch of UI and DSP stuff built in, but they seem to have now neglected that aspect of the software and instead creating new projects like gen~ and RNBO (I&#x27;m not sure what the point of RNBO is). The thing is, JUCE gives us all the stuff that it was cool that Max came with 2 decades ago, plus more, while being less buggy and able to create production quality plugins.<p>I think the ultimate staying power of Max is simply due to it having aesthetic weight in the artistic community. It&#x27;s still the &quot;cool option&quot; for the interactive art exhibition crowd. Other than that, the only thing really keeping it alive is Ableton...<p>Max is still a great piece of software, but these days, just learn to code.</div><br/><div id="39115074" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39115074" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tumult</span><span>|</span><a href="#39114827">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39115074">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39115074">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is it great? I&#x27;ve never liked it. It has downsides of assembly programming, like unnamed (but persistent) values stored in temporary &quot;register&quot; slot output pins, some additional own-goal downsides like &quot;significant whitespace&quot; of the positioning of wires and port output ordering, and all of the downsides of an oldschool scripting language like TCL, with terrible performance characteristics, buggy implementation, an editor that crashes pretty regularly in normal use, and incomplete documentation.<p>In the long history of Max, I can only think of a couple of things I&#x27;ve liked that were made with it, and they were both for Max for Live. I think the fact that they were made with Max was just incidental — it&#x27;s the easiest way to add MIDI effects to Live.<p>(For anyone who answers with &quot;but you can just write JavaScript now to do everything in it&quot; — running MIDI events through its JS nodes defers the events to the non-timing-critical thread, ruining the timing of the MIDI events.)</div><br/><div id="39115095" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39115095" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bowsamic</span><span>|</span><a href="#39114827">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39115074">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39115095">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39115095">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I addressed all those points in my post, some implicitly and some explicitly, did you read the whole thing?

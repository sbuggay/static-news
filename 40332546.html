Maybe it&#x27;s my many years of GTD speaking, but Calendar is a sacred space for me. Nothing goes to my calendar unless it&#x27;s something that <i>has</i> to be done at that specific date or date-time. 
I want to see the real hard boundaries of my schedule, understand where the flexible space is, and juggle with that according to what life is throwing at me today.
Filling your calendar with all your todos will completely mess this up. You don&#x27;t have a quick bird-eye view of what is <i>really</i> important to be done, and what is wishful thinking.
Not to speak of the time you will be wasting &quot;managing&quot; your calendar entries now.<p>Side-note: I don&#x27;t know if anyone else feels the same, but I&#x27;ve grown a kind of jerk reaction every time I read or listen(YT videos mostly) someone sayying &quot;many people have asked me about X&quot;. It&#x27;s more often than not, bullshit. Nobody asked you anything, you just want a reason to speak your opinion, that&#x27;s fine.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

What I meant is that this section is explaining HOOO EP and my interest is in communicating what it is on its own sake, without needing to compare it to Provability Logic all the time. However, since HOOO EP is so similar to Provability Logic, it requires some clarification. I hope you found the section useful even though you were not able to see how it is an alternative notion of provability from its definition.<p>&gt; Why do you expect to be able to prove `□false =&gt; false` ? I.e. why do you expect to be able to prove `not □false`, i.e. prove the consistency of the system you are working in.<p>I think this is trying to think about logic as a peculiar way. HOOO EP was not developed to reason about consistency. It has its own motivation that makes sense. However, once you have HOOO EP, you can start discussing how it relates to consistency of theories.<p>It makes sense, in a sense of consistency, from the perspective where an inconsistent theory is absurd. Absurd theories can prove anything, so there is no distinction between true and false statements. Now, if you interpret `□false` as an assumption that one can prove false, then of course, one can prove false. `□false =&gt; false` is the same as `!□false`. Does this mean that it proves its own consistency? No, because you made the assumption `□false`. You have only talked about what you can prove in the context of `□false`. From this perspective, `□false =&gt; false` is trivially true.<p>Provability Logic does not allow you to think of `□false` as meaning &quot;I can prove `false`&quot;. Instead, it is interpreted as &quot;this theory is inconsistent&quot; but without assigning this statement a particular meaning. This means, there is a gap between &quot;I can prove `false`&quot; and &quot;this theory is inconsistent&quot;. Now, if you ignore the gap, then you are just making an error of interpretation. You have to respect the formal sense, where Provability Logic can have two different notions of absurdity while naturally you would think of them as one. However, if you want to have one instead of two, then you need HOOO EP.<p>&gt; Also, if you want to do reasoning from within an inconsistent theory, then I’d hope it is at least paraconsistent, as otherwise you aren’t going to get much of value?<p>It sounds like you are assuming HOOO EP is inconsistent?

One way to put it: Provability Logic is balancing on a knife-edge. It works, but just barely. However, you can turn it around and say the new notion is balancing on a knife-edge by requiring DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) at meta-level. They way I see it, is that both approaches have implicit assumptions and you have to trade one with another.<p>I am working on an implementation of the new notion of provability (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;hooo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;hooo</a>), after finding the axioms last year (it took several months):<p><pre><code>    pow_lift : a^b -&gt; (a^b)^c

    tauto_hooo_imply : (a =&gt; b)^c -&gt; (a^c =&gt; b^c)^true

    tauto_hooo_or : (a | b)^c -&gt; (a^c | b^c)^true
</code></pre>
As a modal logic the difference is surprisingly small, by swapping Löb&#x27;s axiom with T. `tauto_hooo_imply` is slightly stronger than K.<p>The major difference is that `|- p` equals `p^true` instead of implying, if you treat `|-` as internal. If you treat it as external, then you can think of it as N + T.<p>I needed this theory to handle reasoning about tautological congruent operators.<p>However, once you have this, you can perfectly reason about various modal logical theories by keeping separate modality operators, including Provability Logic, e.g. `modal_n_to : N&#x27;  -&gt;  all(a^true =&gt; □a)`.<p>So, it is not a tradeoff that loses Provability Logic. Instead, you get a &quot;finalized&quot; IPL for exponential propositions. This is why I think of as a natural way of extending IPL with some notion of provability.</div><br/><div id="38107822" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38107822" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deltasepsilon</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104412">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38106932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38105107">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38107822">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38107822">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for your response.

The difference is that a lambda can capture variables from the environment, such that `b =&gt; a` is possible &quot;at run-time&quot; in a way that does not hold for every possible world.

Could the difficulty in giving a good direct definition of mathematics be an essential one, indicating that mathematics has an essential recursive quality? Along these lines we might say that mathematics is the smallest subject satisfying the following:<p>- Mathematics includes the natural numbers and plane and solid geometry.<p>- Mathematics is that which mathematicians study.<p>- Mathematicians are those humans who advance human understanding of mathematics.<p>In other words, as mathematics advances, we incorporate it into our thinking. As our thinking becomes more sophisticated, we generate new mathematical concepts and new mathematical structures: the subject matter of mathematics changes to reflect how we think.<p>The foundations of mathematics then refers to the essential core that we have based our mathematical thinking on. Which is something that most of us only wish to think about when our thinking has run into problems and we need a better foundation.</div><br/><div id="38110190" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38110190" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yMEyUyNE1</span><span>|</span><a href="#38103423">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38109162">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38110190">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38110190">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.

Doesn’t a foundation have to change and adapt in relation to what is grounded in it? If the foundation is to be all encompassing, to abstract enough to allow and absolutely account for every possible superstructure that it may ever ground, would not the foundation itself be contentless, inexpressive? “Silence contains all sound”, and “Every moment has an infinite amount of time” are constructs that came to my mind as isomorphic to the questioning. As mathematical structures gets finer and more intricate, purely on the basis of necessity (survival of the mathematician, mankind and mathematics itself) and experimentation, so their foundations must undergo at least some change? Even though such changes are purely virtual, and of interpretative nature? The same ideology, but “taken as” something else, thus, ultimately, subjective? There also seems to emerge an issue of ordering, of a demand for primality and derivation, which screams paradox. Could all of mathematics fit within itself, being itself employed  to bootstrap its own, with no second system? A sort of ontological auto-genesis? Could our conception of paradox be itself primal, and perhaps, in some plane, could it be something ranking higher, of first-class? Also, I’ve been thinking, recently, on the role of time in structures. There can’t possibly be any structure whatsoever without time, or, more concretely, at least the memory of events, recollecting distinctive and contrasting entropic signatures. So, mathematics manifesting as, of, and for structure, wouldn’t it require, first and foremost, a treatment from physics?

A kind of turing tar pit but for proofs instead of programs. Some early attempts did not quite work out. I try to get it off the ground using the calculus of constructions (not the calculus of inductive constructions) together with a small set of axioms. As axioms I aim, at the moment, to use a hilbert epsilon operator to contstruct objects from theorems that state their existence, proof irrelevance and an infinity axiom that states that an infinite set exists. Also I do use an infinite hierarchy of Types a bit like the universes of coq. I am still debating with myself whether I also should provide the luxury of not having to specify universe levels and just keep constraints between them like in coq.<p>The article proposes the calculus of inductive constructions but I think that is just too big and complicated to be a good candidate for a foundation of mathematics. I think it makes more sense to use a more concise foundation and maybe attempt to prove that the calculus of inductive constructions is a conservative extension of that.</div><br/><div id="38107862" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38107862" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">c-cube</span><span>|</span><a href="#38103942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38105170">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38107862">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38107862">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you want something as simple as possible, look at HOL and similar simple logics!

In fact, in that kind of simple setup Prop and Set are just the same thing and one can just use two words as a syntactic sugar but not as anything meaningful. However, proof irrelevance then implies that every set only has one element, which is no good. So, then we we have at least two universe levels.

It just lets you state axioms, then prove theorems from axioms and other proven theorems (letting you stack them up). So you can choose your axioms. Set theory with classical logic? Or with intuitionistic logic? Maybe you&#x27;d prefer simple type theory? Carry on!<p>That said, the largest Metamath database (set of axioms and proven theorems) is the &quot;Metamath Proof Explorer&quot;. It&#x27;s based on ZFC set theory with classical logic. It turns out that ZFC set theory is quite enough to model structures. This database does add the Tarski–Grothendieck Axiom for certain uses of category theory (the same axiom added by Mizar), but it&#x27;s only used when it&#x27;s <i>needed</i> and that is quite rare. Heck, even the axiom of choice turns out to be unneeded in many cases. You certainly don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use ZFC with classical logic as your fundamental starting point (indeed, someone who rejected classical logic would not accept it).

For example, Set Theory is formalized in First Order Logic. However, First Order Logic uses Propositional Logic, so to build an alternative foundation to Set Theory, you might consider starting with Propositional Logic and extending it another way.<p>First Order Logic extends Propositional Logic with predicates. This might seem like a good design at first, until you try to reason about uniqueness. In Set Theory, one requires an equality operator in addition to set membership, in order to be able to reason about uniqueness, at all. This equality operator is ugly, because you have to rebuild objects that are isomorphic but using different encodings.<p>Predicates causes problems because they are unconstrained. For easier formalizing of advanced theories, I suggested Avatar Logic, which replaces predicates with binary relations, avatars and roles. You can try it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;avalog" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;avalog</a><p>Also, most theories assume congruence for all predicates, which is bad for e.g. foundations of randomness.<p>The next crisis in &quot;the foundations of mathematics&quot; will be &quot;tautological congruence&quot;.

It was a miracle.<p>If you are a Platonist (I am), then it is not really a miracle. Mathematical objects are real, and logic is a tool to study them. The paradoxes can only exist, because math is real: a paradox shows that something is not real, and if there were no real mathematical objects to begin with, paradoxes would be meaningless. As it stands, a paradox is a tool to distinguish reality from that which is not real.<p>Have fun making any kind of sense if you are a formalist or intuitionist (hint: you can&#x27;t).<p>It is indeed cool that something as simple as set theory covers so much. But it doesn&#x27;t cover everything. The Banach-Tarski Paradox shows that sets are not what we imagine them to be (but they are still real): we need to add the property of measurability, which acts then as an additional axiom, to get closer to that. And in order to solve BB(748), ZFC is not enough [0, theorem 7]. So, one set theory is not enough. Depending on which properties we ascribe to sets, or in other words, which axioms we add to set theory, we also get different set theories.<p>&gt; I give up.<p>Set theory is cool, but it is not special. In the end it describes a fragment of the (real) mathematical universe, but there is more to this universe than just set theory. And depending on which properties you pick for your sets, you get different fragments.<p>It is interesting that Larry says that Automath is not a Foundation, and that neither is Isabelle, which he created. Maybe I am putting words in his mouth here, but that is how I interpret his &quot;Isabelle&#x2F;Pure is in the same spirit&quot;. I think he is right. BUT, Isabelle is SO close to a foundation. All you have to do is to drop the types :-D. All of them. That&#x27;s what I did, and you then basically get Abstraction Logic [1]. Abstraction Logic makes no assumptions whatsoever about your mathematical universe, except that it is non-empty, and it better have more than 1 object in it. It doesn&#x27;t assume that sets exist, or types, or anything else. It doesn&#x27;t force you to define natural numbers or other mathematical objects as sets. You can define any operator you want, and with each choice of axioms you are exposed to the risk of doing nonsense and creating paradoxes. And therefore I believe it is the right foundation for mathematics, and I think it is the only right one. Yes, there is a single logical foundation. Sounds too simple? So did set theory. Yes, I think Abstraction Logic is a miracle, but on the other hand, it simply manifests logic as it is.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;bb.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;papers&#x2F;bb.pdf</a>, page 12, theorem 7<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abstractionlogic.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;abstractionlogic.com</a></div><br/><div id="38105945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38105945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drdeca</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104381">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38108990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38105945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38105945">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Abstraction Logic makes no assumptions whatsoever about your mathematical universe, except that it is non-empty, and it better have more than 1 object in it.

then, in the meta theory, you can prove a fair number of nice things about &quot;for all natural numbers n, it is provable in the object theory that [some statement which uses relations \in_n and&#x2F;or =_n]&quot;.<p>For example, you can show that, for all n, you can show in the object-theory that =_n is transitive and reflexive, and that if x =_n y, then x =_{n+1} y as well,  
and that for all A, B, if A \subseteq_n B , then A \subseteq_{n+1} B,  
and you can define notions of one object being a power set of another object at level n (and any two power sets of an object at level n, will be equal at level n), and can show that, for all n, it is provable in the object theory that if A \subseteq_n B , and if PA is a powerset of A at level n, and PB is a powerset of B at level n, then PA \subseteq_n PB , and all sorts of similar things.<p>I&#x27;m a little skeptical of the &quot;something between 1st order logic and 2nd order logic&quot; claim, but I haven&#x27;t looked closely.<p>Are you familiar with the metamath project? aiui, metamath is based in string rewrite rules, and is therefore fully general in the way it sounds like you are going for?</div><br/><div id="38107384" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38107384" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">practal</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104381">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38105945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38108990">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38107384">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38107384">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;m a little skeptical of the &quot;something between 1st order logic and 2nd order logic&quot; claim<p>And rightfully so. I&#x27;ve discovered Abstraction Logic (AL) over the course of the last two years, and in the beginning I didn&#x27;t know exactly what I had there. In later papers on abstractionlogic.com I understand AL better, the latest being &quot;Logic is Algebra&quot;. I would not say anymore that AL is in between first-order and second-order logic. Instead I would say that AL combines the benefits of first-order logic (one undivided mathematical universe U) with the benefits of higher-order logic (general binders). And there certainly is a second-order aspect to it, because an operator is a function that takes operations as arguments, and returns a value in the mathematical universe U; here an operation is a function that takes values in U as arguments, and also returns a value in U.<p>&gt; Are you familiar with the metamath project<p>Yes, I know it. I would say the main difference is that metamath doesn&#x27;t really have a proper semantics. It has some rules to manipulate syntax, but they don&#x27;t mean anything on their own. Only by making the rules of metamath simulate the deduction rules of logics like first-order logic, meaning enters the picture, by inheriting meaning from the simulated logic. On the other hand, Abstraction Logic has a proper and simple semantics of its own.<p>&gt; unless you count the laws of inference of FOL, which you shouldn&#x27;t<p>So the laws for your quantifiers are not counted, I guess, but given as a built-in feature of FOL?

It is removing mysticism (which I hate) and adds clarity. There are real things out there, and we can go and use them for our purposes. These things are so flexible that we can shape them into pretty much anything we want, bar inconsistency.<p>But yes, you need to state clearly the properties you are talking about. These can be axioms (and must be to a certain extent), but most of your math will consist of definitions (and theorems about them). And by doing all of this in a logic, on a computer, there is really no way to be much clearer and less mystic.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38103520" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38103520" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">westurner</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104381">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38103571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38103520">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38103520">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_t...</a> :<p>&gt; <i>Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory [ZFC], with the historically controversial axiom of choice (AC) included, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common</i> foundation of mathematics.<p>Foundation of mathematics: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Foundations_of_mathematics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Foundations_of_mathematics</a><p>Implementation of mathematics in set theory: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Implementation_of_mathematics_in_set_theory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Implementation_of_mathematics_...</a> :<p>&gt; <i>The implementation of a number of basic mathematical concepts is carried out in parallel in ZFC (the dominant set theory) and in NFU, the version of Quine&#x27;s New Foundations shown to be consistent by R.

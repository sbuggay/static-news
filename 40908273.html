Their CompArch class has taught them the basics of branch prediction, cache coherence, and instruction caches; the trivial elements of performance.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat surprised the piece doesn&#x27;t deal at all with a classic performance killer, false sharing, although it seems mostly concerned with single-threaded latency. The total lack of &quot;free&quot; optimization tricks like fat LTO, PGO, or even the standardized hinting attributes ([[likely]], [[unlikely]]) for optimizing icache layout was also surprising.<p>Neither this piece, nor my undergraduates, deal with the more nitty-gritty elements of performance. These mostly get into the usage specifics of particular IO APIs, synchronization primitives, IPC mechanisms, and some of the more esoteric compiler builtins.<p>Besides all that, what the nascent low-latency programmer almost always lacks, and the hardest thing to instill in them, is a certain paranoia. A genuine fear, hate, and anger, towards unnecessary allocations, copies, and other performance killers. A creeping feeling that causes them to compulsively run the benchmarks through callgrind looking for calls into the object cache that miss and go to an allocator in the middle of the hot loop.<p>I think a formative moment for me was when I was writing a low-latency server and I realized that constructing a vector I&#x2F;O operation ended up being overall slower than just copying the small objects I was dealing with into a contiguous buffer and performing a single write. There&#x27;s no such thing as a free copy, and that includes fat pointers.</div><br/><div id="40911758" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40911758" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mbo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911715">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912535">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40911758">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40911758">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Out of interest, do you have any literature that you&#x27;d recommend instead?</div><br/><div id="40911822" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40911822" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nickelpro</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911715">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40911758">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40911822">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40911822">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the software side I don&#x27;t think HFT is as special a space as this paper makes it out to be.[1] Each year at cppcon there&#x27;s another half-dozen talks going in depth on different elements of performance that cover more ground collectively than any single paper will.<p>Similarly, there&#x27;s an immense amount of formal literature and textbooks out of the game development space that can be very useful to newcomers looking for structural approaches to high performance compute and IO loops.

I worked in HFT for half a decade.<p>Back in the late 2000s you were on the cutting edge if you were writing really good C++ and had overclocked some CPUs to hell and back and then shoved them in a rack in a datacenter in new jersey. &quot;To hell and back&quot; means &quot;they only crash every hour or two&quot; (because while they&#x27;re up, they&#x27;re faster than your competition).<p>Around the mid 2010&#x27;s it had moved entirely to FPGAs. Do something smart in software, then give the FPGA something dumb to wait for (e.g. use software to produce a model and wait for some kind of alpha to develop, then tell the FPGA &quot;ok wait for X &gt; Y and fire the order&quot; was basically the name of the game. And it was often better to be faster than it was to be smarter, so really you just kept the FPGA as simple and fast as possible.<p>At that point, your hard realtime constraints for the language doing the smart stuff really dissolve. Compared to an FPGA getting an order out the door in some fraction of a mic, a CPU doing anything is slow. So you might as well use python, yknow?<p>People also play all kinds of different speed games. There&#x27;s latency races around NJ and chicago where microseconds matter around price movements and C++ isn&#x27;t really part of the picture in a competitive way anymore, but that&#x27;s not to say someone isn&#x27;t ekeing out a niche where they&#x27;re doing something vaguely smarter faster than opponents. But these things, at scale, tend to be questions of - either your alpha is very short-lived (microseconds, and if it isn&#x27;t organically microseconds, it will be competed until it is), or it is fundamentally longer-lived (seconds to minutes?) and you might as well use python and develop 100x faster.<p>The silly thing is, the really good trades that focus on short-term alphas (ms&#x27;s and less) are generally obviously good trades and so you don&#x27;t have to be super smart to realize it&#x27;s a really fucking good trade, you had better be fast and go get it. So there&#x27;s also this kind of built-in bias for being fast because if a trade is so marginally good that you needed a crazy smart and slow model to tell it apart from a bad trade, it&#x27;s probably still a relatively crummy trade and all your smarts let you do is pick up a few extra pennies for your trouble.<p>I&#x27;ll close by saying don&#x27;t take my words as representative of the industry - the trades my firm specialized in was literally a dying breed and my understanding is that most of the big crazy-crazy-fast-microwave-network people have moved to doing order execution anyway, because most of the money in the crazy-crazy-fast game dried up as more firms switched to either DIYing the order execution or paying a former-HFT to do it for them.</div><br/><div id="40913735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mgaunard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911715">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912961">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913366">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913735">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even if the low-latency logic moves to the FPGA, you still need your slow path to be reasonably fast, say about 100us, and absolutely never more than 1ms.<p>To my knowledge Python is not suitable, though I know some players embed scripting languages that are.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40913366" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913366" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doovd</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911715">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912961">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913735">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913628">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913366">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913366">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; obviously good trades<p>Are you able to expand with any examples of this?</div><br/><div id="40913819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40913819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mgaunard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40911715">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913737">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40913819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40913819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The idea for aggressive orders in HFT is to buy before the market goes up, and sell before the market goes down.<p>HFT signals are about detecting those patterns right before they occur, but as early as the information is available globally.

Interested in feedback from people closer to the space.<p>First, split the load in to simple asset-specific data streams with a front-end FPGA for raw speed. Resist the temptation to actually execute here as the friction is too high for iteration, people, supply chain, etc. Input may be a FIX stream or similar, output is a series of asset-specific binary event streams along low-latency buses, split in to asset-specific segments of a scalable cluster of low-end MCUs. Second, get rid of the general purpose operating system assumption on your asset-specific MCU-based execution platform to enable faster turnaround using low-level code you can actually find people to write on hardware you can actually purchase. Third, profit? In such a setup you&#x27;d need to monitor the overall state with a general purpose OS based governor which could pause or change strategies by reprogramming the individual elements as required.<p>Just how low are the latencies involved? At a certain point you&#x27;re better off paying to get the hardware closer to the core than bothering with engineering, right? I guess that heavily depends on the rules and available DCs &#x2F; link infrastructure offered by the exchanges or pools in question. I would guess a number of profitable operations probably don&#x27;t disclose which pools they connect to and make a business of front-running, regulations or terms of service be damned.

The stacks I&#x27;ve seen with my own two eyeballs talked to supervision algorithms over PCIe (which themselves must be not-slow, but not in the same realm as &lt;10us work), but otherwise nothing crazy fancy.

In the get method, you&#x27;re returning a pointer to the element within the queue after bumping the consumer position (which frees the slot for the producer), so it can get overwritten while the user is accessing it.

Why do we pass by value when sharing ownership? Because it allows for move semantics, so that you give the caller to option to make a copy, which bumps up the reference count, or to entirely avoid any copy whatsoever, which allows transfering ownership without bumping the reference count.<p>Having said that, shared_ptrs do have their uses but they are very very rare and almost all of our use cases do not expose shared_ptr&#x27;s in the public API but rather use them as an implementation detail.

I&#x27;m pretty sure there is a large body of (computer science) research work around the topic of deterministic (reference-counted) vs non-deterministic (non-reference counted) garbage collection.  There are lots of pros and cons for both sides.  Also, I find it interesting that Java, C#, and GoLang all chose non-deterministic GC, but Perl and Python use deterministic GC.  (I&#x27;m not sure what Ruby does.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40912793" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40912793" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">josefx</span><span>|</span><a href="#40909602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40912012">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913686">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910520">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40912793">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40912793">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think CPython does reference counting for its memory management, it still has to run a GC since reference counting does not handle reference cycles.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40910520" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40910520" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fooker</span><span>|</span><a href="#40909602">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910572">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40913454">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40910520">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40910520">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You say it&#x27;s easier in Rust, but you still have a complete C++ implementation and not a Rust one. :)</div><br/><div id="40910577" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40910577" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sneilan1</span><span>|</span><a href="#40909602">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910520">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910556">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40910577">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40910577">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It took me about a year to build all of this stuff in C++.

But it&#x27;s not always the case that there&#x27;s a buyer there right at the time who actually wants the item for their own use. The inverse is also true for a prospective buyer. Enter middle-men or market makers who just hang around the marketplace, learning roughly how much people will buy or sell a given good for, and buy it for slightly less than they can sell it later for. This is actually generally useful if you just want to buy or sell something.<p>Now, does this need to get towards milli-seconds or nano-seconds? No, this is just the equivalent of many of these middle-men racing to give you an offer. But it&#x27;s (part of) how they compete with each other, and as they do so they squeeze the margins of the industry as a whole: In fact the profits of HFT firms have decreased as a percentage of the overall market and in absolute terms after the initial peak as they displaced the day traders doing the same thing.</div><br/><div id="40912944" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40912944" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bostik</span><span>|</span><a href="#40909944">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40912944">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40912944">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>it&#x27;s not always the case that there&#x27;s a buyer there right at the time</i><p>This hits the nail on the head. For a trade to happen, counterparties need to meet in price <i>and</i> in time. A market place is useless if there is nobody around to buy or sell at the same time you do.<p>The core service market makers provide is not liquidity. It&#x27;s immediacy: they offer (put up) liquidity in order to capture trades, but the value proposition for other traders - and the exchanges! - is that there is someone to take the other side of a trade when a non-MM entity wants to buy or sell instruments.<p>It took me a long time to understand what the difference is. And in order to make sure that there is sufficient liquidity in place, exchanges set up both contractual requirements and incentive structures for their market makers.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40910373" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40910373" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pi-rat</span><span>|</span><a href="#40909944">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910764">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40910026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40910373">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40910373">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Generally gets attributed with:<p>- Increased liquidity.

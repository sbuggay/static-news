After a particularly disappointing experience that knocked me off my horse for a while, I concluded that putting some distance between my career and the subjective experience of my place in the world was essential to my mental health.<p>I try to be mindful that the relationship between my work and my person &#x2F; identity is one of many such relationships in life, and maybe even not the most important one. I think that mindset makes it easier to accept criticism or even to reject it when I think it is irrelevant, misguided, or malicious, as unfortunately workplace criticism can sometimes be.<p>If your work is being fairly criticized, it&#x27;s an opportunity to learn and grow. Take it as a compliment that someone actually cared enough about your professional development to offer advice on how to be better. It means they already think that you&#x27;re good and worthy of improvement. On the other hand, be willing to accept the possibility that that criticism is not actually constructive but intended specifically to make you feel guilty or ashamed. Unfortunately, some people are just petty, small-minded, and manipulative, and will do anything to make you feel small in order for them to feel big.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36056761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36056761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">latexr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36068443">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36068118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36056761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36056761">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Kudos on the realisation and desire to improve. There are a couple of tricks you can use, especially when it’s asynchronous textual communication:<p>Assume positive intentions from the other person. Imagine them as having written with a genuine smile on their faces. Don’t think of it as them versus you, but you and them together against the problem. That defaults ambiguity to the more pleasant side and allows you to reply in a kind manner in turn. In general you get out of a conversation what you put into it, so add kindness.<p>That doesn’t mean you have to take abuse. But even if someone is unambiguously disrespectful (e.g. name calling) you can generally be respectful when pointing that out or simply not respond. Instead of wasting brain cycles getting more angry as you write the perfect zinger, let it go and you’ll forget about it soon enough. Focus on feeling better, never on making the other person feel worse.<p>If you do have to reply, don’t do so immediately. Let it marinate and respond when your initial feeling has subsided. That allows you to get some emotional distance between yourself and your work, thus seeing (and fixing) the problem in <i>the thing</i> not yourself. Waiting has the secondary effect that another person may reply in the interim, shifting the burden away.<p>When you feel bad, stop to think. Observe your own reaction and calmly try to realise why you’re feeling that way and what’s your goal. The introspection alone can make you see that the situation is unimportant and thus taking it personally is disproportionate.<p>The first few times might be hard but eventually it becomes second nature as you adapt and find the approach that works best for you.</div><br/><div id="36067572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36067572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pupppet</span><span>|</span><a href="#36056761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36067861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36067572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36067572">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Stopping myself from replying immediately has saved my bacon more than a few times.</div><br/><div id="36067716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36067716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lytefm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36056761">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36067572">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36067861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36067716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36067716">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Another good approach: Write down that email&#x2F; message in a text editor but just leave it there for a day.<p>Often, I&#x27;d realize that I don&#x27;t want to send it at all.

I&#x27;m also quite bad at not getting emotional by criticism and this is what I usually do too.<p>I would add that it&#x27;s better to  throw away the idea that &quot;after some training, eventually you won&#x27;t react badly to criticism&quot; is something you&#x27;ll achieve. Some people (like me) didn&#x27;t really stop reacting badly to criticism, but just found a system&#x2F;coping mechanism to channel that emotional reaction in a healthy way.<p>Another practical advice is to write down the criticism you got <i>when you got it</i>. Even if you got the criticism over text, the practice of writing (summarizing) the criticism received <i>when</i> you&#x27;re under your emotional reaction  will slow down your thought-process (you write slower than you think) and you&#x27;ll also have material (something <i>you</i> wrote) later when you&#x27;re more calm. Re-reading the criticism later from the person that gave it to you, might stir the negative emotions again and start a vicious cycle, so something written by you is a good intermediate to stop that, and detach the message from the person.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36068110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36068110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ctack</span><span>|</span><a href="#36056761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36067861">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36067841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36068110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36068110">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wise and well worded response here.<p>Only addition that I might make is that if the reviewer has taken the time to deeply understand your problem space and reply, they have given their time and energy and in a very real sense that is a gift.

Are the most skilled&#x2F;experienced&#x2F;respected the first to point out when they made a mistake?  How do managers&#x2F;leads react when learning of a mistake?  Do you feel a general sentiment like mistakes are human, and that everyone i supporting each other and wants everyone to succeed?  (This might not be just you, but something the company can improve.)<p>* Do you have a feeling about how your skills&#x2F;performance relate to the needs&#x2F;expectations of the team?  Do you feel like you&#x27;re appreciated enough?  Do you feel the Impostor Syndrome?  How does your current experience level fit in your team or company?<p>* You said &quot;unintentionally snarky&quot;, but do you ever feel that someone is being mean, overly critical, or disrespecting?  What about that being your initial reaction, and then later you decide it was unintentional?<p>* Do you feel like the <i>perception of others</i> when you make a mistake threatens your future?<p>* Do your thoughts seem to be mostly about meeting your own internal expectations of yourself, not so much what others think?  Were you raised with high expectations put on you?<p>* Have you worked with a therapist&#x2F;counselor on this?  I&#x27;d think it&#x27;ll take them awhile to get enough context about your work situation, but that&#x27;s normal, and they have a lot of relevant training and experience that we don&#x27;t.  Your health insurance probably covers this.<p>* Have you talked about it with a <i>trusted</i> colleague where you work, maybe a <i>trusted</i> manager?

It has very little to do with the day to day business of getting things done. The more elaborate the management system, the more intrusive it is to getting things done. A good manager doesn&#x27;t look to blame people for problems - they do whatever is required to help each person solve problems, period.<p>So when you get blamed for things that aren&#x27;t your fault, don&#x27;t take that personally. It&#x27;s not about you, it&#x27;s about that person&#x27;s insecurity about their job and need to deflect attention from themselves.<p>As far as snarky comments go, well... again, it&#x27;s not about you, it&#x27;s about the other person and <i>their</i> need to feel or look superior, or to make people think they&#x27;re funny, or it&#x27;s compulsive. Unless this same person singles you out constantly, it&#x27;s probably not personal.<p>As for feeling bad about honest mistakes... the only mistake you should ever feel bad about is the one you keep making. Everyone makes mistakes - some of us are just better at bullshitting about it. The key is to learn from them, and what questions to ask in advance to avoid them. That&#x27;s just a thing that takes experience.<p>Eventually you&#x27;ll get to the point where you don&#x27;t take it personally anymore than you take it personally if you go on a blind date and the person doesn&#x27;t fall instantly in love with you. Does it mean you&#x27;re not lovable? No. It means that, at this moment, that person didn&#x27;t want you. Again, it has nothing to do with <i>you</i>, and it doesn&#x27;t even necessarily mean anybody did anything wrong. That reviewer might have had a shitty day, or might be under undue pressure themselves. Doesn&#x27;t make it right to use you as a scapegoat, but that&#x27;s just the world. People aren&#x27;t always smart or fair.<p>As long as they don&#x27;t fire you, you&#x27;ll just learn to shine it on after a while.

Your skin may still be hit, but not your soul.<p>Secondly, if somebody says something that you dont agree with but is not really important or interesting, or even snarky, don’t respond. Just ignore it. Respond to another comment (if present) thay you do find constructive and interesting. This is very powerful because you actually respond to the snarky comments without responding. This can sometimes be the loudest and best response. Don’t waste energy where there is no gain.<p>It helps. Remember also that finding flaws is a lot easier than creating things, especially if new ideas are involved. Also remember that love makes blind; it’s easy to fall in love with one’s own ideas&#x2F;solutions and so ignoring its shortcomings. The easiest to fool is yourself. But that’s fine if you allow yourself to adjust.<p>Finally, allow yourself to be convinced. If somebody has a good argument against your case, give them a little credit.

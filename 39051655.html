Back in 2007, Google would&#x27;ve been in the middle of the the Viacom vs YouTube lawsuit. The whole idea of a search engine is fundamentally about taking all of the useful and mostly copyrighted content out there owned by others and profiting off of it by becoming the gateway to it.<p>OpenAI, similarly, works by taking all of the text and art and everything in the world, most of it owned by others, then copying it, collating it, and compressing it down into a model. Then they provide access to it in novel ways.  I make no representation about whether it&#x27;s legal or ethical.

Saying that something &quot;provides access to copyrighted content&quot; almost implies that there&#x27;s some mechanism that allows the user to wholesale download complete, unedited and exact copies of some copyrighted material - I could see that argument with a search engine, but not really with a text or image generator.</div><br/><div id="39052876" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052876" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saiya-jin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052144">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052774">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052965">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052876">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052876">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, you certainly have right to your opinion, as do others to theirs.

Josh Hawley, a Republican working with Blumenthal on AI legislation, agreed. “It shouldn’t be that just because the biggest companies in the world want to gobble up your data, they should be able to do it,” he said.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;congress-senate-tech-companies-pay-ai-training-data&#x2F;#intcid=_wired-right-rail_7c5d364a-988f-4fa9-9717-ddbe9df8d8b5_popular4-1-reranked-by-vidi_fallback_cral-top2-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;congress-senate-tech-companies-p...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39052279" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052279" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ulfw</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052144">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052192">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052301">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052279">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052279">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t see Google&#x27;s board fire it&#x27;s CEO and then he gets reinstated and basically fires the board.<p>Instead Google had more drama with the inappropriate behavior kind.</div><br/><div id="39052319" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052319" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CSSer</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052144">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052279">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052319">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052319">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be fair one could argue that was still in vogue at the time…</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39052767" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052767" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">choppaface</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052144">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052152">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052192">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052767">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052767">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Notably Google is currently doing layoffs while simultaneously paying Deepmind &#x2F;

The answer probably should be that Google should buy up startups that have figured out product-market fit and just need to scale. They can’t do that though because the FTC is already breathing down their neck with anti-trust suits.<p>Google actually is investing in a lot of very transformative technologies—AI obviously, but also quantum computers, biotech, and autonomous vehicles. Those are things that just aren’t well very well suited to 20% projects.</div><br/><div id="39052069" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052069" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voiceblue</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052058">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052233">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052069">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052069">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The success of 20% projects is a quasi-myth.

Just being able to spin up a separate copy may not mean much in terms of keeping a product alive past Google’s interest if the data is locked away behind Google’s private data stores.

When employees feel truly valued (which is rare!), it creates psychological safety, high morale, productivity, and creativity. Early employees would often encourage each other to &quot;fail fast&quot; as a means to innovation, but that&#x27;s no longer easy in an environment where failure implies a layoff. If you&#x27;re someone building a company, challenge yourself to value employees above all else, then watch and be amazed at the ROI.<p>This paragraph (which is the ending one) feels like it is contradicting the rest of the article. Because if those things really led to an awesome ROI, then Google would not be where it is now, but in a much better position than before. I guess?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not against valuing employees above everything else, but if this becomes too extreme maybe it&#x27;s normal that the company creates too much fragmentation? For example, why did Google create both Go and Dart? Shouldn&#x27;t they converge into one? (Shouldn&#x27;t Flutter have been written in Go?)

During my last days at X (formerly known as Twitter :P), everyone was just risk averse because it automatically meant a middle of the night firing. So much engineering time was wasted on non productive stuff, that could otherwise be spent on generating more profits for the company. Somehow management wanted you to constantly work towards making more money, while also punishing you for executing on ideas because it was taking you longer than 2 weeks to build and therefore were not working on something that made money immediately.<p>Edit: it’s not just innovation that takes a hit, it creates a lot of behaviors that are counterproductive for the company. People hoard information to make themselves irreplaceable, a very small percentage of psychopaths actively sabotage others, people steal ideas and have multiple competing groups work on the same thing, people refrain from raising issues that later create bigger problems, people only work on shiny new things that have the leadership’s blessing while dumping their unstable tech debt on others etc.</div><br/><div id="39052143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052133">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052110">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like their internal interest rates have gone up?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39052110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neom</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052133">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052110">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reminds me of the recent blog post by Sir Adrian Cockcroft.<p>Signs that it’s time to leave a company…

In a typical company, when priorities shift, you &quot;downsize&quot; (or cancel) a project, and then use the money to add people to a different, more important project. The common way to do this is fire people from the first project, then rehire a bunch of new people in the second project. It&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s expected.<p>This is funny for me as a German, because here as a company you are not allowed to fire people essentially on a whim - you have to find new roles for them in the company, and can only lay off people if you can&#x27;t reasonably do so. Obviously you can try nevertheless but if you can&#x27;t prove in front of a court that you did reasonable effort, then you&#x27;ll lose.<p>And that email quote is also interesting on its own:<p>&gt; Even the IT department works differently. In every building, there are little offices called &quot;tech stops&quot;. They sort of look like miniature computer stores. If you have a problem with your computer, just walk it right into the tech stop and show a technician. They generally help you on the spot. If you need hardware, just ask. &quot;Hey, I need a new mouse&quot;... &quot;sure, what kind would you like?&quot;, says the tech, opening a cabinet full of peripherals. No bureaucracy, no forms, no requests. Just ask for hardware, and get it. The same goes for office supplies... cabinets full of office supplies everywhere, always stocked full. Just take what you need, whenever you feel like it.<p>I think that in the end all this bureaucracy is part of what makes people feel like they&#x27;re just another cog in the machine, and it&#x27;s <i>intended</i> to do so. Just think about it from the outside... a company that pays you 60k a year, but adds about 100$ worth of &quot;management overhead&quot; for a simple mouse for 15 €? It certainly shows that you, or anyone else, isn&#x27;t to be trusted even with minuscule amounts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

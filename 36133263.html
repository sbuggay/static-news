There&#x27;s an entire category of developers who view the IDE and the language as a perfect hermetically sealed environment, until they meet a leaky abstraction.<p>Some favourites:<p>1. Depleting the outbound TCP ports because ports aren&#x27;t infinite and the code didn&#x27;t know that.<p>2. Any nodejs BS that involves a precompiled C lib, where homebrew or some nonsense &#x27;just works&#x27; on the dev machine but prod runs alpine&#x2F;musl. NPM sneaking arch specific blobs in is really to blame here but what do we expect from the failed state of package managers.<p>3. Assuming latency is not a thing. Network calls everywhere. No management of timeouts &#x2F; killed connections.<p>4. Memory, in all shapes and forms. Most typically thinking a GC prevents memory leaks, but more generally, having no clue whatsoever what the memory usage profile of the application is.<p>A systems engineer (IMO) has much better answers to these questions than a regular developer, and it is absolutely mostly arcane nonsense, (ulimit anyone?), until it isn&#x27;t.<p>Personally I love OS tech so maybe I&#x27;m just cut out for it. I used to be able to tell what the machine was doing from the HDD whirrs and still have a &#x27;feel&#x27; for system latency, e.g. when something completes too quickly.</div><br/><div id="36135371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36135371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sph</span><span>|</span><a href="#36134050">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36134794">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36135371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36135371">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s the type of job I enjoy doing!<p>After 17 years in this career, I dislike calling myself a &quot;software engineer&quot; because it&#x27;s a meaningless term that now is used to describe anyone that knows how to build a web page. &quot;Full-stack engineer&quot; has also been stolen from us by recruiter to refer to frontend devs. WTF.<p>As a teenager I started doing software interfacing with hardware, reversing on Windows then I wrote my own mini OS, got a job and did web dev, sysadmin, backend, infrastructure, and CTO, alongside dozens of consulting contracts.<p>I get hired to fix a problem, and soon enough I&#x27;m diving into the technicalities of the network stack, or tracking down a bottleneck with spit and strace, or scaling an infrastructure horizontally and making it fault tolerant.<p>At this point most of the value I provide is not in the volume of code I deliver, but designing, operating and maintaining systems as a whole. A systems engineer, if you like, but as the article mentions, that&#x27;s a real qualification that&#x27;s got nothing to do with this.<p>The issues is that in the job market I have to compete with everyone called a software engineer, slap a senior to it, which these days refers to anyone that has 5 years of experience, and feel it&#x27;s very hard to convey to a recruiter the depth of my experience.

I found a bug the other week which was slowing some important code down by 20x. I found the problem because it was tweaking my intuition. It just didn’t make sense that this code was so slow. After a few nights lying in bed thinking about it, I did some back of the napkin math which agreed with my intuition. Eventually I took some time to track it down. It turned out a rogue debug assertion hidden in a big function was making it into production. The assertion did a deep scan of the system to check invariants, and that turned an O(n) into an O(n^2) in some cases.<p>This sort of thing comes up a lot while programming. Something weird happens and you start to wonder - why <i>does</i> it behave like this? Answering these questions has led me all sorts of places - to reading specs, debugging into databases, compiling my own Firefox, all sorts of things. The chance this knowledge pays off sooner or later is wildly high.<p>Computers are deterministic and debugable.

Icon-Button-Click-Area: Click on the STAR (Panel Type) I can only activate it via putting the mouse cursor at the left bottom of icon&#x2F;button. Putting my cursor RIGHT on top in the middle does not activate it.<p>2. Panel-Split: Not sure if its related to 1, but I could only ever managed to figure out how to split my left horizontally plane once. Trying to split the right panel also like this, proved to be impossible (for me)<p>3. Sluggish-Feel: This could def be related to 1, but there seems to be a general delay between action(if it fires) and visual feedback<p>Suggestions:<p><pre><code>  * Re-look at GUI and make it more predictable&#x2F;familiar in terms of interaction 
  (click-area, feedback,speed)

  * Templates-For-Tab: Would be nice when creating a new tab, I could pre-select from a few templates, silly examples follows:

   - 4 box splits),
   - 2 vertical splits,
   - 3-splits (image, code, text)
</code></pre>
b) GUI-Feedback: Just to make it feel more responsive.<p>c) Use-Cases: I do like the free-form-thinking with wide constraints ntoe taking idea. I can even see it being used for: WebToon-Layouts, Storyboards, User-Testing, Use-Cases etc.<p>Again Congrats On Launching !

Thanks for the GUI feedback, Ill take a look at it, user testing did not report that particular issue (or for me in chrome) but I will definitely test it with different browser settings (Thanks for the edit, Ill check that). Layout issues, yeah, Plus button will open the bottom panel, and you can close it with the Minus button on that bottom panel. That&#x27;s all like 2 main, 2 expandable on the bottom!<p>Awesome, template idea is really great.
Yeah sluggishness is notable, ill need to fix it! 
Apologize for the bad experience, But appreciate all the inputs!

Congrats on launching this. I played around the site a bit and with the different panels.. a few thoughts&#x2F;questions...<p>THOUGHTS<p>1. Target: Is the market for enterprise&#x2F;work or for consumer&#x2F;personal use or does it not matter? Similar question for people, is it more for people who need diagrams in combination with notes and if so, are these mostly technical people who could author both the notes &#x2F; diagrams and for non-technical people who would read&#x2F;consume them?<p>2. All-In-One: The inevitable question&#x2F;concern on a tool that combines many things into one, is that, it being good but not great at any one thing. This is something I&#x27;m also dealing with on one my projects. How do you address this concern?<p>3. Limitations: Are there any limitations with the note taking, or the diagramming capabilities compared to specialized products &#x2F; apps like Joplin, UpNote, Bear, or Draw.io ?<p>QUESTIONS<p>1. Tab: Is a &quot;tab&quot; analogous to a &quot;note&quot; in other apps?<p>2. Panels: Are all the panels linked to a tab and is there a limit to the panels?<p>3. Folders: I didn&#x27;t quite get it, but how are multiple notes organized into 1 collection?<p>4. Diagrams: Do you have an example of a sophisticated diagram made with your app?<p>I use diagramming quite often, but it&#x27;s mostly for work purposes for technical software architecture diagrams, which I eventually embed into other wiki pages and&#x2F;or git readmes. For personal use at home, I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had to diagram anything. The first thing that comes to mind is how does the diagramming compare to something more specialized like draw.io. I can definitely see potential in this for work purposes.<p>All the Best!</div><br/><div id="41097514" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41097514" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zameermfm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41096160">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41098536">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41097514">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41097514">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks! feedback greatly appreciated.
Answers, for Questions:
1. Cluster of 4 panels is a tab, it can be 4 streams of notes, or 4 different types of modes - Diagramming&#x2F;Codes etc. Or even 1 note but whole organization is a tab.
2. There is a limit, yes, right now only 4 panels are workable.
3. You can have unlimited tabs within a collection, it is for the &#x27;separation of concern&#x27; where you would want to separate your things completely.
4. I do for features in my day job as a dev, yes. But sophisticated - may be not, but they are small features.<p>Thoughts:
1. I had to personalize for set of people, coding editors aren&#x27;t used by non technical works.
2. I&#x27;m personally looking for people&#x27;s inputs on this, thanks! My focus on developers in one such start.
3. Also welcome all your input on this, apart from the aesthetics, I didn&#x27;t see any limitations.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41098536" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41098536" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">getcrunk</span><span>|</span><a href="#41096160">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41097779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41098536">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41098536">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Dang congrats!<p>I had a very similar idea for going on a decade now , but never got around to working on it until a few weeks ago.

Def. the kind of tool where that is possible.<p>&gt; Many note-taking apps today single-paged have high-think-threshold (windows notepad&#x2F;apple notes have very low-think-threshold), you have to think before you write in them, so not a good option for quick ideas.<p>It&#x27;s good that you are identifying competitors &#x2F; alternative solutions; but &quot;thinking before writing in them&quot; is not a pain i think most users would connect with, nor is your platform in any way changing this dynamic of interaction. So it feels like a reach.<p>The UI looks good, but there are some UX frustrations. to me this overall does too much - there are too many things. It&#x27;s good they are tucked away in menus but it is overthought to the point of being overwhelming. But...could possibly be addressed via different progressive disclosure.<p>I can see how&#x2F;why you might use it. but for me it is not the right &quot;it&quot;. It&#x27;s also not &quot;for devs&quot; in the way you maybe want it to be as a platform. That all but kills it for me. I don&#x27;t think that as a premise has a market.<p>Also, the split panel as a design decision feels constraining. Who are you to tell me how to use your software? And with them being the same objects it just feels redundant or like I&#x27;m expected to type with the left and right hands separately. But with a different start state and maybe using two different panels you could create more &#x27;ah-ha&quot;.<p>I would lean into making this like a jsfiddle where it&#x27;s low friction to generate things and share it with others.

I played with it for a little while, and while I found some issues like the code blocks inserted with `&#x2F;` not automatically sizing to fit the content, and showing an alert() when switching panel types even when a panel hasn&#x27;t been edited, I think it works pretty well for how ambitious of an app it is.<p>I like being able to do things side by side. However, I think perhaps the tabs should be within each split. It also should be geared towards quickly opening and closing things. A low entropy split view will result in space being taken up by stuff that isn&#x27;t relevant. This is why the split view in Visual Studio Code works pretty well. It&#x27;s like a browser where the tabs are constantly changing - not like Excel where you delete tabs but don&#x27;t close them and they&#x27;re persisted across sessions including the order of the tabs. (Actually, Excel has a split view but it works because you can quickly change which tab is open in each split, so it&#x27;s relevant to the task at hand.)<p>&gt; Many note-taking apps today single-paged have high-think-threshold<p>Like Notion and Obsidian?

Even allowing for arbitrarily small turtles, the total height of the infinite stack will be just 2x the height of the first layer.<p>Point being, some series converge to a finite result, including some defined recursively.

Iâm not sure it would be so easy to sell these tools to enterprise organisations if you outlined that they are basically just very good at being lucky. With the abstraction of hallucinations you sort of put into language why your tool is sometimes very wrong.<p>To me the real danger comes from when the models get things wrong but also correct at the same time. Not so much in software engineering, I doubt your average programmer without LLM tools will write âbetterâ code without getting some bad answers. What consents me is more how non-technical departments implement LLMs into their decision making or analysis systems.<p>Done right, itâll enhance your capabilities. We had a major AI project in cancer detection, and while it actually works it also doesnât really work on its own. Obviously it was meant to enhance the regular human detection and anyone involved with the project screamed this loudly at any chance they got. Naturally it was seen as an automation process by the upper management and all the humans parts of the process were basically replacedâ¦ until a few years later when we had a huge scandal about how the AI worked as it was meant to do, which wasnât to be on its own. Today it works along side the human detection systems and their quality is up. It took people literally dying to get that point through.<p>Maybe it wouldâve happened this way anyway if the mistakes werenât sort of written into this technical issue we call hallucinations. Maybe it wouldnât. From personal experience with getting projects to be approved, I think abstractions are always a great way to hide the things you donât want your decision makers to know.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40816239" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816239" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Affric</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814847">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40818516">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816239">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816239">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The AI companies donât want you âanthropomorphisingâ the models because it would put them at risk of increased liability.<p>You will be told that linear algebra is just a model and the fact that epistemology has never turned up a decent result for what knowledge is will be ignored.<p>We are meant to believe that we are somehow special magical creatures and that the behaviour of our minds cannot be modelled by linear algebra.</div><br/><div id="40818368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40818368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ben_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814847">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816239">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40818360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40818368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40818368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t see how anthropomorphism reduces liability.<p>If a company does a thing that&#x27;s bad, it doesn&#x27;t matter much if the work itself was performed by a blacksmith or by a robot arm in a lights-off factory.<p>&gt; We are meant to believe that we are somehow special magical creatures and that the behaviour of our minds cannot be modelled by linear algebra<p>I only hear this from people who say AI will never reach human level; of AI developers that get press time, only LeCun seems so dismissive (though I&#x27;ve not actually noticed him making this specific statement, I can believe he might have).</div><br/></div></div><div id="40818360" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40818360" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duggan</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814847">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816239">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40818368">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816364">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40818360">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40818360">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, youâre just meant not to assert that linear algebra is equivalent to any process in the human brain, when the human brain is not understood well enough to draw that conclusion.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40816364" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40816364" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p1esk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814847">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816239">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816697">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40816364">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40816364">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>It&#x27;s just a word meaning AI gives wrong answer.</i><p>No, itâs more specific than just wrong.<p>Hallucination is when a model creates a bit of fictitious knowledge, and uses that knowledge to answer a question.</div><br/><div id="40817315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40817315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">olalonde</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814847">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40816364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40818040">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40817315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40817315">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you give an example of a &quot;wrong&quot; answer vs an &quot;hallucinated&quot; answer?</div><br/><div id="40818552" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40818552" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stefanve</span><span>|</span><a href="#40814847">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817945">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40818552">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40818552">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">there are many types of a wrong answer, and the difference is based on how the answer came to be.

If an LLM makes a statement that is not supported by the training data (either because it doesn&#x27;t exist or because the equivalent correct statement is more strongly supported), I think that&#x27;s an issue with the implementation of the model.

They initially pitched it as a &quot;safety&quot; measure (and I think if it wasn&#x27;t obvious immediately how nonsensical a claim that is, it should at least be apparent now that the company&#x27;s shucked nearly the entire subset of its members that claimed to care about &quot;AI safety&quot; that this is not a priority)<p>The idea of RLHF as a mechanism for tuning models based on the principle that humans might have some hard-to-capture insight that could steer them independent of the way they&#x27;re normally trained is the very best steelman for its value I could come up with. This aim is directly subverted by trying to use another language model to influence the human rater, so from my perspective it really brings us back to square one on what the fuck RLHF is supposed to be doing<p>Really, a lot of this comes down to what these models do versus how they are being advertised. A generative language model produces plausible prose that follows from the prompt it receives. From this, the claim that it should write working code is actually quite a bit stronger than the claim that it should write true facts, because plausibile autocompletion will learn to mimic syntactic constraints but actually has very little to do with whether something is true, or whatever proxy or heuristic we may apply in place of &quot;true&quot; when assessing information (supported by evidence, perhaps. Logically sound, perhaps. The distinction between &quot;plausible&quot; and &quot;true&quot; is in many ways the whole point of every human epistemology). Like if you ask something trained on all human writing whether the Axis or the Allies won WWII, the answer will depend on whether you phrased the question in a way that sounds like Phillip K Dick would write it. This isn&#x27;t even incorrect behavior by the standards of the model, but people want to use these things like some kind of oracle or to replace google search or whatever, which is a misconception about what the thing does, and one that&#x27;s very profitable for the people selling it</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40813914" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40813914" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vhiremath4</span><span>|</span><a href="#40813477">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40813852">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815690">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40817185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40813914">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40813914">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is kind of what I was thinking.

These include, for instance, court systems. These include a notion of evidentiary standards. Eyewitnesses are treated as more reliable than hearsay. Written or taped recordings are more reliable than both. Multiple witnesses who agree are more reliable than one. Another example is science. Science utilizes peer review, along with its own notion of hierarchy of evidence, similar to but separate from the court&#x27;s. Interventional trials are better evidence than observational studies. Randomization and statistical testing is used to try and tease out effects from noise. Results that replicate are more reliable than a single study. Journalism is yet another example. This is probably the arena in which Hacker News is most cynical and will declare all of it is useless trash, but nonetheless reputable news organizations do have methods they use to try and be correct more often than they are not. They employ their own fact checkers. They seek out multiple expert sources. They send journalists directly to a scene to bear witness themselves to events as they unfold.<p>You&#x27;re free to think this isn&#x27;t sufficient, but this is how we deal with humans making up stuff and it&#x27;s gotten us modern civilization at least, full of warts but also full of wonders, seemingly because we&#x27;re actually right about a lot of stuff.<p>At some point, something analogous will presumably be the answer for how LLMs deal with this, too. The training will have to be changed to make the system aware of quality of evidence. Place greater trust in direct sensor output versus reading something online. Place greater trust in what you read from a reputable academic journal versus a Tweet. Etc. As it stands now, unlike human learners, the objective function of an LLM is just to produce a string in which each piece is in some reasonably high-density region of the probability distribution of possible next pieces as observed from historical recorded text. Luckily, producing strings in this way happens to generate a whole lot of true statements, but it does not have truth as an explicit goal and, until it does, we shouldn&#x27;t forget that. Treat it with the treatment it deserves, as if some human savant with perfect recall had never left a dark room to experience the outside world, but had read everything ever written, unfortunately without any understanding of the difference between reading a textbook and reading 4chan.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40814776" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40814776" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CooCooCaCha</span><span>|</span><a href="#40812867">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40812930">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40815037">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40812993">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40814776">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40814776">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If I am going to trust a machine then it should perform at the level of a very competent human, not a general human.<p>Why would I want to ask your average person a physics question?

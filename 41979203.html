I&#x27;m still not convinced of these &quot;write whole block of code for me&quot; type of use case. Here&#x27;s my arguments against the videos from the article.<p>1. Snake case to camelCase. Even without AI we can already complete these tasks easily. VSCode itself has command of &quot;Transform to Camel Case&quot; for selection. It is nice the AI can figure out which text to transform based on context, but not too impressive. I could select one &quot;:, use &quot;Select All Occurrences&quot;, press left, then ctrl+shift+left to select all the keys.<p>2. Generate boilerplate from documentation. Boilerplate are tedious, but not really time-consuming. How many of you spend 90% of time writing boilerplate instead of the core logic of the project? If a language&#x2F;framework (Java used to be, not sure about now) requires me to spend that much time on boilerplate, that&#x27;s a language to be ditched&#x2F;fixed.<p>3. Turn problem description into a block of concurrency code. Unlike the boilerplate, these code are more complicated. If I already know the area, I don&#x27;t need AI&#x27;s help to begin with. If I don&#x27;t know, how can I trust the generated code to be correct? It could miss a corner case that my question didn&#x27;t specify, which I don&#x27;t yet know existing myself. In the end, I still need to spend time learning Python concurrency, then I&#x27;ll be writing the same code myself in no time.<p>In summary, my experience about AI is that if the question is easy (e.g. easy to find exactly same question in StackOverflow), their answer is highly accurate. But if it is a unique question, their accuracy drops quickly. But it is the latter case where we spend most of the time on.</div><br/><div id="41980222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shinycode</span><span>|</span><a href="#41980089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980247">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree.<p>I replaced SO with cGPT and it’s the only good case I found. Finding an answer I build onto. But outsourcing my reflexion ? That’s a dangerous path. I tried on small projects to do that, building a project from scratch with cursor just to test it. Sometimes it’s right on spot but in many instances it misses completely some cases and edge cases. Impossible to trust blindly. And if I do so and not take proper time to read and think about the code the consequences pile up and make me waste time in the long run because it’s prompt over prompt over prompt to refine it and sometimes it’s not exactly right. That messes up my thinking and I prefer to do it myself and use it as a documentation on steroids. I never used google and SO again for docs. I have the feeling that relying on it to much to write even small blocs of code will make us loose some abilities in the long run and I don’t think that’s a good thing. Will companies allow us to use AI in code interviews for boilerplate ?</div><br/></div></div><div id="41980247" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980247" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sateeshm</span><span>|</span><a href="#41980089">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980222">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980921">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980247">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980247">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Completely agree.

So, working with the AI, I asked it to convert the simulation to constant-time (it was currently locked to render path -- it&#x27;s over a decade old). Needless to say, it wrote code that set the simulation to be realtime ... in other words, we&#x27;d be waiting one year to see the planets go around the sun. After I pointed that out, it figured out what to do and still got things wrong or made some terrible readability decisions.

This is probably also where the hype comes from, feels like magic.<p>But the issue is, that once it gets slightly more complicated, thinks break apart and run into a dead end quickly. For example yesterday I wanted to build a simple CLI tool in Go (which is outstandingly friendly to LLM codegen as a language + stdlib) that acts as a simnple reverse proxy and (re-)starts the original thing in the background on file changes.<p>AI was able to knock out _something_ immediately that indeed compiled, only it didn&#x27;t actually work like intended. After lots of iterations back-and-forth (Claude mostly) the code balooned in size to figure out what could be the issue, adding all kinds of useless crap that kindof-looks-helpful-but-isn&#x27;t. After an hour I gave up and went through the whole code manually (few hundred lines, single file) and spotted the issue immediately (holding a mutex lock that gets released with `defer` doesn&#x27;t play well with a recursive function call). After pointing that out, the LLM was able to fix it and produced a version that finally worked - still with tons of crap and useless complexity everywhere. And thats a simple straightforward coding task that can be accomplished in a single file and only few hundred lines, greenfield style. And all my claude chat tokens of the day got burned for this, only for me at the end having to dig in myself.<p>LLMs are great to produce things in small limited scopes (especially boilerplate-y stuff) or refactor something that already exists, when it has enough context and essentially doesn&#x27;t really think about a problem but merely changes linguistic details (rewrites text to a different format ultimately) - its a large LANGUAGE model after all.<p>But full blown autonomous app building? Only if you do something that has been done exactly thousands of times before and is simple to begin with. There is lots of business value in that, though. Most programmers at companies don&#x27;t do rocket science or novel things at all. It won&#x27;t build any actual novelty - ideal case would be building an X for Y (like Uber For Catsitting) only but never an initial X.<p>Personal productivity of mine went through the roof since GPT4&#x2F;Cursor though, but I guess I know how&#x2F;when to use it properly. And developer demand will surge when the wave of LLM-coded startups get their funding and realize the codebase cannot be extended anymore with LLMs due to complexity and the raw amount of garbage in there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41980907" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980907" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">epolanski</span><span>|</span><a href="#41981025">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980907">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980907">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some uses I have, e.g. a notepad in Cursor with a predefined set of files and a prompt e.g. to implement storybook stories and documentation out of components I use.

They are just not good enough yet to use in real projects.

I use the latter much more. The &quot;intelligence level&quot; of the Chat is pretty poor and like the author says, starts with pointless code blocks, and you often end up with AI slop after a few minutes of back and forth.<p>Meanwhile, the Compose mode gives code changes a good shot either in one file or multiple, and you can easily direct it towards specific files. I do wish it could be a bit smarter about which files it looks at since unless you tell it about that file you have types in, it&#x27;ll happily reimplement types it doesn&#x27;t know of. And another big issue with Compose mode is that the product is just not really complete (as can be seen by how different the 3 UXes of applying edits are). It has reverted previous edits for me, even if they were saved on disk and the UI was in a fresh state (and even their &quot;checkout&quot; functionality lost the content).<p>The Cmd+K &quot;edit these lines&quot; mode has the most reliable behavior since it&#x27;s such a self-contained problem where the implementation uses the least amount of tricks to make the LLM faster. But obviously it&#x27;s also the least powerful.<p>I think it&#x27;s great that companies are trying to figure this out but it&#x27;s also clear that this problem isn&#x27;t solved. There is so much to do around how the model gets context about your code, how it learns about your codebase over time (.cursorrules is just a crutch), and a LOT to do about how edits to code are applied when 95% of the output of the model is the old code and you just want those new lines of code applied. (On that last one, there are many ways to reduce output from the LLM but they&#x27;re all problematic – Anthropic&#x27;s Fast Edit feature is great here because it can rewrite the file super fast, but if I understand correctly it&#x27;s way too expensive).</div><br/></div></div><div id="41980396" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980396" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">easyKL</span><span>|</span><a href="#41980489">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41980953">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980396">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980396">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Recent interview to Cursor developers:

I don&#x27;t know how to use these so I don&#x27;t.<p>I still intend to try cursor since my boss thinks it might improve productivity and thus wants me to see if that&#x27;s true, and I don&#x27;t want to be some kind of technophobe, however I remain skeptical that these built-in tools are at least any more useful than me just quickly opening a chatgpt window in my browser and pasting some code in, with the downside of me losing all my bindings.<p>My spacemacs config: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;komali2&#x2F;Configs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;.spacemacs">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;komali2&#x2F;Configs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;.spacem...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41980123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Giorgi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41980193">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980123">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That article reads just like half-a--ed chatgpt prompt designed to shill Cursor because it became irrelevant after introduction of Canvas tool.</div><br/><div id="41980317" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41980317" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">NitpickLawyer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41980123">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41980317">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41980317">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; to shill Cursor because it became irrelevant after introduction of Canvas tool.<p>Haha, no. A web interface won&#x27;t make a full-fledged IDE irrelevant. Canvas is <i>really cool</i> for a quick session in the browser, when travelling, while in bed, on a plane, etc. It&#x27;s neat and works. But it&#x27;s nowhere near the IDE experience.<p>Cursor is still a full IDE in the background, with all the bells and whistles that come with it. So if you&#x27;re working on anything more complicated than one-off scripts, you&#x27;ll still benefit a lot from having it, over a web interface.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

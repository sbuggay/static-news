I periodically manually copy all of those to my computer: camera pictures, screenshots, downloads, WhatsApp or other app media and so on.<p>I then tag those with date&#x2F;event and compress the folders with 7-Zip. Those archives are then duplicated across 2 different local drives and 1 remote drive. I don&#x27;t really tag the contents or store other metadata apart from the event name, if one exists.<p>For videos about software development or YouTube&#x2F;Twitch streams, I render them with Kdenlive and put them on my PeerTube instance as acceptable quality backups. I actually needed those once because the OBS audio setup was messed up and YouTube only included my voice in some videos, not the computer&#x2F;other audio track.<p>In short, do the simplest thing that meets your needs, but ideally also have backups.

I use Photosync to move from phone to PC as it only moves new photos and sorts into folders.

This leaves me with a lower number of meaningful photos to be able to look back on (or be surfaced by the On This Day feature of OneDrive).<p>Non-personal photos, e.g. nature, graffiti, whatever go into a different folder with theme based sub-folders. This can mean that if I go on holiday somewhere I have photos of the family in a different place to photos of cool things that I saw but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after.

Some stuff gets organized, such as scans of old family photos, documents, faceplates, devices and so on. I have organized some in relation to the home and property should I sell.<p>Mainly, as I transfer from sd  cards, photos get ranked (not tagged or renamed) and the best make it to a &quot;gallery&quot; folder, or an &quot;illustration&quot; folder for posting on the other aggregator site I use. Only two for me.<p>The phone photos are transferred in giant blobs, so they never get sorted. I won&#x27;t host my photos outside the home because of the great internet copy machine and hacking plague. And so I have yet to find any desktop tech that will categorize photos even in the simplest way. iOS image search is insanely dumb and useless. It finds people, but the few other categories are not helpful to me and often hilariously wrong in identification.<p>I don&#x27;t use Apple&#x27;s photos app because in the past, it failed to do anything but create a giant album with phony virtual folders, and the underlying files were organized by date in a tree that made access to the actual files a fright. And with cryptic names.<p>So I organize, to the extent I do, in the simplest ways. A few categories, but otherwise, some big bags, and a &quot;best&quot; folder that I copy to the iPad Pro for showing off. No third party involved.

I started programming with optical mark cards which were much, much worse. I&#x27;d fill in bubbles on each card to make the program, mail the program to the Waterloo computer center, and get my output back in a week or so. After fixing the errors (either the bubble wasn&#x27;t dark enough or a coding error), I&#x27;d send the program back. It took me <i>weeks</i> to get my first program to run. Compared to that, punch cards were like living in the future.<p>By the way, if you want to experience punch cards in person, come to the Computer History Museum (Mountain View, CA) on Wednesdays or Saturdays for demos of the IBM 1401 and the opportunity to punch your own cards.

In my high school, there was an old keypunch machine used for school administration purposes. I had a friend that was able to submit any program I keypunched to the school district&#x27;s IBM computer; I never saw the computer but it&#x27;s likely that it was something like an IBM 1130. My my friend would bring the output back a couple of days later; so fixing even one typo required a few days.<p>This old keypunch machine was a model 026, not the much nicer model 029 that was ubiquitous while I was in college. The 026 had a very basic keyboard, see [1], one could punch the columnar code for the upper case letters and numerals along with a handful of symbols: #@,%$.&#x2F; and space. This isn&#x27;t enough to even program in early FORTRAN, the language I was trying to use.<p>To type say an equals sign one had to use the multi-punch key that allowed punching a combination of the basic symbols that would properly encode the equals sign. It was slow going. One mistake and the card (corresponding to a line of code) was ruined and had to be redone.<p>I had just finished reading a book on solving linear programming problems, which come up often in operations research, using the simplex algorithm (I still have this book too). Naturally, I decided that that would be the first program I ever wrote. That definitely wasn&#x27;t the best &quot;hello world&quot; program to try first. I wish I still had a listing of that program; it would be good for a few laughs.<p>The first <i>working</i> program I wrote printed out a table of sine and cosine values for angles from 0 to 90 degrees. The rest of my programs in high school were not much more sophisticated. I was just trying to learn it on my own as a hobby. I still own my book on Fortran that I bought with my newspaper route income back then, McCracken&#x27;s book on Fortran IV [2].<p>A couple of years later I got to write more serious programs and used the IBM 029 keypunch machines that were a lot better. Programs got long enough (hundreds of lines!!) that card management became important. Sturdy cardboard boxes or even long metal drawers designed for holding the stacks of cards were the main tool for source code management.<p>In college, I was able to use IBM&#x27;s data processing equipment for punching line numbers in columns 73-80 on each card (these columns are ignored by FORTRAN IV); this allowed dropped cards to be sorted back into order through a series of passes (one for each digit of line number) on IBM card sorting machines. This was my introduction to radix sorting, [3].<p>One complication when numbering cards was inserted new code between existing cards. Because of this, my initial punching of line numbers in columns 73-80 had to be done with gaps, usually I&#x27;d leave one or two zeros at the end of each card number. However, to get the auto numbering machine to do this required pulling out a large (1 foot square) plug board from the equipment and physically connecting jacks with switchboard like cables to make the equipment count by hundreds and punch in columns 73 through 80.<p>It was all quite primitive. But one did learn to review code carefully before submitting it for being run.<p>Grad school was better, I still frequently used FORTRAN punched on cards, but I was also able to use the mainframe in a timesharing environment where I used TECO as my text editor at a terminal, there must have been around twenty of these terminals connected to the CDC 6400, [4].<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.edu&#x2F;cu&#x2F;computinghistory&#x2F;026-keyboard.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.edu&#x2F;cu&#x2F;computinghistory&#x2F;026-keyboard.jpg</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;guidetofortraniv00mccr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;guidetofortraniv00mccr</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibm-1401.info&#x2F;KensSorter&#x2F;type83-a.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibm-1401.info&#x2F;KensSorter&#x2F;type83-a.jpg</a><p>[4] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsavers.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;cdc&#x2F;cyber&#x2F;cyber_70&#x2F;kronos&#x2F;60407600B_KRONOS2.1ug_May74.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsavers.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;cdc&#x2F;cyber&#x2F;cyber_70&#x2F;kronos&#x2F;60407...</a></div><br/><div id="38166156" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38166156" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">commandersaki</span><span>|</span><a href="#38165950">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38165943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38166156">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38166156">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When you program FORTRAN with punch cards, does the computer run the program and provide the output, or is there an intermediate step of having the compiled executable output which you then need to feed back into the computer?</div><br/><div id="38170739" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38170739" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dboreham</span><span>|</span><a href="#38165950">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38166156">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38166340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38170739">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38170739">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Note, I never actually used punch cards, but they existed when I was in college.

You wrapped the form around your card deck, secured with a rubber band and placed the assembled package into a box&#x2F;shelf in the entrance to said computer center.<p>4. You went about your business for a day or so.<p>5. You checked your pigeon hole outside the computer center, or perhaps your department mailbox.<p>6.

And while you could wrap up your deck and drop if off at the computer center to be run, it was likely better to take it to the lab to that had the RJE (Remote Job Entry) terminal which had a card reader and a line printer.<p>Jon’s submitted there would print out on the line printer, but the printer could be used by others as well, so there was typically a queue of printouts that you had to wait for. But in general, the RJE lab had the fastest turnaround.<p>I remember my friend playing Lunar Lander. He had the Fortran source code, and would add a new burn card, and run the deck through. He’d go over the output, add another card, and run it again. This was the process, but not necessarily an efficient use of paper.<p>Now, there were also folks that were not programmers, but rather students and professors using tools like SPSS (a statistical package).<p>A student assignment deck was typically 1-2 inches thick. Not much code, not much data. But these researchers, they had decks measured in feet. They’d carry them around using small carts and hand trucks. The cards were in cardboard trays. Most of that was data. Largest set I saw was probably 10 feet long of cards.<p>They took their sweet time being run through the feeder. Just grab a chunk, and put it in. As it fed, pile on some more. No rush, it’s an input device, it’ll wait for more cards as you moved the read cards out and fed more in.

These cards, no matter how many, are of absolutely no value unless they are in the correct sequence. Think about that.<p>When I was learning to program we had decks of cards. Each deck was wrapped in between 10 and 20 rubber bands because the very last thing you wanted was to spill the cards on the floor. One time I went into the little room where you submitted your job - a stack of rubber-banded punch cards - by placing it on the desk. Then you waited until it &quot;ran&quot; and they gave you back your stack.<p>Some guy came in and placed a deck, maybe 200 cards, on the desk, but WITHOUT any rubber bands.

The last few columns were ignored and you could punch a sequence number. If you dropped your deck of cards you could take it to a sorting machine that could rearrange them in increasing order of the sequence numbers.  The trick was to make your initial sequence number increase in steps of, say, 100.  Then if you later had to insert cards in the middle of the deck you could use intermediate sequence numbers.

He retired and I haven’t heard from him, but from what he told me, one’s experience with punch card systems varied greatly due to the size of the shop. In larger shops:<p>The programmer would typically write out the program with pencil and paper. He&#x2F;she would then pass that along to another programmer, possibly several, to have them review it and look for bugs.<p>The program would then be passed along to person who was skilled with a card punching machine and he&#x2F;she would get the program entered.<p>Once the program was on cards, the program would be run. The print out of the result would then be inspected to ensure the program ran successfully. Often, the programmers would rewire the output board to cache the output and allow multiple prints.

And a waiting period.  I remember coding somehow on a paper teletype in the WREK studios.  By the time I was finishing grad school 7 years later I was writing graphics code in $49 Turbo Pascal on my very own PC.  With an add-on 80287 co-processor, natch.  It was intoxicatingly awesome to sit down and code.  Beautifully powerful.  That&#x27;s an astounding amount of progress.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve changed my coding tools significantly over the last 15 years.  Emacs and c++ are better now, but the basic process &amp; language are pretty much the same.

So, one evening shift in Spring, we nipped over to our newly-opened &quot;social&quot; club, where we swiftly drank 3 pints or so of beer before dashing back to work. As soon as the mainframe room aircon hit me, I realised that the 10 boxes of punched cards of customers holiday bookings would be a challenge. I started the first box okay, then managed to drop the second and third boxes off the trolley. No problem, I just scooped up the cards off the floor and re-fed them - twice.

She also said that you just checked it over as much as possible and got good at not making many mistakes because of how tedious it was. From what I recall, she said her dept. was basically a 24hour operation.

However, people take it too far. The point is, does the candidate <i>use their brain</i> when using the tool, to use it to its full advantage?<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between programmers who:<p><pre><code>    - Just mindlessly step through the debugger
    - Do some groundwork so they know where to step
    - Has devious tricks, like writing a &quot;tripwire&quot; to activate a special 
      debugging version, and has the program find the bug.
</code></pre>
So I find people who have this bias against debuggers just silly. It&#x27;s not the tool that&#x27;s the deciding factor. It&#x27;s the programmer!<p>The same goes for writing new code and refactoring existing code. Does the programmer exercise their brain to utilize the tool to its fullest extent? The same even goes for prompt engineering and otherwise leveraging AI.<p>One shouldn&#x27;t just stop at the surface level of analysis. Look for underlying principles. Try to get to first principles!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38171460" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38171460" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ultraboom</span><span>|</span><a href="#38152547">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38170758">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38171460">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38171460">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The best thing about punch cards and FORTRAN was punching a &quot;C&quot; in column 80; then the statement could be commented-out simply by reversing the card.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38170758" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38170758" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dboreham</span><span>|</span><a href="#38171460">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38173647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38170758">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38170758">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a part of the 3h Dave Cutler interview where he talks about programming with punch cards: he became so frustrated at the jobs being rejected due to syntax errors that he wrote a program (run on a departmental computer with interactive access) to pre-check his card deck, allowing him to submit it clean to the mainframe.

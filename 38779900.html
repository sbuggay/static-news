So, what did he do?<p>&gt; Then in the 1320s, the abbey became embroiled in a feud involving £10,000, which, by today&#x27;s standards, would have been millions.<p>&gt; The monasteries at the time had political allegiances and at Malmesbury they supported a local noble family called the Despensers.<p>&gt; The family left a large amount of cash with the abbey for safekeeping.<p>&gt; However, when the tide turned against them, the head of the family was executed and the monastery decided to keep quiet about the money they had stored.<p>&gt; In the end though, the monks of Malmesbury were pardoned: &quot;Extraordinarily, the King took the 10,000 and let him off. Basically, they all got away with it.&quot;<p>So, the Despensers left money at the abbey.  They were then killed.  Presumably there were no survivors to return the money to.  Then the king comes and takes the 10k.<p>My question is, which person is the gangster?<p>The answer is the king!  Not the abbot.<p>In what world does the king have a rightful claim to the Despensers money?  Only in the one he writes the rules and calls the benefits he receives &#x27;right&#x27;.  So, gangster.<p>Tellingly, even now, all these centuries later, the BBC has to kowtow to this &quot;royal&quot; power.  Because that is the BBC&#x27;s job.  As it is for all mainstream media.<p>That&#x27;s my unpopular opinion anyway.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

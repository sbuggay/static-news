In some other languages, I often encounter situations where the development environment needs to be completely recreated—sometimes due to an updated interpreter version or other breaking changes. If you&#x27;ve been away from the codebase for a while, chances are you&#x27;ll need to make modifications just to get it running in a more recent environment.<p>With .NET, this issue is much less pronounced. While occasional adjustments are necessary, the environment is largely self-contained, minimizing the overhead required to get things running. As long as the .NET SDK is installed, running dotnet restore is usually all it takes—even when moving the codebase to an entirely new machine.<p>Some third-party libraries evolve more rapidly than others, but the core .NET libraries remain remarkably stable. More often than not, you can transition between major versions without needing to modify any code.<p>If I were starting a long-term project that required ongoing maintenance, C# would be my top choice. For quick scripting needs, I’d lean toward Python or PowerShell. In fact, PowerShell itself is another reason I appreciate .NET—it shares many concepts, and knowing .NET makes it easier to understand PowerShell. Plus, since PowerShell can directly leverage .NET libraries, it offers powerful scripting capabilities. I was thrilled when PowerShell became cross-platform, much like .NET itself.</div><br/><div id="42895093" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895093" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">billfruit</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895089">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895093">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895093">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The same is even better with Java.<p>It&#x27;s common to find Java binaries build 20 Years+ to run on present day systems without issue.</div><br/><div id="42895916" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895916" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">porcoda</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895008">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895093">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896632">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895916">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895916">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yup!  I recently took a pretty substantial project I wrote in 2006 in Java that was sitting in a tar file, unpacked it, and it ran just fine with a current JVM.  Even better, I was able to compile it again with no problems: again, with a modern JDK.  I wish I could say the same for years of projects written in Rust and Haskell: the Haskell ones are almost all bit rotten since I haven’t kept them up to date with GHC, and Rust is similar.  Those two are even worse since with Java I had a rich standard library, so I didn’t have any 3rd party dependencies in my 19 year old project.  The Haskell and Rust ones rely on Hackage and crates, and keeping things working for that long would require me to do bonus work beyond my actual project code.  I’ve had similar but less painful problems in Python land: the library APIs are mostly stable: the biggest headache there are projects that predate python3 so there’s some work to bring them up to date.  That’s at least a one time investment.<p>Java: no bonus work induced by third parties to keep projects alive, keeps working for a long time.

I know there are some differences in platform support, but most of the rough edges were handled in the early days of .NET Core 2 &amp; 3. Now that we&#x27;re way past that (the &quot;traditional&quot; .NET merged with .NET Core in a combined version 5 release). Now that it&#x27;s on version 9, the language features and low-level hits keep coming. I can, today, write code that is 99% of what you can get from C++ (and in some edge cases can exceed it), compiled to native code, that will run on Windows &amp; Linux (x64 &amp; arm64), BSD &amp; MacOS without too much trouble.<p>And as a fellow HNer pointed out the other day on an unrelated thread, the native interop is painless. You can load .dll, .so, .dylib files with ease. No frankenstein FFI (ala Go or Java).<p>The language is safe. GC can be avoided (or controlled), and it offers raw pointers, manual memory manipulation with spans, and more low-level features through the unsafe subset of functions.<p>I know people like to say this started as a rip-off of Java, and there is <i>some</i> truth to that, but I have too much respect for Anders to believe he set out to rip off Java part and parcel. There was a method to his madness, and from my perspective, C# has always been a step ahead in programmer ergonomics (but definitely not performance). Maybe that&#x27;s due to the sheer intertia of the Java ecosystem, or to Sun and then Oracle being more conservative, I don&#x27;t know. Hell, it probably had more to do with Microsoft&#x27;s reputation.<p>I value programmer ergonomics and tooling, almost above all else, and I am a happy camper.

Nowadays, .NET can also have quite a Go-like memory profile, especially if you use NativeAOT, but has much higher GC throughput which offers a more foolproof set of tradeoffs. Go has a nice specialized GC design but you cannot tune it at all, and it is centered around moderate allocation rates and consistent latency with small memory footprint. The moment you step outside its boundaries it has problematic regressions .NET&#x27;s GC implementation is robust against. Java GC implementations are even stronger, but Java also has <i>much</i> higher allocation traffic which offsets some of them.<p>Where .NET shines is by providing a performance <i>ceiling</i> completely unmatched by neither Java nor Go nor any other GC-based language. Performance ceiling in .NET sits every so slightly below Rust and C, in often an indistinguishable way. It is a very nice experience to write systems code in. It won&#x27;t give you the same safety for writing concurrent code Rust does, but it is so much more productive than dealing with C or C++, especially when it comes to portable builds and tooling. Of course, it supports only a tiny fraction of platforms compared to C. But your target is more likely to be a server or a consumer device or a comparatively beefy Raspberry PI, and .NET works really well on all of those.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42895723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cyberax</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895214">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895290">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895852">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895723">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I still prefer Go, for its first-class lightweight threads.

However, I am increasingly interested in .NET these days. I think Microsoft and the .NET community have built something truly compelling, and the language design of C# is superb (and I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s perfect by any means, but I&#x27;m routinely impressed with what they accomplish version over version.)<p>My only hangup is that I have had my confidence shaken by Microsoft&#x27;s occasional showing of hand: with the foundation drama, the debugger nonsense, and with the weird CLI live reload removal, it seems there&#x27;s still some shades of old Microsoft hanging around. I don&#x27;t honestly believe they&#x27;d pull a complete bait-and-switch, and let&#x27;s face it, Go is backed almost entirely by Google, a company that is at least as difficult to trust in the long run, but I wish they would, or perhaps <i>could</i>, do something to send a strong signal that they won&#x27;t meddle with things anymore. What they have done with open sourcing .NET is highly mutually beneficial to Microsoft, and I won&#x27;t lie that I think it was a greater service to us than them in some regards... but at the risk of sounding greedy here, I need to be able to trust that the people in charge are not going to pull any funny business if I&#x27;m going to invest my time, effort and possibly business into an ecosystem.<p>&gt; There are some - debatable - arguments that static typing reduces bugs. [...] I think the key benefit for me is what it enables in terms of reading and maintaining code. I find that static types help me understand the intent and implementation of half-remembered or unfamiliar code much more quickly.<p>But, that&#x27;s a large part of how it helps reduce bugs, in my opinion.<p>The other part is that static typing can legitimately disallow certain classes of runtime errors, but obviously that doesn&#x27;t in and of itself guarantee that code is overall less buggy. In practice, though, at least as far as reducing runtime crashes, JS with TypeScript has been night-and-day better than without. Maybe static typing itself is not actually guaranteed to reduce bugs, but in practice any system that can replace bits of &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Make Mistakes&quot; with diagnostics is going to improve reliability. The only case where I have ever questioned it was MyPy, and that&#x27;s because I feel the MyPy type system is just not powerful enough to properly cover the vast majority of idiomatic Python (or it requires too much effort.) If MyPy was more sophisticated, though, there&#x27;s just no doubt in my mind on that one.<p>All in all though I do think C# is a good choice for a productive environment to write code in. Modern .NET has a good ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks, impressive language design going on in its most popular languages, and it&#x27;s honestly pretty good in terms of performance and scalability.<p>While &quot;right tool for the right job&quot; is a <i>little</i> over-indexed on, I do think that Rust occupies a bit of a different space than C#&#x2F;.NET. Rust remains king for very high performance, minimal overhead, and safe concurrency; it&#x27;s got very few direct competitors. You certainly <i>could</i> use Rust for anything you could do in C#, but I think C# is ultimately more productive. This is not hate towards Rust, though, as I personally am the type of person that finds the value proposition of Rust very appealing and I certainly plan on investing more into Rust in the future. A better comparison for C# is Go: I think they occupy a surprisingly similar space for all of their differences. And in that realm, C# compares shockingly favorably, especially modern C# on modern .NET.</div><br/><div id="42896925" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896925" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cjblomqvist</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896189">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896925">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896925">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; My only hangup is that I have had my confidence shaken by Microsoft&#x27;s occasional showing of hand...<p>I think a really good strategy is to try to see if your goals align here. That&#x27;s where C#&#x2F;MS shines compared to many other languages supported by companies. Their interest is in you using C#, because they know that drives Azure adoption (well-known main reason why they&#x27;re spending money on .NET). MS as a company also has a very long term strategic interest in selling stuff where it&#x27;s awesome to have a ton of developers in their environment. It&#x27;s been like that forever. Say what you want about Balmer, but he was very clear on this &quot;developers, developers, developers&quot;. It&#x27;s in their core DNA. A lot of their main product lines excel due to the mass of developers around them; Office (eg SharePoint and integrations), Business Central&#x2F;ERP (integrations, plugins), Windows (ecosystem of software), Azure (including tooling such as Visual Studio, VSC). Gaming&#x2F;Search&#x2F;Live I&#x27;m less sure about, but at least for gaming C# probably helps.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42896189" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42896189" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DimmieMan</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895515">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42896925">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895623">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42896189">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42896189">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; My only hangup is that I have had my confidence shaken by Microsoft&#x27;s occasional showing of hand...<p>I&#x27;ll add to the OSS problems of poplar libraries like identity server, ImageSharp, Moq and recently Fluent Assertions having to change license due to sustainability and got absolutely raked through the coals for the audacity of doing so.

Surely they understand that explicit, external dependencies are in fact safer than internal, implicit or &quot;quiet&quot; dependencies that make it hard to pinpoint attack vectors.

And this can often be a great thing for developers, but I don&#x27;t know about a security product that&#x27;s supposed to be acting as a defense line. This is why even most obfuscation programs struggle with .NET because ultimately you can&#x27;t really obfuscate much (pass some elementary things that have been obsolete since 2009 at least).<p>.NET programs can also &quot;mutate&quot; dramatically with no hope of detection except by outside sources that are constantly checking for the integrity of known programs.

This is a bad take.  GitHub&#x27;s State of the Octoverse 2020 security report is a good read[0].  The nuget ecosystem has among the lowest package advisories, the percentage of active repos receiving Dependabot alerts, and .NET packages overall have very low numbers of direct dependencies (reducing the surface area for vulnerabilities in the supply chain).<p>A big benefit of the large first party ecosystem and broad base class library is that there are large teams of paid, professional engineers whose job is to actually track CVEs and patch vulnerabilities in .NET and C# as well as Microsoft&#x27;s first party libraries.<p>If anything, I&#x27;d say .NET&#x2F;C# are probably one of the better choices if you plan to build in a regulated or secure context because of the large first-party libraries and active monitoring and patching of CVEs by Microsoft engineers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;octoverse.github.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;octoverse.github.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;</a> (download the full PDFs)</div><br/><div id="42895470" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895470" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whoknowsidont</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895271">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895452">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895470">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895470">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;This is a bad take.<p>How is being focused on security for a security product a bad take?<p>Did you even read what I wrote or did you come to grunt?<p>EDIT: Why are you following me around between threads?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42895734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jitl</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895271">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895452">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895734">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How is c an advisable&#x2F;respectable choice for a web service &amp; cloud orchestrator system?</div><br/><div id="42895765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whoknowsidont</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895271">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895734">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895765">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you need to look at the product we&#x27;re talking about.</div><br/><div id="42895797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42895797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jitl</span><span>|</span><a href="#42895271">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42895765">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42895797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42895797">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I did, it’s a thingy that creates tasty looking cloud objects (“canaries”) in your AWS account and then monitors them for suspicious access seemingly by slurping cloudtrail logs.

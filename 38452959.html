Working at a major airline, I was the one who would pick the most difficult and risky projects. One was a quick implementation of a new payment provider for their website. That website sold millions of euros worth of tickets every day. Seconds after deployment, it turned out that I had failed to recognize the differences between the test and live environments as one of the crucial variables was blank in production. I could have expected this if I had spent more time preparing and reading documentation. Sales died completely, and my heart sank. After a lengthy rollback procedure that resulted in a few hours without sales, a massive surge of angry customers, and a loss of several million euros, I approached the CEO of the company. I still remember catching him in an elevator. I explained that this incident was all my fault and I had failed to properly analyse the environment. I assured him that I was ready to bear full consequences, including being fired. He burst into laughter and said something like this: &quot;Why would I want to get rid of you? You made a mistake that you&#x27;ll never do again. You are better at your job than you were yesterday!&quot; This experience was formative to me on many levels including true leadership. I successfully completed many high risk projects since than.</div><br/><div id="38456576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bboygravity</span><span>|</span><a href="#38456506">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456972">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456576">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You worried about that?<p>I&#x27;m a frequent flyer and I got a feeling that most airline ticket booking pages are broken in some way more than half the time.

We worked together for months to build a new version of their web service. On launch day, I was asked to do the deployment. The development and deployment process they had in place was awful and nothing like what we have today—just about every aspect of the process was manual. Anyway, everything was going well. I wrote a few scripts and SQL queries to automate the parts I could. They gave me the production credentials for when I’m ready to deploy. I decided to run what you could call my migration script one last time just to be sure I’m ready. The very moment after I hit the Enter key, I realized I had made a mistake: I had just updated the script with the production credentials just before I made the decision to do another test run. The errors started piling and their service was unresponsive. I was 100% sure I had just wiped their database and I was losing it internally. What saved me was  that one of their guys had just a couple hours earlier completed a backup of their database in anticipation of the launch; in the end, they lost a tiny bit of data but most of it was recovered via the backup. Ever since then, “careful” is an extreme understatement when it comes to how I interact with database systems—and production systems in general. Never again.</div><br/><div id="38454579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38454579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cdogl</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454289">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38454579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38454579">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your excellent story compelled me to share another:<p>We rarely interact directly with production databases as we have an event sourced architecture.

The test code respected the environment variables and connected to prod instead of docker.

I was relatively inexperienced with PHP but had the false confidence of a new grad (didn&#x27;t get a job for 6 months after graduating - so I was desperate to impress).<p>I was tasked with updating some feature flags that would turn on a new feature for all clients, except for those that explicitly wanted it off. These flags were stored in the database as integers (specifically values 4 and 5) in an array (as a string).<p>I decided to use the PHP function (array_reverse)[<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.php.net&#x2F;manual&#x2F;en&#x2F;function.array-reverse.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.php.net&#x2F;manual&#x2F;en&#x2F;function.array-reverse.php</a>] to achieve the necessary goal. However, what I didn&#x27;t know (and didn&#x27;t read up on the documentation) is that, without the 2nd argument, it only reversed the values not the keys. This corrupted the database with the exact opposite of what was needed (somehow this went through QA just fine).<p>I found out about this hours later (used to commute ~3 hrs each way) and by that time, the senior leadership was involved (small startup). It was an easy fix - just a reverse script - but it highlighted many issues (QA, DB Backups not working etc.)<p>I distinctly remember (and appreciate) that the lead architect came up to me the next day and told me that it was rite of passage of working with PHP - a mistake that he too had made early in his career.<p>I ended up being fired (grew as an engineer and was better off for it) but in that moment and weeks after it, it definitely demoralized me.</div><br/><div id="38456014" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456014" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notRobot</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455987">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454739">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456014">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456014">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They fired you for that array_reverse mistake?</div><br/><div id="38456040" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456040" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwawayosiu1</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456014">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454739">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456040">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456040">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep, I was put on PIP with impossible success criteria (no issues raised in PRs by senior engineers and no issues in code deployed to production - even if it was reviewed by senior engineers &amp; QA) and fired (for failing that criteria) in 2 weeks.<p>I worked there for ~8 months in total.</div><br/><div id="38456284" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456284" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">erhaetherth</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455987">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456040">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456171">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456284">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456284">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; no issues raised in PRs by senior engineers<p>Wat?

During my first job at a small market station 30 years ago, I was training to be a tape operator for a newscast. All the tapes for the show were in a giant stack. There were four playback VTRs. My job was to load each tape and cue it to a 1-second preroll. When a tape played and it was time to eject that tape, it was _very_ easy to lose your place and hit the eject button on the VTR that was currently being played on the air instead of the one that they just finished with. The fella who was training me did something very annoying, but it was effective: every time I went to hit the eject button, he would make a loud cautionary sound by sucking air through his closed teeth as if to tell me I was about to make a terrible mistake. I would hesitate, double check and triple check to make sure it was the right VTR, and then I would eject the tape. He made that sound every single time my finger went for the eject button. It really got on my nerves, but it was a very good way to condition me to be cautious. Our station had a policy: the first time you eject a tape on the air got you a day off without pay; the second time put you on probation; the third time was dismissal. I had several co-workers lose their jobs and wreck the newscast due to their chronic carelessness. Thanks to my annoying trainer, I learned to check, check again, and check again. I never ejected a tape on the air. It certainly would not have been a half-billion dollar mistake if I had, but at that point in my career it would have felt like it to me.</div><br/><div id="38454769" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38454769" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ksaj</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454739">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38457080">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38454769">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38454769">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That explains the old blooper reels that were popular on TV in the early 80&#x27;s, where the reporter would be talking about something, and get video of something completely bonkers in the background instead.</div><br/><div id="38455251" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38455251" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maxerickson</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454739">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454769">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38457080">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38455251">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38455251">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Rolling the wrong tape still happens frequently enough on modern live broadcasts.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38457080" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38457080" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">electrical_blu</span><span>|</span><a href="#38454739">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38455265">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38457080">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38457080">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a nice story with nice message.

Connectors with different sizes, keying, gender, etc are chosen to make this happen. This precaution is taken at design time. JPL is extremely experienced in these matters. There is probably something else left unsaid, that led to this mistake being possible.<p>Meanwhile, motor controllers using H-bridge is something that&#x27;s never boring. I once saw a motor control fail so spectacularly that we were scratching our heads for days afterwards. As always, a failure is never due to a single cause (due to careful design and redundancies). It&#x27;s a chain of seemingly innocuous events with a disastrous final outcome. But the chain was so mind-bending that we had to write it down just to remember how it happened. Recently, I was watching the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and I got reminded of this failure. Our failure was nowhere near as disastrous - but the initial mistakes, the control system instability, the human intervention and the ultimate failure propagation were very similar in nature. Needless to say, it sent us back to the drawing board for a complete redesign. The robustness of the final design taught me the same lesson - failures are something you take advantage of.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38456890" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456890" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bambax</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455236">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456890">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456890">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great write-up.

Integration is a long and complicated process. Pulling apart this bot, with however many fasteners, joints, etc, and then reassembling it correctly would be a decidedly non-trivial project that could easily take a month or two, given that testing has to be performed at each step along the way to ensure that every sensor and actuator is fully functional throughout the integration process.
This style of traditional aerospace assembly &#x2F; integration is not particularly efficient.

As a space fan, especially of the interplanetary type, this story was riveting to me as it unveiled details of the spacecraft testing I&#x27;ve never imagined. I do far less important testing in my day to day but I was able to draw some similarities with the author.<p>Many have posted of their failures here so I suppose I could share a couple of mine.<p>- Pushing gigabytes of records into a Prod table only to realize the primary key was off by a digit, rendering the data useless for a go-live. It had to be deleted by the database admins and reloaded, which took precious hours. I forget why, but an update wasn&#x27;t feasible.<p>- A perfect storm of systems issues that lead to all servers in the pool becoming unavailable, causing an entire critical system to go dark. We got it back up within minutes, but harrowing nonetheless.<p>- Realizing hours before a go-live that a key data element was missing, prompting a client who was now in a code freeze to make a change (they were quite upset). Pretty sure I got an unfavorable review from that, but haven&#x27;t made the same mistake since.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38455897" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38455897" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refactor_master</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455519">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38457073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38455897">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38455897">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From reading the developer anecdotes in here I think it’s worth mentioning that if just one person can bring down the whole enterprise, a hacker only needs a point of entry to do the same.<p>For our databases we have separate credentials, compartmentalized access and disallowed “dangerous” commands.

We worked around the clock maintaining server room and critical applications for an average size bank.<p>One of our responsibilities was to execute nightly checklists to run various processes, do backups at correct times, etc. These processes would be things like running calculations on loans, verifying results, etc.<p>We had a huge ream of checklists to accomplish this and we were supposed to follow them religiously.<p>We had two very similar applications, one our core and another a core from another bank we bought with the same application but older version and slightly different config. Consequently, we had two tracks of checklists with very similar steps.<p>One of those steps was to change the accounting date in the system. The application was a terminal app. We would telnet to the server, log in, then we would execute commands in the menu driven app. To change the date we would have to go to a special menu for super dangerous applications. It required the user to log in again.<p>Our core system, required logging in, selecting that we want to advance accounting date by one day, entering admin password again, pressing enter, then waiting for about 4 hours while the process ran. Then the process would exit back to the menu where the highlighted option would be to advance the day.<p>Our legacy system required logging in, selecting the option to advance accounting date, entering admin password, pressing enter, then waiting for two hours after which a popup showed to ask a stupid question where we would just always press enter, then wait for another hour until it exits to the menu.<p>We quickly figured out, that we can just press the enter key twice on our legacy system. The second enter press would just leave there in keyboard buffer and dismiss the popup. This was very useful for us, as this was the only operation that interrupted what would be the only time during night where we could have a kebab...<p>One night I made a mistake, and I pressed the enter twice... on the wrong system. When I figured out that I did it I realised the process would exit to the menu and then should ask for the admin password.<p>But, unfortunately, the application had a bug (or a feature). Once it exited to the menu, it came back in but for some reason it remembered that the admin password has already been entered and started advancing the accounting date again without asking for the password.<p>Unfortunately, the date was December 24. For entire December 24, the entire bank was unable to process any operations while we were restoring from last good backup (before day close) and then redoing eod operations. Then on December 25 as a penalty, I had to sit for entire day with accounting department observing how they manually entered all of the operations that would normally happen automatically on Dec 24th.<p>One extra key pressed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38455714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38455714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">donatj</span><span>|</span><a href="#38457073">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38455714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38455714">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my company people aren’t allowed to change org level GitHub settings without a second person watching over them, but NASA let a 28 year old kid run electricity into spacecraft without oversight?<p>Really seems like anything which when done improperly could cause millions of dollars in damage, there should be a second person reviewing your setup first.</div><br/><div id="38455737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38455737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stets</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455714">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38455737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38455737">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The average age of engineers running Apollo 11 was supposedly 28<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;space&#x2F;a4288&#x2F;4318625&#x2F;?utm_source=reddit.com#:~:text=%22There%27s%20a%20guy%20standing%20by%20the%20console%20with%20a%20huge%20piece%20of%20paper.%20That%27s%20me.%20I%20got%20the%20signatures%20of%20everybody%20in%20that%20room%20and%20in%20the%20back%20room.%20Every%20time%20I%20did%20that%20I%20would%20ask%20them%20their%20age.%20Well%2C%20I%20sat%20down%20and%20ran%20it%20out.%20The%20average%20age%20the%20night%20we%20had%20splashdown%20was%2028.%22" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;space&#x2F;a4288&#x2F;4318625&#x2F;?utm_so...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38453504" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38453504" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Scubabear68</span><span>|</span><a href="#38455714">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454204">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38453504">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38453504">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">With only two weeks left to go, why was a multimeter completing the telemetry circuit?</div><br/><div id="38453614" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38453614" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38453504">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38453614">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38453614">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">maybe it was measuring the current rather than the voltage as he thought, which would require putting it in series with the circuit</div><br/><div id="38453746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38453746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spfzero</span><span>|</span><a href="#38453504">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453614">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38453746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38453746">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That stood out to me as well when I read the article.</div><br/><div id="38454026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38454026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CamperBob2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38453504">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38453746">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38454269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38454026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38454026">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The multimeter in the photo has the probes plugged into the volts&#x2F;ohms jack, though.

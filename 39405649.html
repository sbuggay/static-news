I&#x27;ve lost 50lbs twice in the past decade and I&#x27;m currently losing them again. Hopefully the third time is a charm.<p>What&#x27;s different now is that I&#x27;ve done a lot of self-reflection. I now realize I have an eating disorder driven by a dopamine response to tasty foods, but unlike other people, my inner thoughts are similar to addicts, I presume, where my brain is deciding to binge the food that triggered that reward until I get stomach pains, which then nullifies the dopamine reward, so only then I stop eating. I&#x27;ve also learned the signal I get when I&#x27;ve had enough to eat and learned to not ignore it.<p>I&#x27;ve also realized that I stress eat, and particularly when I&#x27;m feeling down, probably to try to get temporary feelings of happiness as self-medication.<p>Losing weight is fairly straightforward once you get the hang of it, but keeping it off is less so. That&#x27;s the most difficult aspect to manage about my life: to try to avoid excessive stress and general periods of unhappiness, so that I don&#x27;t start using food as a source of dopamine, but since a lot of stressors are external, I feel like they&#x27;re outside of my control, so my general strategy as of late has been to replace the source of dopamine to not be food related.<p>For example, exercising not only helps with losing weight, but it also curbs my appetite so I can fast during lunch without exercising much will power. More vigorous exercise induces runner&#x27;s high, so it benefits both the efforts of losing the weight and the attempt to switch sources of feeling good.<p>Lastly getting satisfaction from shipping code is a productive replacement for the satisfaction I get from eating foods. That one is more tough to implement because eating provides immediate gratification, while shipping projects is a long endeavor usually. To counter that, I set bite-sized (ha) coding&#x2F;learning goals for myself that I can complete fairly fast. That keeps my mood up for a bit.<p>Hopefully my experience will encourage others to reflect on their own reasons for gaining weight and try to address the root cause, not just the side-effect of increased weight.</div><br/><div id="39407640" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407640" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nlitened</span><span>|</span><a href="#39406679">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39406892">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407640">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407640">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; my inner thoughts are similar to addicts<p>This has been my realization as well.

But also, if anyone is clinically overweight, in which case is it a medical issue, to rely on professionals for help.

When seen this way, there are good reasons why a person may be beholden to subconscious patterns that cause them to return to an above-average weight (and thus continue to produce hunger hormones even though they&#x27;ve eaten enough fuel for the body to function well): it can be dangerous to be in good shape - it can attract unwanted attention, attack, or expectations of capabilities that would make people see you as a threat. If a person has had some kind of trauma in the past relating to physical attack, gaining weight can be a way to become invisible, a non-threat, or better protected in the case of an attack. (FWIW this might explain cases where there are severe side-effects after taking drugs like Ozempic: the drug may be effective at blocking the hunger hormones of whatever it does, but if the subconscious pattern is still congruent with maintaining the higher weight level, it will fight back in other ways. The subconscious mind always wins, in my experience.)<p>That said, another factor can just be issues with the microbiome and digestive absorption: there are several conditions that can mean that even though a person has consumed enough food, the nutritional content is not absorbed into the body, due to the presence or colonies of organisms (bacteria, parasites, fungus) that consume the nutrients first), and&#x2F;or digestive inflammation conditions that mean the nutrients just aren&#x27;t absorbed, but the fat from the food is still stored. So, more food is desired in order to try to gain sustenance, even though it seems enough has already been consumed (though, issues relating to digestion can also originate in the subconscious mind, as the research behind YC company Mindset Health demonstrates – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindsethealth.com&#x2F;research-outcomes">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mindsethealth.com&#x2F;research-outcomes</a>)<p>Health is hard.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39407222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39407222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leshokunin</span><span>|</span><a href="#39406758">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39406542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39407222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39407222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Used to be 300lbs.

What finally worked was combining the Apple Watch (Fitbit is fine too) and a calorie counting app that track calories. The app (Yazio, there are others) took into account caloric expenditures beyond basic metabolic needs. That is, if one walks a mile as tracked by the Apple Watch, that’s an extra ~ 100 calories to eat.<p>Armed with these tools, I set a modest goal of 3-4lbs fat loss per month in Yazio. It worked. An unexpected positive outcome from this experience, is that I developed a much better intuitive sense of the caloric and nutritional value of foods and what activity levels I needed to maintain to stay at my desired weight. I recommend to give this approach a try.<p>Edit to add: These apps make an educated guess as to one’s basic metabolic daily expenditure. For reasons that aren’t clear, this estimate can vary as much as ~25% between persons. Therefore you may have to tweak the daily calorie goal. Second, weigh yourself every day. The weight loss goal of ~ 1lb&#x2F;week is less than the daily variance in body weight due to hydration levels and so forth, so you will need to use a three or four day rolling average to keep track of your progress.</div><br/><div id="39406886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39406886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coffeebeqn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39406542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39406714">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39406886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39406886">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I quickly got sick of calorie counting.

So supermarkets (are big so you can get everything, and also have the illusion of choice) stock a lot of &quot;convenient&quot; foods - typically processed and high in sugar. (Factory food is cheaper, see A)<p>D) Americans are trained young to like &quot;sweet&quot; and lots of things have lots of sugar. It starts with drinks (sodas, coffee), and then things like candy [1], bread, microwave meals, restaurants, salad dressings, and so on. If the French can be said to add butter, well Americans add sugar.<p>E) walking. Is slow, takes time, costs money. Better to drive. Which means everything is optimised for driving. Which makes it hard to walk anywhere.<p>None of this is easy to change at a cultural level. It&#x27;s literally baked into every part of society and the environment.<p>[1] chocolate is an interesting example. In Europe 75% cocoa chocolate is common, 95% sells enough that its easy to get.

Mostly plants.<p>2. Eating healthy is common sense. Don’t make it complicated.<p>3. Avoid processed foods and ingredients you don’t recognize.<p>4. Use meat for flavor, not the main course.<p>5.

If the old solution is so problematic that nothing can be salvaged from it and the best solution is a full rewrite, instead of some refactoring or modifications, then your problem is not so much that the code is solving the wrong problems. The problem is the team that built it. Every time I was ever called to rewrite a code base, there were certainly some elements that pointed to a clearer understanding of the requirements, but mostly, the necessity to do it <i>from scratch</i> pointed at a people problem.<p>Many successful projects started as reverse engineered clones of old and established ones, that then became improved versions of their predecessors. Those are rewrites, just not done by the original project&#x27;s team.<p>My opinionated rules of full rewrites, informed by experience and observation:<p>1- Bring in <i>one</i>, just one, project lead who is a specialist of the technical domain. E.g. if you&#x27;re building a web app, hire a seasoned web developer, instead of relying on your in-house electrical engineer, whom you allowed to architect the previous solution, because they managed to convince you that code is code.<p>2- Let the new lead vet every member of the old team, including (especially) the old team leaders.<p>3- Allow the new lead to drop any dead wood.</div><br/><div id="37631296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37631296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rewmie</span><span>|</span><a href="#37631096">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631173">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37630956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37631296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37631296">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If the old solution is so problematic that nothing can be salvaged from it and the best solution is a full rewrite, instead of some refactoring or modifications, then your problem is not so much that the code is solving the wrong problems. The problem is the team that built it.<p>I think you&#x27;re too quick to point fingers and too desperate to throw people under the bus to pass yourself as saviour.<p>There are plenty of everyday scenarios where software piles up technical debt in spite of the developers. All it takes is a single requirement to change for an entire tech stack to become a problem instead of problem-solver, and all it takes is a business goal to be met at record time to pile up quick-and-dirty solutions instead of well-architected implementations. These happen far more often than replacing whole teams, and new project leads solve nothing.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on a legacy project which started as a multi-platform desktop app that in the meantime became Windows-only. You can imagine the cruft that resulted from this requirements change alone. During the same period, business requirements changed to support new major features, and Microsoft started pushing for Windows 11. Of course we discussed a major rewrite, as the legacy tech stack didn&#x27;t supported native Windows features well and the legacy application was riddled with multi-platform code that made no sense anymore. Switching to vanilla WPF alone would eliminate 90% of the project&#x27;s pain points.<p>Tell me exactly how the team created this problem, and how you would be the key to fix it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37630956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37630956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mekoka</span><span>|</span><a href="#37631096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631300">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37630956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37630956">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Obviously satire, but in real life, there are reasons why a full rewrite becomes appealing. <i>Perhaps</i> the solution even.<p>One is overwhelming technical debt.

Joel Spolsky wrote about that a long time ago as did others; most software that’s older has millions of badly documented changes applied by 1000s of people over the decades and rewriting tends to take literally forever (never finishes) or at least much long than anyone estimated times PI. And then the endresult is usually just as crappy but with more bugs.<p>The Dutch tax software rewrite attempts are an example I am personally familiar with. These attempt made me create a services company to help companies keep legacy software running forever. We support gnarly stuff over 25 years old and still wouldn’t recommend a rewrite for the above reasons.<p>There are of course cases where rewrites (of significance; rewriting a 50k LoC codebase is not going to be hard) work, but usually the rewrite is done by the same people that did the original , the original wasn’t actually that bad but just too hard to extend in modern times etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37631015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37631015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BlargMcLarg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631257">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631300">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37631015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37631015">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Code where the project manager didn&#x27;t believe in encapsulation, or refactoring, or none of that &quot;architectural nonsense&quot;<p>If anything I find the largest proponents to have drunk too deep from that well and cause the rewrites to never be considered, as the time required to do it becomes far too long to be worth the pay-out.<p>This excludes the worst kind: the overarchitectured old mess in need of a rewrite as it was based on the wrong assumptions and is now boggled down by 10 layers of abstractions and indirection which don&#x27;t do anything.</div><br/><div id="37631312" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37631312" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BigJono</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630956">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631015">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631300">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37631312">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37631312">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It depends on the level of the architecture.

The goal was to rewrite a C++ application from the 90s in Java, since the company had largely moved to the web and C++ devs were getting close to retirement. The C++ application was also written in the underfunded startup phase, and then over decades new features had been &quot;tagged on&quot;, so the architecture wasn&#x27;t that robust.<p>The team tasked with the rewrite set a goal to finish in a year, the first 4-6 months were entirely spent on planning. After that, features were implemented in a modular and iterative approach. I think overall it took a bit longer than a year to be feature complete, but by the end of the year they had a working platform with all the core features implemented.<p>I think the key here really was very good planning, and the pitfalls you describe can be at least partially ascribed to agile development not being the right tool if you have a very clear and large set of requirements.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37630957" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37630957" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loveparade</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630669">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37630775">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37630921">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37630957">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37630957">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see this story here all the time, but I have never seen it play out in the real world.

Like Lucy and the football, if you&#x27;re sure that this rewrite is different, you need to consider how that&#x27;ll happen.<p>If you build in parallel, you need to decide what work will go into the existing system and how long the new system will take. Do you pause new features? If yes, I guarantee you that&#x27;ll be an issue. I also guarantee it&#x27;ll take longer than you think it will. If you don&#x27;t pause new features, you&#x27;ll be chasing moving goal posts so it&#x27;ll take even longer. All of this is significant extra effort that you have to hope to recoup somehow with the new system.<p>Remember that it won&#x27;t take that long before your new system is also considered legacy.<p>Once you have that new system, how do you deploy it? Dropping it in place is generally a high-risk strategy that&#x27;ll greatly slow your migration.<p>Instead of the above, what you generally want is to do partial rewrites in-place using infrastructure you may need to build but you&#x27;ll want anywhere. Here is the progression of, for example, a backend migration:<p>1. Double-write to the old and new backends. The new system is just a dummy, eseentially. You won&#x27;t be using it (yet). Do offline verification on the old and new backends. Look at metrics for double-writes vs single-writes (eg latency, general performance, crashes);<p>2. Start reading from the old and new backends. Do a comparison of the data retrieved from both. Log and flag any instances where the data differs. You&#x27;ve now verified the new backend;<p>3. Start reading from the new backend;<p>4. Stop writing to the old backend.<p>This requires things like a robust experiment framework so you can, for example, double-write for 1% of your users and then compare the two groups easily across a wide range of metrics to see if there is any unexpected regression.<p>The point of all this is you can do partial rollouts of any of these steps and, more importantly, a rollback is trivial.</div><br/><div id="37631249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37631249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marginalia_nu</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630853">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37631190">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37631249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37631249">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; what you generally want is to do partial rewrites in-place using infrastructure you may need to build but you&#x27;ll want anywhere.<p>Worked in a place where they were embarking on their third generation of failed incremental replacement of a system originally built in COBOL.

Youngsters believe rewrites are for old people who didn’t get their code right.<p>Business apps only last for 15 years max. Every app requires a rewrite after 10 years, apps that don’t do it weren’t actually important for business.<p>Software stacks are flimsy. Apps need to support NPM, then Kubernetes. There are new security discoveries and way to prevent them. How do you list your libraries if you are not using NPM? Also we need to move the app to the cloud because installed software is not fashionable. The original software may be reasonable, but assumptions and expectations change.<p>Why don’t we see them more often, then?<p>The response is: Because they are worded as “Brand new app from scratch” in job descriptions, and because NPM hasn’t finished its 10-year cycle yet. But rewrites they will come, and you better be have a methodology for that.<p>When you build an app, one day, a requirement will be to make apps easily rewritable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37630764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37630764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dieselgate</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630851">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37630764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37630764">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m honestly not sure if this is satire or not given the subdomain.<p>And definitely didn’t like the “People who don’t work on software… …are stupid.” - can’t stand that kind of chit if it’s not satire.<p>But guess to piggy back on other comments my experience with full V2 rewrites is - get laid off because the project gets canceled.<p>The things mentioned in the article can be also useful when migrating&#x2F;upgrading large features within projects, which may be more common, but is kind of self evident imo<p>Edit: clause</div><br/><div id="37630906" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37630906" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jabrov</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630764">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37630906">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37630906">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s obviously satire, and if you read the article for &quot;people ... are stupid&quot; you will see that is also satire</div><br/><div id="37631050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37631050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37630764">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37630906">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37631050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37631050">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Even the subtitle &quot;Fix the system, not your understanding&quot; should be fair warning already.<p>On a different note, I wonder what it does to the reliability of AI models when they are trained on vast portions of the internet that include satire and April, 1st articles.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

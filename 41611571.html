My view, there isn&#x27;t much.  The schools of math, engineering, and business have given optimization a big push, back at least to Dantzig, but from my long experience the interest was and is still just too low for &quot;applied&quot; optimization to have much in applications.<p>Cases:  Sure, there has been a professor at Princeton who applied optimization to oil refining:  What mixture of crude oil to mix into the refinery and what mixture of refined products to take out.  Maybe a few, large livestock operations actually do run some <i>diet problem</i> solutions.  And can use 0-1 optimization for Sudoku problems?  What path for picking orders in a big warehouse, for Amazon or Walmart?  A simple traveling salesman problem, and for a good enough solution build a minimum spanning tree and walk around that -- maybe they are doing that already.  Assembly line balancing:  Assign workers to positions to maximize the speed of the slowest worker assignment.  Is anyone actually doing that?  Even if they are, the solution is quite simple.  Yes, a start on P vs NP was at Bell Labs designing networks.  So, maybe with the Internet there are still valuable applications?  Considered that.  Got an interview at a company trying that. They were impressed by what I&#x27;d done at FedEx, but they were nearly dead and, I suspect, soon died.  Maybe with big logistics, ocean, rail, trucks, warehouses, there are some big logistics problems where optimization could save a lot -- applications enough for careers?  Better than grass mowing?  When I got my Ph.D., the Chair of my dissertation orals committee was a big name in logistics -- saw no evidence
of significant interest in applications.  No ones in the halls.  Phone not ringing.  No suggestions of contacts for me.<p>Look, when there is a big need, ESPECIALLY when there is big money involved, it soon gets obvious, and the US economy gets to it right away.  In that, &quot;applied&quot; optimization is not hot, warm, or much above freezing.<p>Right, you are mentioning <i>formulation</i>:<p>(1) They had already formulated a 0-1 optimization problem.  It had 40,000 constraints and 600,000 variables.  They had tried the then popular <i>simulated annealing</i>, ran for days, and quit.  So, the <i>formulation</i> was done and not mine.<p>I worked hard, with the IBM OSL (optimization subroutine library), did 900 primal-dual iterations, Lagrangian relaxation, got a feasible solution within 0.025% of optimality, within two weeks, for free, a <i>free sample</i>, and never heard from them again.  They resented  and were afraid of my success.<p>(2) Another company was working a little more generally in optimization.  Had a crude heuristic running.  On some of their problems, 0-1, linear, again was successful with the OSL, and got only insults and resentment.  Continued on, gave them a nice formulation, better than their heuristic, and path through optimization, and got fired.  They&#x27;d hired me and wanted to fire me before 6 months was up.  They were not very good with linear programming at all, and I was a LOT better at what they were doing in the formulation, math, and computing, and their reaction was they didn&#x27;t want me for competition.<p>(3) In a military group, did well with some non-linear optimization (their formulation).  Then they had a challenging <i>strategic</i> problem.  I did a formulation of a Monte-Carlo solution and wrote and ran the code (used an Oak Ridge random number generator I&#x27;d programmed in assembler).  They called in a famous probability professor for a review.  His remark was that there was no way the Monte-Carlo could &quot;fathom&quot; the <i>tree</i>.  He was right; the tree was huge.  But each trial of my Monte-Carlo yielded at each point in time a random variable on 0-15, and the law of large numbers applied right away.  It wasn&#x27;t D-day, but suppose it was:  The <i>tree</i> of possibilities was enormous, but the, say, number of Allied soldiers killed was, what, 0-200,000.  So, each trial give a random variable value at, say, each second, for, say, 48 hours -- the law of large numbers applies and could tell Ike the distribution of number of deaths, the expected values, the median, the variance for each second of the 48 hours.  Passed the review.  One guy there used my random number generator on one of his old problems, got significantly different results, was afraid, said &quot;I don&#x27;t want you in the center of all my projects&quot;, and I got ignored on the way to being fired.<p>(4) At FedEx, had written a program that showed the BOD that the program made the fleet scheduling easy enough and saved the company.  So, to do better, formulated a <i>set covering</i> direction.  Savings?  1% would have been $millions a year.  The founder, COB, CEO wrote a memo making that my project, but my boss, a Senior VP, said that there was no money in the budget for me; I&#x27;d been commuting between Memphis and Maryland where my wife was in her Ph.D. program; the stock promised in three weeks was very late; and I went for a Ph.D.<p>Actually another student at another school ran with my set covering formulation for his dissertation.<p>The high level, overview, simple fact of life, is as I described:  There just is no real career in &quot;applied&quot; optimization.  That horse is nearly dead and should not be further flogged.  Millions of US families have a house, stable marriage, and healthy children, and I&#x27;d believe that fewer than 20 of those families are supported by careers in &quot;applied&quot; optimization -- maybe 0 families.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41614205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whiterknight</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613980">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614693">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614313">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614205">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’re attributing these life challenges to your STEM PhD speciality?<p>I am sensitive to your hardship, but optimization has nothing to do with it.

At the time the math was a small aid.<p>Did get paid for some work in applied optimization on some military problems.  Looking back, there was some stranger in the office eager to discuss the weather, etc. with me.  Maybe I said the wrong things about some of the US foreign wars, and then the stranger was gone.  Might have been some high end military job interview that needed only gung ho attitudes toward foreign policy.<p>Delicate political situation, and I was oblivious about politics.  Like, &quot;stick to two subjects, the weather and everyone&#x27;s health&quot; and avoid &quot;sex, politics, and religion&quot;.<p>Early on while I was in a grad program teaching math, some recruiters came from DC desperate for anyone with some math&#x2F;physics education.  I interviewed:  Got a offer and took a job right away.  Soon bought a new car and got married.<p>In those days, around DC, to get a job, just look in the <i>WaPo</i>, apply, go on the interview, show some knowledge of some of computing, get an offer, compare a few offers, with, say, a 15% raise, and accept one -- worked great. For a while, at GE time sharing national HQ, was the main guy for the applied math library, e.g., the FFT, regression analysis.

For some years, the career was computing but with some math, e.g., the FFT (fast Fourier transform), ....<p>I never wanted the Ph.D., what I learned there, the research I did there, to be the basis of a career.  Instead, before the Ph.D. I had a good career going with computing and, at times a crucial help, some math, and went for the Ph.D. ONLY to do better at THAT career.  For my career, the day I entered the Ph.D. program was a BIG step down, and what I&#x27;d learned about optimization was, in a word, WORTHLESS.<p>My main point here is on the word &quot;applied&quot; for optimization:  I was well qualified, and happened to publish some research in <i>optimization</i>, but discovered that &quot;applied&quot; optimization was not the basis of a good career.  Here I&#x27;m just reporting that fact.  I doubt that there is still any real career opportunity in &quot;applied&quot; optimization.<p>So, a book title with &quot;Applied&quot; Optimization is to me a outrage.<p>I wasn&#x27;t stuck on &quot;optimization&quot;.  For a while worked in the first wave of AI (artificial intelligence via the Rete algorithm).  Then published in mathematical statistics.  I was perfectly willing to mow grass, shine shoes, ..., do anything that would support me financially, be reasonably safe, and not seriously illegal but discovered that &quot;Ph.D.&quot;
on the resume blocked any such.  Thought about taking &quot;Ph.D.&quot; off the resume but was afraid that I&#x27;d get into trouble due to the gap in time.<p>Here my point, complaint, warning, contribution to others, is:  My long experience was that there is nearly no career in &quot;applied&quot; optimization. A second point could be, outside of academics, a Ph.D. can hurt your career.  Try leaving it off your resume.  A Ph.D. might be worse for your career than a felony conviction; no joke (my legal history is totally clean).<p>In life, we are forced to make important decisions without good information.  In my career, at times I did well, and at times I didn&#x27;t.<p>E.g., by middle school it seemed accepted and true that education helps, more education helps more, education in the STEM fields is the best, a Ph.D. is the best education, and, thus, a Ph.D. in a STEM field should be really good, e.g., easily enough to buy a house and support a family.<p>Truth:  Nope, too simple.  I couldn&#x27;t take care of my wife, kitty cats, get a job, any job, at all, ANY job, got run out of the house by the Sheriff with guns.<p>With a BS &quot;With Honors&quot; in math, I got strongly recruited.  With a Ph.D. in applied math, including optimization, I got strongly rejected.<p>Yup, it hurt.  I was manipulated, lied to, and hurt.<p>&quot;psychological burden&quot;:  Maybe those are the right words.  But millions of people have suffered worse, e.g., The Great Depression, wars, Covid in the family, and much more, and still did well.<p>Don&#x27;t know the solution in general.<p>For me, now, still good in math and computing, with .NET, etc. got a Web site, with some math at the core, running easily enough, and intending to go live, get some viewers, run simple ads (standard sized rectangles), and make some money.  In this, want to remain anonymous and not be a <i>public person</i>.<p>And want to OWN the business.  Have someone list what papers I need to file for a business, an LLC, etc.  Get an accountant.  Get and receive revenue.  In simple terms, add up the expenses and keep the rest.  Eventually sell the business and pursue, say, mathematical physics.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41614376" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614376" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">richrichie</span><span>|</span><a href="#41613980">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614704">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41614313">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614376">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614376">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You should have tried wall street.

I&#x27;d just published a paper in anomaly detection in complex systems, gave a talk at the main NASDAQ server farm, and later at Morgan Stanley.  No real interest.<p>Sent a copy of my anomaly paper to a hedge fund, got an interview, was asked by one of their junior people &quot;If know the correlation between A and B and that between B and C, what about A and C&quot;?  Okay, maybe: Start with the cosine of the sum of two angles???<p>Asked them for a reference on investing math -- did already know about the old Markowitz work, the <i>efficient frontier</i>, the role of quadratic optimization, about to do more with stochastic differential equations for the Black-Scholes work -- got the book they mentioned, saw that its math was all junk, and didn&#x27;t follow up with the A and C contact, a mistake.<p>Did send a resume to Simons.<p>Looked into deterministic optimal control, Athens and Falb, talked with Athens, later talked with an Athens student who knew something about Simons and claimed that he hired mostly Russian mathematicians.  So gave up.  A mistake.  I was naive.<p>Later, of course, Simons explained that he liked people who, say, via math but any math, had shown some ability, and I had some evidence I could have shown.  My Math SAT was high enough that maybe I even beat Simons?<p>I was naive:  Assumed that a carefully written resume was necessary and sufficient and that anything else was superfluous and unwelcome.<p>Nope:  In practice in the real world, keep trying different things.  Do send reprints of published papers.  E.g., when I was at Georgetown, computer center staff and teaching computer science, a prof had some teaching software as a <i>front end</i> to the IBM SSP (scientific subroutine package) and in testing found that two of the IBM routines were too slow and the third had poor numerical accuracy.  So, I wrote <i>plug compatible</i> versions -- used some (n)ln(n) software and some tricky double use of memory to replace the n^2 software and used some Forsythe and Moler work to fix the accuracy problem -- seemed too simple to me, but COULD have sent Simons that work.  Once did get a lecture on differential geometry from a student of A. Gleason and had a copy of some S. Chern notes -- could have studied those and sent something to Simons.  How&#x27;d I know Simons knew Chern??<p>There is a recent remark:  &quot;Don&#x27;t give up.  Keep plugging&quot;.<p>I was naive.  Knew much more about math and computing than people and personality.<p>Since WWII, the US military has pushed hard to have more -- students, professors, and research -- in math and science.  In high school, taught myself the math, learned the physics at a glance, otherwise goofed off (had a girlfriend drop dead gorgeous), but did well on the state standardized tests, so got sent to summer math&#x2F;physics <i>enrichment</i> programs.  I swallowed the bait hook, line, and sinker.  I&#x27;d recommend:<p>&quot;Always look for the hidden agenda.&quot;<p>&quot;Believe none of what you hear, half of what you see, still that will be twice too much.&quot;<p>&quot;Who you know can be more important than what you know.&quot;<p>There were some opportunities to &quot;know&quot; some powerful people, but I was naive.<p>My Ph.D. advisor was a nice guy, but I got to him after the fallout of a bad civil war in the faculty and never much talked with him.  For my dissertation, some applied math, and had the main idea on an airplane flight before the Ph.D. program, in the first year wrote a 50 page first draft, later cleaned up the math, used Fubini&#x27;s theorem in a short proof that my math was optimal, wrote some illustrative software, typed in the paper, showed it to my advisor and the rest of the department, had a famous guy a Chair of an orals committee to review the dissertation, and graduated.  My advisor and one of the faculty (connected in DC and later President at an Ivy) knew a LOT about politics, but I was naive.<p>For a while, my career, in computing but with some math on the side, e.g., the FFT and digital filtering of Navy sonar signals, was going well, so I got the Ph.D. in applied math just to do better in THAT career and with ZERO intentions to be a professor or do academic research.

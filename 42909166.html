I&#x27;ve hired something like 150 developers so far, and what I ended up with after a few years of trial and error:<p>1. Use recruiters and network: Wading through the sheer volume of applications was even nasty before COVID, I don&#x27;t even want to imagine what it&#x27;s like now. A good recruiter or a recommendation can save a lot of time.<p>2. Do either no take home test, or one that takes at most two hours. I do discuss the solution candidates came up with, so as long as they can demonstrate they know what they did there, I don&#x27;t care too much how they did it. If I do this part, it&#x27;s just to establish some base line competency.<p>3. Put the candidate at ease - nervous people don&#x27;t interview well, another problem with non-trivial tasks in technical interviews. I rarely do any live coding, if I do, it&#x27;s pairing and for management roles, to e.g. probe how they manage disagreement and such. But for developers, they mostly shine when not under pressure, I try to see that side of them.<p>4. Talk through past and current challenges, technical and otherwise. This is by far the most powerful part of the interview IMHO. Had a bad manager? Cool, what did you do about it? I&#x27;m not looking for them having resolved whatever issue we talk about, I&#x27;m trying to understand who they are and how they&#x27;d fit into the team.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this process for almost a decade now, and currently don&#x27;t think I need to change anything about it with respect to LLMs.<p>I kinda wish it was more merit based, but I haven&#x27;t found a way to do that well yet. Maybe it&#x27;s me, or maybe it&#x27;s just not feasible. The work I tend to be involved in seems way too multi faceted to have a single standard test that will seriously predict how well a candidate will do on the job. My workaround is to rely on intuition for the most part.</div><br/><div id="42916115" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42916115" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Stratoscope</span><span>|</span><a href="#42915848">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42916226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42916115">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42916115">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When I was interviewing candidates at IBM, I came up with a process I was really happy with. It started with a coding challenge involving several public APIs, in fact the same coding challenge that was given to me when I interviewed there.<p>What I added:<p>1. Instead of asking &quot;do you have any questions for me?&quot; at the very end, we started with that general discussion.<p>2. A few days ahead, I emailed the candidate the problem and said they are welcome to do it as a take home problem or we could work on it together. I let them know that if they did it ahead of time, we would do a code review and I would ask them about their design and coding choices. Or if they wanted to work on it together, they should consider it a pair programming session where I would be happy to work with them and advise them just as I would with any colleague. Not some adversarial thing!<p>3. This the innovation I am proud of: a segment at the beginning of the interview called &quot;teach me something&quot;. In my email I encouraged the candidate to teach me something unrelated to our work, or programming related if they preferred that. Candidates taught me things like these:<p>• How to choose colors of paint to mix that will get the shade you want.<p>• How someone who is bilingual thinks about different topics in their different languages.<p>• How the paper bill handler in an ATM works.<p>• How to cook pork belly in an air fryer without the skin flying off (the trick is punching holes in the skin with toothpicks).<p>I listed these in my email as examples of fun topics to teach me about. And I mentioned that if I were asked this question, I might talk about how to tune a harmonica, and why a harmonica player would want to do that<p>This was fun for me and the candidate. It helped put them at ease by letting them shine as the expert in some area they had a special interest in.</div><br/><div id="42916211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42916211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asalahli</span><span>|</span><a href="#42915848">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42916115">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42916226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42916211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42916211">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Love the 3rd point!

I don&#x27;t necessarily think it is about knowing the edge cases, but rather it is about knowing how to describe the problem and your solution.

But a lot of what I gauge for is a blend of not just technical capability, but the ability to translate that into prudent decisions with product instincts around business outcomes. AI is getting better at solving technical problems it&#x27;s seen before in a black box, but it struggles to tailor that to any kind of context you give it to pre-existing constraints around user behavior, existing infrastructure&#x2F;architecture, business domain and resource constraints.<p>To be fair, many humans do too, but many promising candidates even at the mid-level band of experience who thrive at organizations I&#x27;ve approved them into are able to eventually get to a good enough balance of many tradeoffs (technical and otherwise) with a pretty clean and compact amount of back and forth that demonstrates thoughtfulness, curiosity and efficacy.<p>If someone can get to that level of capability in a technical interviewing process using AI without it being noticeable, I&#x27;d be really excited about the world. I&#x27;m not holding my breath for that, though (and having done LOTS of interviews over the past few quarters, it would be a great problem to have).<p>My solution, if I were to have the luxury of having that problem, would be a pretty blunt instrument -- I&#x27;d instead change my process to actually have AI use of tools be part of the interviewing process -- I&#x27;d give them a problem to solve, a tuned in-house AI to use in solving the problem, and have their ability to prompt it well, integrate its results, and pressure check its assumptions (and correct its mistakes or artifacts) be part of the interview itself. I&#x27;d press to see how creatively they used the tool -- did they figure out a clever way to use it for leverage that I wouldn&#x27;t have considered before? Extra points for that. Can they use it fluidly and in the heat of a back and forth of an architectural or prototyping session as an extension of how they problem solve? That will likely become a material precondition of being a senior engineer in the future.<p>I think we&#x27;re still a few quarters (to a few years) away from that, but it will be an exciting place to get to. But ultimately, whether they&#x27;re using a tool or not, it&#x27;s an augment to how they solve problems and not a replacement. If it ever gets to be the latter, I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much -- you probably won&#x27;t need to do much hiring because then you&#x27;ll truly be able to use agentic AI to pre-empt the need for it! But something tells me that day (which people keep telling me will come) will never actually come, and we will always need good engineers as thought partners, and instead it will just raise the bar and differentiation between truly excellent engineers and middle of the pack ones.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42911739" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42911739" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbarnett</span><span>|</span><a href="#42910568">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42911570">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42913229">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42911831">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42911739">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42911739">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is called fraud, and it is a crime.<p>People don&#x27;t really call the police, nor sue over this.

  - Implement a small but impactful proof of concept (PoC).
  - Demonstrate coding craftsmanship through clean, well-architected code.
</code></pre>
We estimate this project will take approximately 5–7 hours. If you find that it requires more time, let us know so we can adjust the scope.<p>Feel free to use any tools, libraries, frameworks, or LLMs during this exercise. Also, you’re welcome to reach out to us at any time with questions or for clarification.<p>&lt;&#x2F;instructions&gt;<p>I used LLM-as-a-junior-dev to generate 95+% of the code and documentation.

side of the table, I&#x27;d hire anyone who demonstrated the quality of output submitted.<p><pre><code>  - The 5-7 hour estimate was exceeded (however, I was the first one through this exercise). 
  - IMHO the quality of the submission could NOT have been met in lesser time.
  - They had 3 tasks&#x2F;projects:
     - a data science project, 
     - a CLI based project and
     - a web app
  - They wanted each to be done in a different language. 
  - I submitted my solution &lt;38 hours of receipt of the assignment. 
  - In any other world, the intensity of this exercise would cause a panic-attack&#x2F;burn-out. 
  - I slept well (2 nights of sleep), took care of family responsibilities and felt good enough to attack the next work-day.

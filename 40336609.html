The answer is that Steve Jobs knew how to sell luxury items to people who identified themselves with the quality of their work, whether they were accomplished creative professionals or cube-dwelling (now coworking) &quot;knowledge workers&quot; or MBAs who take sommelier classes or aspiring writers grinding on their novels at Starbucks. It was partly about the experience of using an Apple product, but it was just as much, if not more, about vicariously identifying with the standards of craftsmanship. If it was only about the experience, and the craftsmanship was a means to the experience, then the backs of the cabinets would not have mattered. They mattered because the craftsmanship was not just a means but was fetishized for its own sake.</div><br/><div id="40337811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40337811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gofreddygo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40337447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40337823">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40337811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40337811">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Article is spot about its topic - tradeoffs.

I <i>wish</i> my Ikea furniture used plywood. Instead, you get fiberboard.<p>It&#x27;s also a good example of how the metaphor this blog post is predicated on can fall apart. Your customers care about durability, but they make purchasing decisions based on cost and outward appearance. In a world like that, where you can&#x27;t satisfy all requirements at once, you inevitably end up cutting corners on the things the customer cares about but can&#x27;t measure. But is that right? That&#x27;s how you end up with $200 furniture that lasts a year or two in a home with children or pets.<p>It&#x27;s also easy to neglect cumulative costs. Back to software: does it matter if your app uses 100 MB of memory when it could be using 1 MB? On an individual basis, no, because RAM is cheap. Cumulatively, when every other app developer thinks the same, and when you multiply it by billions of devices, your decision might have actually cost lives if you consider the increased emissions and countless other distant externalities.<p>A milder version of the blog&#x27;s claim is definitely true.

But if it make sense, you do so. You also need someones that understand each core deps enough they can patch it if the maintainers won&#x27;t resolve an issue (happens more in the npm world). Even with React, you can extract the business logic and reuse it elsewhere. The goal is to avoid depending that much on projects that have less stability than yours (some bad experiences here with React Native). How you do it is contextual, but you should keep it in mind.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40337567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40337567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yakkomajuri</span><span>|</span><a href="#40337654">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40338629">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40337567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40337567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a lot of organizations I feel like #2 is often the difficulty.

They each have their own budget and preferences that you can work with to get them something they want to buy. The incentives and constraints are clear here. If you can make something the client wants at a price and quality point they can afford you will do well.<p>Many (most?) software developers create a product to satisfy the needs of many customers and non-customers simultaneously. Furthermore you almost never interact directly with customers; instead developers interact with a panoply of different business interests such as engineering managers, product managers, project manager, product owners, etc. Even worse software doesn&#x27;t have to be done to ship it as it can always be fixed &quot;later&quot;. With the advent of Agile, Scrum, and SAFe it&#x27;s clear what the business wants is not someone good at a craft; they want an assembly line.<p>So what are the incentive structures and constraints here? Every other person has incentives for career advancement, bonuses, raises, etc. Most people are too far removed from customers to be directly affected by them. How many times has a cabinet maker been told that the hope chest they&#x27;re working on for one client also needs to double as a bank vault. Oh and by the way it needs to be done by the end of the quarter (right after layoffs of course) because they are hoping to be bought out. Code bases end up being a fractured mess of bad abstractions, infinite abstractions, and rewrites because developers are trying to accommodate the impossible demands set forth by the business in a way that doesn&#x27;t cause their job to be abject misery.<p>TLDR: most software developers are not expected to be craftsmen (or women). The company determines, through incentives and constraints, the quality of code it will produce. An individual software developer risks burnout if they think quality above and beyond what the company allows is within their responsibilities or capabilities.</div><br/><div id="40337686" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40337686" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skydhash</span><span>|</span><a href="#40337557">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40337454">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40337686">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40337686">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What I&#x27;ve seen mostly is developers bringing complexity, then cutting corners after that because they don&#x27;t want to deal with it.

Spend some time to revisit the code architecture to see if it still fits the problem you&#x27;re solving. Instead of spending three cycles on something that could have been done in one because of how fragile everything is.

It&#x27;s a sound advice if you care about technical debt as an engineer.<p>My point is that very often it&#x27;s not up to engineers. If a company doesn&#x27;t incentivize this refactoring and engineers have to - as some sibling comments suggest - inflate their estimates then the code base will deteriorate over time. Even if your team sets up a policy of doing refactoring ~15% of the time this will be overridden by business interests more often than not.<p>This is essentially a corollary of Conway&#x27;s Law. You should not expect code bases to be better than the business incentivizes it to be. I&#x27;m speaking from personal experience here; this is burnout territory. Keep in mind these are very general observations and every company is different. In some companies what you and Crockford suggest is possible. I&#x27;d wager it&#x27;s the exception rather than the rule though.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40337454" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40337454" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">renewiltord</span><span>|</span><a href="#40337557">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40337270">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40337454">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40337454">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">âAny fool can build a bridge that stands.

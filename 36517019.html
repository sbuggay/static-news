Differences in representation ie. multiple perspectives, help people to develop their understanding of the underlying concepts of the system.<p>This is important because code doesn&#x27;t effectively record concepts, intents and oughts. These are things recorded within the context of the system. So the more context, usage and interactions available, the more opportunity for learning.<p>I think consistency is one of those things that sounds appealing and offers the illusion of making development &#x27;easier&#x27; but boils down to someone deciding by fiat that their poorly communicated representation of the system is correct and nobody else should add their own representations of the system to build up a useful level of context and understanding.</div><br/><div id="36520376" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36520376" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Timon3</span><span>|</span><a href="#36519994">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36523904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36520376">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36520376">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hard disagree. Inconsistency increases the amount of time needed for any feature and increases the likelihood of bugs. There is no upside in having to understand each individual piece of functionality from the ground up, because a lot of functionality is simply repeated in slightly different ways.

The woodshop looks sloppy, half-assed and almost sure to be an inefficient place to do work, if it does not get cleaned up on a regular basis.<p>Because they cannot see deadcode in the repository in a similar manner, it is especially challenging to get them to care.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I&#x27;ve messed around on Mastodon instances, but it never really clicked with me. I never really used Twitter though, either, so not surprised. I did enjoy old Instagram around the time stories came out because it was just my friends sharing less-polished pictures of what they were doing, so I thought maybe I would enjoy Pixelfed. I played with Scuttlebutt for a while and found it the most fun, just a pain in the ass to use.<p>However, they all have a similar problem. There&#x27;s almost no one except bored tech people on them. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think retro computing is cool, and I like seeing people&#x27;s DIY hardware creations occasionally, but it&#x27;s only a small niche. The corner shop is boring if it&#x27;s almost always empty, and the only people that ever show up are other corner shop proprietors or corner shop enthusiasts. At the same time I&#x27;m aware that attracting the rhetorical racist uncle from Facebook over to your Mastodon instance is not the goal, and it wouldn&#x27;t make it better to have wider appeal.<p>There are very few non-tech-specific old web holdouts that I know of. One of my favorites is Crazy Guy on a Bike [1]. It&#x27;s a special purpose site, forum, blogging platform, etc. specifically for bike touring, all run on donations by one crazy guy writing Perl like it&#x27;s 1998. It&#x27;s been around for over 20 years, and as cool as it is, it&#x27;s also fixed scene that isn&#x27;t growing or attracting new members. As people move on and donations dry up I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll disappear.<p>I don&#x27;t want it to be so, but I feel like whether you&#x27;re at the mall or the corner store, the internet is just a boring place now, and yet I spend more time with it than almost anything else. Probably says more about my age and the fact that AIM chat and quirky HTML sites were a part of my childhood than anything else.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crazyguyonabike.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crazyguyonabike.com&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="39559441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39559441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RamblingCTO</span><span>|</span><a href="#39559299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39559844">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39559441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39559441">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I also liked instagram back in the day for photography.

Specialized shops put more thought into their product selection than &quot;anything I can dropship&quot; and compared to modern Amazon it&#x27;s far easier to find something resembling quality. They may be more expensive but in my experience paying 70 bucks once to a trustworthy vendor ends far better than paying $20-30 three times on Amazon because in reality it&#x27;s always the same $5 Aliexpress stuff. The downside is that small shops sometimes have a bit more friction in the ordering process or higher delivery costs.<p>About a year ago I didn&#x27;t even have a choice: dozens of USB-C adapters I looked at on Amazon were obviously lying about the specs in their product description, I couldn&#x27;t find a single one that was even worth trying. They all just go for the lowest common denominator and hope 99% of the customers don&#x27;t actually check (and are probably right, sadly). A local shop meanwhile had exactly one adapter of that kind with datasheets on the manufacturer&#x27;s website and it worked.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39559311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39559311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">verisimi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39559548">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39559311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39559311">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The wider internet is pretty dead to me - is it much more than a bunch of corporate shop fronts?

The bar he set is so broad and ambiguous, that probably anything Waymo did, would not qualify as self driving to him. So he think humans are intervening once every 1-2 miles to train the Waymo, we’re not even sure if that is true, I heard from friends that it was 100+ miles but let us say Waymo comes out and says it is 1000 miles.<p>Then I bet Rodney can just fiddle with goal post and say that 3.26 trillion miles were driven in US in 2024, and having a human intervene 1000 miles would mean 3.26 billion interventions, and that this is clearly not self driving. In fact until Waymo disables Internet on all cars and prices it never needs any intervention ever, Rodney can claim he’s right, even then maybe not stopping exactly where Rodney wanted it to, might be proof that self driving doesn’t work.<p>Next big thing after deep learning prediction is clearly false. LLM is deep learning, scaled up, we are not in any sense looking past deep learning. Rodney I bet wanted it to be symbolic AI, but that is most likely a dead end, and the bitter lesson actually holds. In fact we have been riding this deep learning wave since Alex-Net 2012. OpenAI talked about scaling since 2016 and during that time the naysayers could be very confident and claim we needed something more, but OpenAI went ahead and proved out the scaling hypothesis and passed the language Turing test. We haven’t needed anything more except scale and reasoning has also turned out to be similar. Just an LLM trained to reason, no symbolic merger, not even a search step it seems like.</div><br/><div id="42652682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42652682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benreesman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42651933">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653752">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42652682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42652682">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Waymo cars can drive.

As the article author points out, <i>lifetime miles</i> for “self-driving” vehicles (70M) accounts for less than 1% of <i>daily</i> driving miles in the US (9B).<p>Even if we suspend that perspective, and look at the ride-hailing market, in 2018 Uber&#x2F;Lyft accounted for ~1-2% of miles driven in the top 10 US metros.

First of all, companies take a long time to measure dev output, it&#x27;s not like you can look at a burn down chart over two sprints and decide to fire half the team because it seems they&#x27;re working twice as fast. So any productivity gains will show up as layoffs only after a long time.<p>Secondly, dev productivity is very rarely significantly bounded by how long boilerplate takes to write. Having a more efficient way to write boilerplate, even massively more efficient, say 8h down to 1h, will only marginally improve your overall throughput, at least at the senior level: all that does is free you to think more about the complex issues you needed to solve. So if the task would have previously taken you 10 days, of which one day was spent on boilerplate, it may now take you, say, 8-9 days, because you&#x27;ve saved one day on boilerplate, plus some more minor gains here and there. So far from firing 7 out of every 8 devs, the 8h-to-1h boilerplate solution might allow you to fire 1 dev in a team of 10.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42653303" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42653303" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">baq</span><span>|</span><a href="#42652057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653076">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653509">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42653303">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42653303">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Induced demand means we’ll need more devs than we have right now since every dev can produce more value (anyone using cursor for a longer while should be able to confirm that easily).<p>The problem is different in the meantime: nobody wants to be paying for training of those new devs. Juniors don’t have the experience to call LLM’s bullshit and seniors don’t get paid to teach them since LLMs replaced interns churning out boilerplate.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42653351" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42653351" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rcpt</span><span>|</span><a href="#42652057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42652168">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42652328">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42652221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42653351">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42653351">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to get work as a copywriter now</div><br/><div id="42653826" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42653826" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RamblingCTO</span><span>|</span><a href="#42652057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42652221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42653826">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42653826">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was thinking about this.

2. human work is seen as boutique and premium, used for marketing and market placement

I am not in the camp of being skeptic so I still like the hype cycle, they create an environment for people to break the boundaries and sometimes help untested ideas and things to be explored. This might not have happen if there is no hype cycle. I am in the camp of people who are positive as George Bernard Shaw in his 2 quotes:<p><pre><code>  1. A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.
  2. The reasonable person adapts themselves to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to themself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable person. (Changed man to person as I feel it should be gender neutral)
</code></pre>
In hindsight when we look back, everything looks like we anticipated, so predictions are no different some pans out some doesn&#x27;t. My feeling after reading prediction scorecard is that you need a right balance between risk averse (who are either doubtful or do not have faith things will happen quickly enough) and risk takers (one who is extremely positive) for anything good to happen. Both help humanity to move forward and are necessary part of nature.<p>It is possible AGI might replace humans in a short term and then new kind of work emerges and humans again find something different. There is always a disruption with new changes and some survive and some can&#x27;t, even if nothing much happens its worth trying as said in quote 1.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42653607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42653607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">qznc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42652124">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42651932">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42653607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42653607">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If someone wants to have a credible prediction scorecard, get it on some third-party platform like Metaculus, Manifold, GJOpen, Polymarket, ...</div><br/></div></div><div id="42651932" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42651932" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#42653607">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42653643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42651932">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42651932">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Related.

The thing stopping flying cars from existing is that it is extremely hard to make an easy to pilot flying vehicle, given the numerous degrees of freedom (and potential catastrophic failure modes); and the significantly higher impredictability and variance of the medium (air vs road surface).<p>Plus, the major problem of noise pollution, which gets to extreme levels for somewhat fundamental reasons (you have to diaplace a whole lot of air to fly; which is very close to having to create sound waves).<p>So, overall, the energy problem is already fixed, we already have point-to-point flying vehicles usable, and occasionally used, in urban areas, helicopters.

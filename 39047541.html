With every disorder, you need to tick enough boxes in order to fall under the definition (currently using DSM-V though I know one org stubbornly sticking to DSM-IV as it benefits them). Not all boxes may apply, or may apply severely. It is the same in other disorders. But also personality disorders define our very being and are very different to combat, so to conform to them is living in acceptance and harmony with them. Ie. it is something one has to live with. Anyone diagnosing a (personality) disorder worth their salt is going to explain this much better than I just did. And of course one can reap the benefits of a disorder. Stephen Fry, the actor (also a terrific writer) famously is bipolar (a term with a predecessor being manic depression). One thing which triggers some people with autism is wording; they don&#x27;t have autism; they&#x27;re autistic. Personally, I don&#x27;t give a shit about it, but I feel the same regarding pronouns like they&#x2F;they. Apparently it is a really big deal for others and I need to remind myself about that. Otherwise, I cross the line of bullying. But when I am describing myself or in general (not someone specific) I feel at liberty to pronounce the way I want.

If one has the phenotype, but isn’t impaired by it to a clinically significant degree, one does not have the disorder (ASD), but one does have the broad autism phenotype (BAP; aka the broader autism phenotype or subclinical ASD). [0] The number of people who have the phenotype without the disorder is likely several times those having the disorder. The broad phenotype is particularly common among close blood relatives (parents&#x2F;siblings&#x2F;children) of those with the disorder. It is also has an elevated prevalence among STEM professionals.<p>I think it is unfortunate there is not greater public awareness of BAP and its distinction from ASD. Probably many of the people who describe themselves as “on the spectrum” in a colloquial sense have BAP not ASD.<p>[0] strictly speaking, one can speak of a narrow autism phenotype (phenotype with the clinical disorder) and a broad(er) autism phenotype (phenotype without the clinical disorder), which together make up the autism&#x2F;ASD phenotype as a whole. Given the distinction between the two is clinical, it is possible in theory for the exact same phenotype to be broad for one person and narrow for another - one person might be in a less supportive environment which produces clinical impairment, the other in a more supportive environment in which impairment remains at a subclinical level - impairment arises through phenotype-environment interaction, it is not always inherent to the phenotype in itself</div><br/><div id="39052102" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39052102" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CobaltFire</span><span>|</span><a href="#39048890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051722">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052272">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39052102">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39052102">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the terminology here!

It is a dimension, a continuum, (even a set of dimensions) not an either-or category. Of course, at certain level of extremity or severity of impairment, the dimensional becomes effectively categorical. But as you move along that continuum in the other direction, there is no clearcut boundary between it and &quot;normality&quot;&#x2F;&quot;neurotypicality&quot;, nor is there a clearcut boundary between it and other distinct forms of &quot;aneurotypicality&quot; with which it has significant overlap (e.g ADHD, OCD, the schizophrenia spectrum, personality disorders, PTSD, eating disorders, giftedness and intellectual disability). Clinical diagnosis is always going to have a subjective element – cases far from those boundaries almost everyone will diagnose the same way, but near those boundaries the diagnostic outcome often says more about the clinician than about the patient&#x2F;client. The boundary is shifting over time, it varies geographically, and it is questionable to what extent the justification for that spatiotemporal variation is scientific, as opposed to social&#x2F;cultural&#x2F;political.<p>Do I have autism?

(which in his thesis he refers to by the pseudonym &quot;Allied Health&quot;) – management was already aware that three clinics had significantly different diagnosis rates, but those differences were being ascribed to patient characteristics and referral patterns. Based on statistical analysis of medical records, Colatat argues that neither of those explanations actually work, and instead the real explanation is differences in the professional culture of each clinic – an explanation he backs up by considering the organisational history of the clinics, and the different diagnostic philosophies which influenced their respective founders. He concludes that approximately one-third of the outcome of an autism diagnosis in those clinics is determined by the culture of the clinician – and he notes that, despite these significant differences in clinical culture, they were all specialist clinics which put great emphasis on diagnostic rigour, and many diagnoses are done in generalist clinics with significantly less rigour, so it is entirely possible the cultural contribution might turn out to be even bigger if one brought those diagnoses into the analysis. So, one third (maybe even more) of the time, whether you have ASD depends, not on you, but on which clinician you see.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39051413" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39051413" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">faeriechangling</span><span>|</span><a href="#39048890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051210">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051380">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050614">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39051413">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39051413">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; had such a hard time researching autism after someone mentioned it might apply to me because I found most articles to be very stigmatizing.<p>&gt; I question whether pathologizing differences is that useful.<p>Homosexuality was first referred to as a &quot;Sexual Deviation&quot; and a &quot;Sociopathic personality disturbance&quot;.

It&#x27;s no longer considered a disorder but gender dysphoria still is.<p>Autism is still a disorder, and nothing but a disorder.  Autism is defined medically, wholly by weakness, as if that&#x27;s all autism is.  Something we should maybe cure one day, or come up with a pre-natal test for so be can have abortions to ensure such people aren&#x27;t born.<p>The &quot;Gold standard&quot; treatment for autism Adaptive Behaviour Analysis has some common heritage between the treatment of Autism and Transgenderism, which involved using adversives (torture), to get people to act in a more gender conforming or less autistic way.  I still think about that.  If you use essentially the same treatment to modify the behavour of a transgender person or an autistic person, if you do it to the former it&#x27;s a hate crime, if you do it to the latter it&#x27;s a medical necessity[1].  I find that VERY revealing as to medicines attitude towards the Autistic, that they are the broken ones who need to change to fit our glorious and perfect society.<p>The pathologization of Autism is a crime against humanity and probably the first or second most evil thing that has happened to me throughout my entire life.  Autism wasn&#x27;t always a pathology - go 50 years back and nobody considered Autistic here would be considered Autistic by a doctor, wouldn&#x27;t be considered &quot;Disordered&quot; by their peers, they might have been considered odd but not disordered.  Nowadays, there&#x27;s too much money in pathologizing people as disordered, everybody from parents to schools to doctors to social workers to the autistic people themselves benefit.<p>I see the status quo as fucked up and firmly believe modern psychiatry has greatly compromised Autistics quality of life through their hateful views on Autism which rub off on the wider popuation.  When these esteemed medical experts call you disordered - why shouldn&#x27;t everybody else think you are?<p>The way forward I see is how we handled homosexuality and transgenderism - de-pathologise being different from other people - but diagnose people with mental conditions that impair quality of life which are associated with Autism - and use those diagnosis&#x27;s to allocate support and funding.  This model also lets you make more sense of things like how both the richest man in the world and profoundly disabled people who can&#x27;t hold down a job could both be &quot;Autistic&quot;.<p>[1]ABA is not necessarily evil, it&#x27;s more how it&#x27;s used for the purpose of making autistics less autistic or transgender people less transgender which is philosophically fucked up</div><br/><div id="39051496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39051496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xwolfi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39048890">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051413">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051873">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39051496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39051496">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Conformance is an advantage, a way to progress and get what you need or want.

Realistically, tolerating differences can only go so far as the other tolerates it: autists and transgenders have similar issues in accepting that the wider society is different from them and the compromise has to start at both ends. And I think nobody&#x27;s really asking anyone to actually change behavior, but simply to hide it better in temporary&#x2F;crisis&#x2F;exceptional situations.<p>For instance, I think homosexuality&#x27;s long combat to marry, a very VERY conforming demand, is helping it move away from the view others had of it being a non-conforming sexual behavior.

GI problems are comorbid in like ~40% of autism cases.  Do schools stress getting these autistic kids exercising and teaching them how to cook healthy meals so they can overcome these struggles, live a life without pain, so they can not only live a higher quality of life but have an easier and more pleasant time being social?  Sometimes - but the overwhelming emphasis is simply making them act more normal in a very simplistic and direct and to the point way.  The system isn&#x27;t designed to improve autistic kids quality of life you see, it&#x27;s designed to make them less troublesome for the people around them, and hold them accountable for the trouble they&#x27;re causing, that&#x27;s people&#x27;s mindset.<p>There is a very cold and unemphathetic attitude towards autistic kids where they&#x27;re just expected to be iron willed stoics who behave using a fake personality that pleases others around them while their underlying issues basically get no attention from the system.

This can lead to situations, especially where law enforcement is involved, where people get killed.  Physical abuse from parents towards autistic children—once again due to lack of empathy—can cause outbursts to be excessively violent.<p>If you have difficulty reading autistic people, there&#x27;s training for that, but on the other side, asking autistic people to not meltdown is akin to asking an epileptic person trying not to have a fit.  If someone gets particularly violent during meltdowns, they essentially need to be kept away from other people.  This can&#x27;t be trained out with therapy.<p>&gt; Are they telling the truth?<p>If they&#x27;re autistic, likely answer is: To a fault.  A higher IQ autist (archaically &#x27;aspies&#x27;) can learn social mechanisms, rarely even over and above a neurotypical, but with greater conscious effort and delay.<p>&gt; or with not randomly swerving their car into a crowd because fuck knows why<p>Sounds like a conflation with psychosis.  I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s relevant.  Many autistic people do struggle with driving and may have dyspraxia, which may require more lesson time, or not qualifying a driving test.

* have better social skills and social understanding
* use apparently socially manipulative and shocking behaviour[3][4]

I&#x27;d like a conversation of such insights as you might have about this and autism, given the fact that also when I was a child, I felt like I was pretty much just watching the life around me and taking notes, or not developing attention and communicating with kids my age in school or making friends.<p>If you want your kid to talk more but they have autism, maybe introduce from an interest of their&#x27;s to a conversational style designed to be technical and teach the vocabulary of the thing that they like learning about.</div><br/><div id="39051825" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39051825" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomjakubowski</span><span>|</span><a href="#39049657">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39049860">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39051825">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39051825">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  Look for a red and infrared light for winter and even summer use.

There are a large number of genes[1] that are related to autistic individuals, and it&#x27;s a very heterogeneous condition. In particular many, perhaps even most autistic individuals don&#x27;t suffer from intellectual disability, don&#x27;t have any physical characteristics which would set them apart from others, and don&#x27;t tend to have problems with memory. All of these are characteristics of Fragile X syndrome.<p>&gt; “Imagine being at a party, talking to a friend while music is playing in the background,” Frick says. “You have to integrate the sound of their voice with the movement of their lips.” But if there’s variability in sensory processing, socializing will be more challenging, he says.<p>And I&#x27;ll take issue with this in particular. Frankly, the social issues of autistic individuals are wildly overstated and can be easily explained. Believe me, I know quite a few autistic folks and none of them have issues understanding when someone is speaking, we can tell. However, trying to sync up different minds that operate in different ways is a difficult problem.<p>Even among men and women with the same neurotype there&#x27;s enough difference to cause _substantial_ misunderstandings. Enough ink has been spilled on the topic of relations between the sexes to fill oceans. And the difference between neurotypes is far more substantial than the difference between sexes in this regard. It&#x27;s very easy for me to socialize with other autistic folks, I&#x27;ve had many conversations that have lasted hours on end. Doing the same thing with someone who is neurotypical though is much more difficult, and usually requires a willingness to put up with the awkwardness of not having the same vibe.<p>Finally, I won&#x27;t go into anything about using mouse models for complex neurological conditions at the moment. But suffice to say, this article would be more properly titled &quot;Noisy brain may underlie some of Fragile X syndrome&#x27;s sensory features&quot;, but that probably doesn&#x27;t get the same amount of attention.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gene.sfari.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gene.sfari.org&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39050670" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39050670" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wegfawefgawefg</span><span>|</span><a href="#39051698">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050633">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39050670">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39050670">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The connection between noise and the emergent consequent of that noise being autism is quite an assumption.

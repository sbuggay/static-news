Yes, Kruschev&#x27;s Secret Speech was the cause of their schism, but why did all the premiers who followed Kruschev fail to right things with the Chinese?  And why did Kruschev not find a way to smooth things with Mao?  &quot;Look, that Speech is not an attack on you, it&#x27;s just me shoring up support in the USSR by attacking Stalin, and that works because Stalin made himself so feared, m&#x27;kay?&quot;  And why wouldn&#x27;t that work, as long as the Speech stayed Secret and even if not, as long as it stayed out of the public eye in China?  Well, ok, Kruschev couldn&#x27;t keep it that secret, but still, the premiers that followed him could have denounced that speech and made things ok with China.  But this hostility survived Mao&#x27;s death, even when Deng Xiaoping essentially (but not overtly) accepted Kruschev&#x27;s position against personality cults!  Why?  Only now, maybe, the Russians are finally repairing that schism.<p>Really, TFA is <i>extremely</i> interesting.<p>And yes, it&#x27;s clear that to some degree Mao and Kissinger were playing roles, being flattering and saying things they probably didn&#x27;t really mean.<p>And then there&#x27;s Mao&#x27;s quip about Americans not being &quot;awakened&quot;.

He just published another book and just celebrated his 100th birthday.<p>He started out as a German Jewish refugee. Fought in WW II and became an American, ended up being part of the post WW II effort to administer Germany, and then started his career in political science and international politics.<p>The nineteen sixties and seventies were a complicated era. The war in Vietnam was an ugly affair, and Kissinger&#x27;s involvement with negotiating the peace deal is what earned him a controversial Nobel peace price. It was also the peak of the cold war and Kissinger was basically coordinating policy in a number of proxy wars across the world. Iran&#x2F;Iraq, Chile, Vietnam, etc. and projecting US power everywhere he could.<p>Calling him a war criminal is a bit rich. But undeniably some of the decision making at the time backfired in a big way and Kissinger was at the core of a lot of that. Both during the Nixon era and long after when he advised administrations all the way until now.<p>Particularly the decision to prop up a lot of corrupt despots in order to prevent the Russians from gaining influence has caused a lot of long lasting conflicts that continue to play out today. You could make the point that the US ultimately won the cold war. Albeit at the cost of triggering a lot of other ugly conflicts.<p>The Iranian revolution is probably one of his bigger failings. Triggered directly by him backing the wrong horse in Iran, which ultimately lead to the Iranian revolution, the US providing military aid to Iraq, the Iran&#x2F;Iraq war, the Iran contra affair (where the US provided weapons to Iran) the Russian&#x2F;Afhanistan conflict where they US also provided lots of military aid, both Gulf wars, more recently the Afghanistan and Syrian conflicts. And there&#x27;s of course the decades long support for the brutal regime in Saudi Arabia, the US involvement in various revolutions across Africa and South America. There&#x27;s a pattern there of the US backing the worst regimes in order to divide and conquer and gain&#x2F;expand its influence and power. That&#x27;s what big countries do.<p>Was Kissinger involved with and personally responsible for all of that? Probably not but he was definitely advising a lot of politicians and this soft power via military aid, diplomacy, meddling, propping up despots, etc. definitely is his style. But he was only in office for a few years and during that time his big focus was ending an ugly war in Vietnam that he did not start. There were hard line politicians before and after that. He certainly has been on the sideline advising many of them for decades. Especially the hard line policies under the Reagan and both Bush presidencies have his finger prints all over them and he also consulted Democratic presidents like Carter, Clinton, Obama, and Biden. But does that make him a criminal? If so, there are a lot of other war criminals.

Maybe Japan and Korea are more ethnostates.. but it&#x27;s sorta ridiculous to say it&#x27;s an Asian things<p>Within 5 minutes of arriving in Kuala Lumpur you will see more diversity than in most American cities - with equal parts Indian, Chinese and Bumi (ethnically Indonesian). I mean.. maybe they all just look &quot;asian&quot; to you, but they&#x27;re distinct to anyone from the region. On top of that you will regularly see people from the middle east and elsewhere.<p>The Chinese, outside of han-nationalist circles, typically do not see themselves as an ethnostate (but by contrast the Taiwanese sort of do) - that was sort of the central theme of the 2008 olympics.. and I&#x27;ve met many minorities in China that would be confused and maybe offended if you suggested they weren&#x27;t Chinese<p>So by extension Taiwanese also view themselves as Chinese, but typically not part of China geopolitically. ( a lot of the issues here stem from linguistics.. b&#x2F;c in Chinese there are many separate terms to distinguish things like ethnic Han, culturally Chinese, Chinese citizens of the PRC and other subtleties - I&#x27;m not going to pretend to understand all of them)<p>Thailand is also incredibly pluralistic, though minorities are more integrated into one culture.<p>There isn&#x27;t typically &quot;founding father&quot; hero worship and the same ideological cohesion as in the United States, but it&#x27;s also simplistic to say that doesn&#x27;t exist at all. You have for instance Sun Yat-sen who is .. sort of founding-father-like (his ideology doesn&#x27;t seem as coherant as in the US though) . If you want ideological though, the most obvious is Maoism.

Most people don&#x27;t in a personal capacity connect with historical events.. But the reason you don&#x27;t see black people &quot;become Chinese&quot; is mostly because the culture is basically too big and deep to integrate with.

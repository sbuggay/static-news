But in reality, it would be very surprising if performance and evaluation of performance were independent. We expect people to be able to accurately rate their own ability. And D-K did indeed show a correlation between the two, just not as strong of one as we would expect. Rather, they showed a consistent bias. That&#x27;s the interesting result.

That&#x27;s not the same as saying everyone thinks they&#x27;re slightly above average, nor that people&#x27;s self-assessments have no predictive power whatsoever. The lowest performers still think they&#x27;re below average, just not as much as they should. The highest performers still think they&#x27;re considerably above average. But they all have a bias toward (slightly above) the middle.<p>So yes, people are generally correct in the direction that they deviate from that median self-assessment, but that just shows that people&#x27;s self-assessments aren&#x27;t completely without basis.

We expect people to be able to accurately rate their own ability.<p>This seems to be attacking an irrelevant point in the analysis. The argument goes as such: Researcher carries out all the studies needed to prove the Dunning-Kruger effect, then trips and drops all the results into a vat of acid. But he&#x27;s ashamed and quickly generates random numbers for the results, and somehow the data still proves the Dunning-Kruger effect. Not just that, repeating the same exercise again and again with completely random data leads to the same result, the effect is always present. So is the Dunning-kruger effect so powerful that it exists in the very fabric of the universe devoid of any human interaction, or is something amiss?<p>In this situation we are forced to look at the test we have that concluded from the data that the Dunning-Kruger effect exists and conclude that it&#x27;s a bad test, we need something different.<p>You seem to be arguing &quot;oh no, you can&#x27;t look at random data, because we wouldn&#x27;t expect the experiment to yield random data!&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t work as an argument for why the test should still be considered good. If it&#x27;s supposed to have any worth, then the test has to be able to come to one of two conclusions: The Dunning-Kruger effect exists or the Dunning-Kruger effect doesn&#x27;t exist. And if the test is set up such that for positive experimental results, or just random noise, it comes out in the positive, and only in extremely unlikely and a narrow band of the possible outcome space come out negative, then the test is bad.<p>If we want to try to rephrase everything a bit to make the issue much clearer. Lets set up a coin-toss competition between ChatGPT and a group of 100 people. Each participant goes 1:1 against ChatGPT where both parties toss a coin and whoever has the most heads wins, on draws toss again, in case a pair goes into an infinite loop that doesn&#x27;t end before our allotted trial time, they get removed from the study. A human assistant tosses on the behalf of ChatGPT on account of it not having arms yet.<p>Now we ask each person how they would rate their ability vs. ChatGPT in a coin-toss, everyone answers 50&#x2F;50, for obvious reasons.<p>So we run the experiment, the line for &quot;ability plotted against ability&quot; is a straight diagonal line. The line for estimated ability vs actual ability is a a straight flat line at 50%.<p>Eureka! To the presses! we have just proven the Dunning-Coin-Kruger effect! People who are worse at throwing coins tend to over estimate their ability, and people who are better at throwing coins underestimate their ability! What a marvelous bit of psychological insight, it really tells us something about how the human mind works, and has broader insights about our society! But naturally we always expected this outcome, people who are bad a tossing coins are dumb and of cause they are overconfident, not like people who are good at tossing coins who have a remarkable Intellect about themselves and are therefore humble in their self estimation... and so on and on about preconceived biases that have nothing to do with the actual test we performed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38417237" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38417237" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IAmGraydon</span><span>|</span><a href="#38416100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38417811">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38416187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38417237">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38417237">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So what we have here is some scientists trying to prove that the Dunning-Kruger effect doesnât exist and instead they give us a perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</div><br/><div id="38417300" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38417300" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wyldfire</span><span>|</span><a href="#38416100">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38417237">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38416187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38417300">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38417300">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The irony is that the situation is actually reversed.

Dunning Kruger is not a statement about predicted score correlating with actual score in some way. It states that predicted score does not correlate well with actual score. This can be rephrased as the prediction error having a negative correlation with the actual score. The article then claims that this negative correlation is autocorrelation. That is true but the correlation still exist. The thing is that ideally we EXPECT there to be no correlation of the prediction error with the actual score, but we find autocorrelation. Going back to variables where this autocorrelation is not there, we EXPECTED to find a 1:1 positive correlation between predicted score and actual score but find no correlation, or a weak correlation.<p>So finding autocorrelation when you expected to find no correlation is pretty much the Dunning-Kruger effect here.<p>In fact their example with the random data totally makes sense: Suppose people uniformly randomly estimate their performance. Then the people who are low skilled will consistently over-estimate and the people who are high-skilled will consistently underestimate. Of course there is no causation here, as the people choose randomly, but there is an undeniable correlation. I guess the question is if you view the Dunning-Kruger effect as a claim to low skill CAUSING positive prediction error, or just correlating with it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38418577" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38418577" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chmod600</span><span>|</span><a href="#38418345">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38419159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38418577">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38418577">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A related effect that I&#x27;ve wondered about is: perhaps lower-skilled people compare themselves to the general public, while perhaps skilled people compare themselves to a smaller group of skilled peers.<p>In other words, if you asked me if I&#x27;m good at riding a bicycle, I&#x27;d compare myself to others in the general population and say &quot;yes&quot;.

Happy to answer any questions or get answers if you stump me.<p>My own work is on the connected initiative called Data Rights Protocol which is aimed at providing a common open source API so processing the legally required data rights requests by Consumer through the Permission Slip app can be faster, cheaper, and better. That’s at DataRightsProtocol.org I think that protocol addresses some of the questions and ideas expressed in this thread.</div><br/><div id="37807522" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37807522" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schneems</span><span>|</span><a href="#37807027">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808482">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37807522">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37807522">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would probably pay a thousand dollars if you could get NPG Van, Action Network, and Act Blue to never text or email me again.<p>I’ve aggressively replied STOP and “delete and report spam” and unsubscribing from all communication for literally years and they keep coming.

This will not completely eliminate our customers&#x27; ability to email you, and it will not delete your data from their systems. For instance, if our customer uses another system to send bulk email, then our “blocklist” would not stop them from emailing you through that system. Please note this is an all or nothing approach – we do not have the ability to apply the “blocklist” to individual customers using our email tool. If your email address is added to the “blocklist” you will not receive communications from any of our customers using our platform.<p>Then there was a link which unfortunately seems to have my email embedded in it so I can’t share it directly.<p>I started this process via making a request on yourdigitalrights.org.

Seems like the same type of service.<p>For what its worth, I think you need to go much farther than this. Saying &quot;delete my account&quot; does not do what you think it does for the vast majority of services.<p>For instaince, take reddit or discord. When you &#x27;delete your account&#x27; it does not actually delete your data. It just removes your email and changes your account handle to &#x27;deleted&#x27; - but all of the messages you sent are still there, able to be read and recalled by anyone you have interacted with.<p>This is a big reason I created <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redact.dev" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redact.dev</a> back in the day- I wanted to full delete my skype account because I didnt use it anymore. But when I went through the process, I found out (at the time) that it could simply be reactivated at any time by anyone who got the password. On top of that, all the messages I have ever sent will also be available for whoever logs in. So literally the only solution to actually delete your messages is to one by one go in and individually delete every message.<p>Also, to be clear- Most of these data broker removal services these days are making use of a mechanic where they simply email a request on your behalf to be removed. I am seeing first hand that more and more data brokers are refusing to honor these requests because they feel legally they are covered by making a &#x27;opt out&#x27; page available to the end user. The rise in &#x27;data broker removal&#x27; companies has no doubt accelerated that as well.<p>The best solution is to not go the email route, but to use the automated removal forms. Of course, these guys cant automate that so they dont do it.</div><br/><div id="37808351" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37808351" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jimmySixDOF</span><span>|</span><a href="#37807023">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808604">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37808351">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37808351">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I tried Optery (YC 22W) from an HN announcement and thought it would let me see data associations based on my email&#x2F;handles from across the web and what data brokers are doing with it but the way the system, as in dealing with Data Brokers through some freedom of information as a service like Optery, works is like a yellow pages whois lookup based on your name&#x2F;birthday&#x2F;mailing address pairing which is completely ass backwards imo.

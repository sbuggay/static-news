For example, the people in the area I live now are far more LGBT-friendly, far more accepting of different religions or no religion, etc., than the people I grew up with. This is also reflected in their voting patterns (the area I live routinely votes more progressively than even the most progressive city in Australia).<p>At the same, they are much more reserved than the people I grew up with. They don&#x27;t greet me (nor I them) unless we both look up and make eye contact, making it easy to duck your head and just be left alone when you&#x27;re running errands. (I think this is a mental survival technique for rural areas, because you are constantly running into people you know, and you would lose your mind if you spoke to them all.)<p>And they never, ever make random conversation with strangers, whereas that was the norm where I grew up. They aren&#x27;t unfriendly or unwelcoming; they just feel uncomfortable putting other people on the spot like that because it&#x27;s not a part of the culture here.<p>I think you are exhibiting some unfounded biases against rural people -- like you have this stereotype of what they must all be like, and now you are unfairly applying that stereotype to people you&#x27;ve never met. It&#x27;s ironic that bigotry is one of the traits you attribute to them.<p>I recommend going out into the world and meeting a greater variety of people who live very differently from you.

From the deafening motorbike engine in the street, to the idiot with his speaker vomitting rap music, to the neighbor having a party until 3AM, they do not care.<p>Why is that? Mostly because modern western civilizations promote a me-first culture. Look at these personal developpment books: it&#x27;s mostly about caring for yourself, barely about the others. When it&#x27;s about the others, it&#x27;s to advance your interests.<p>We do not learn from infancy to put others&#x27; interests first. Basic principles and values like selflessness are taught NOWHERE. When a problem arises here in France, you get yet another law to restrict and punish. We should just teach peoples to care for others.<p>I&#x27;m longering for a world when people care, where people who are &quot;lovers of themselves&quot;, &quot;not open to any agreement, without self-control, without love of goodness&quot; will have disappeared,<p>and where &quot;there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving&quot;, where this is applied: &quot;All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them&quot;, will be the standard.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42721597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42721597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tqi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42723059">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42722622">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42721597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42721597">[28 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Its ironic, because this dude doesn&#x27;t seem to care enough to even the slightest bit of research to understand why any of these problems he highlights are the way they are, and lazily attributes everything to OTHER people not caring.

Cold light is less comfortable and discourages hanging around, the positive spin is &quot;energizing&quot;, it&#x27;s often used in supermarkets and budget stores that value faster browsing, and impulsive decisions under a greater feeling of urgency. Warm light has a relaxing effect and is used, for example, in luxury stores and restaurants where people are intended to take their time.

I was consulting for a very large tech company on their advertising product. They essentially wanted an upsell product to sell to advertisers, like a premium offering to increase their reach. My first step is always to establish a baseline by backtesting their algorithm against simple zeroth and first-order estimators. Measuring this is a little bit complicated, but it seemed their targeting was worse than naive-bayes by a large factor, especially with respect to customer conversion. I was a pretty good data scientist, but this company paid their DS people an awful lot of money, so I couldn’t have been the first to actually discover this. The short story is that they didn’t want a better algorithm. They wanted an upsell feature. I started getting a lot of work in advertising, and it took me a number of clients to see a general trend that the advertising business is not interested in delivering ads to the people that want the product. Their real interest is in creating a stratification of product offerings that are all roughly as valuable to the advertiser as the price paid for them. They have to find ways to split up the tranches of conversion probability and sell them all separately, without revealing that this is only possible by selling ad placements that are intentionally not as good as they could be. Note that this is not insider knowledge of actual policy, just common observations from analyzing data at different places.</div><br/><div id="42722274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42722274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bee_rider</span><span>|</span><a href="#42718547">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42721611">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42719775">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42722274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42722274">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing you know about ad guys—they are really good at tricking people into spending money.

Which means they lean into other sources of revenue, or ways to reduce costs.<p>Elsewhere people care about <i>value</i> more than price, and are willing to spend more to get more.

They do care more than most countries where I have visited or lived.  There is a real send of &quot;excellence&quot; about their public behaviour that is hard to replicate.  For example, when you queue to board a train, people stay to the side to allow passengers to exit.  After others have exited, they board the train.  (Tourists sometimes make the mistake of rushing into the train when the doors open, but it only takes one try to figure it out!)  Ask yourself: Why do they do it?  I don&#x27;t why, but I observe it on the daily, and the incentive to behave well in public is pretty low in a modern (&quot;selfish&quot;) society.  I feel the same about littering -- the amount of litter in public places is astonishingly low in Japan.  Another tiny thing that you may notice: When in a busy public place where two groups of people are crossing one another&#x27;s path, people in Japan make an effort to allow one person to cross from each side.  It is like watching a ballet performance when you see it.<p><pre><code>    &gt; Japan is right to discourage foreigners from moving and living there.
</code></pre>
This is a myth.  Japan (and, coincidentally, Germany) welcomes three groups of foreigners: (a) students (language and university, mostly), (b) low skill workers (factory, farm, retail), and (c) high skill knowledge workers.  I would say it is much easier to get (<i>and keep</i>) a work visa in Japan compared to the US.</div><br/><div id="42720446" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42720446" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yakshaving_jgt</span><span>|</span><a href="#42719788">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42719971">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42721289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42720446">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42720446">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is how trains work in Bangkok also, and Thai culture is very different from Japanese culture.<p>This is just how trains work in that place.

I don&#x27;t know how to replicate it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s magic. I&#x27;ve heard people bandy about the theory of cultural homogeneity. That might be a _factor_, but I doubt it&#x27;s the full story.<p>I suspect if you dig into it, differences in economics are a major factor. In the US, it feels like caring is actively punished, economically. Caring is nice, but someone can only _afford_ to care if their other needs are met.<p>I also wonder if density is a major factor - not so much for the difference in economy of scale, but the difference of &quot;if my physical space is incredibly constrained, I&#x27;m both more incentivized to keep it looking nice, and there&#x27;s less of it to keep looking nice.&quot;<p>And, of course, it&#x27;s not like Japan is some kind of otherworldly utopia.

For example, people will often blame local government for issues such as not disposing of fly tipping garbage quick enough, but they will not do much to clean up the pavements with sofas or fridges around their house – a man with a van can often drive over these large bits of garbage to a recycling centre for like $30&#x2F;£30 an hour. Sometimes people will say government is spending money poorly, but they will not have participated in any of the consultations the government did on the matter, even if they were online or accepted mail-in comments. And in workplaces, they will often blame other departments without having put in elementary effort to resolve the issues with them. Sometimes people will blame government services for collapsing – there are certainly many YouTubers that constantly moan about how bad public transit is in many regions of the US, but few will donate to groups and politicians that genuinely want to replan public transit. Few will campaign for them, which can be done online in the fraction of a time it takes to produce a video.<p>If an org gets taken over by the blamer culture, it is doomed. These people will make no attempt at fixing problems, even when that would sometimes take 5 minutes and an email, but they will moan. And they will blame, and sometimes they&#x27;ll blame the person suggesting an easy and workable course of action to resolve the problems.<p>Interestingly, sometimes resolving the problem takes less effort than sustained moaning, and certainly less mental strain. And still, people who tend towards the blamer group will blame and moan.

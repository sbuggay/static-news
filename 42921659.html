I&#x27;ve tried Hinge a few times.

Some notable points:<p>&gt; The other thing that interests you is the like ratio, or the openness, among 100 profiles that the user sees, how many of them does he like? (The median for men is 26% and for women is 4%.)<p>&gt;The like ratio of a girl is almost independent of the profiles she sees. For example, if a girl has a like ratio of 5% and you remove 50% of the profiles, even if you remove only the profiles she will not like, her like ratio will still be 5% (you can do that by removing very unattractive people for a guy that is very attractive, for example). It is funny to observe, but it seems like a girl has internal reasoning on a dating app, and they know they can only like x% of profiles whatever she sees (of course, it doesn&#x27;t work if you show only ugly people).<p>And lastly:<p>&gt;Whats interesting is that the more attractive the guys were ranked by girls the more they were looking for something not serious.</div><br/><div id="42939971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42939971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marinmania</span><span>|</span><a href="#42921885">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42940875">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42939971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42939971">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a theory for the swiping behavior of women.

If you used Hinge back then, you&#x27;ll remember some key differences between the platform and other dating apps: 1) when you &quot;like&quot;&#x27;d someone, you&#x27;d have to comment on a specific part of their profile (a photo, a prompt answer, etc), 2) these likes showed up in their inbox, independent of whether they liked you or not (as in, you didn&#x27;t have to like each other mutually; the other end decided whether to reply or ignore after delivery), and 3) there was limit per day, you could like&#x2F;message 8 profiles per day, no more. On average, swiping through my 8 per day, I&#x27;d generally get 1-2 new replies, which turned roughly into 3-4 first dates per month.<p>One of the key elements is that the inbox was time-ordered: the most recent like you received was at the top. There was discussion on the Hinge subreddit about how girls would typically only click through the top few items in their inbox daily, and if you were lower down, you were doomed to drown under the mountain of new message they&#x27;re getting on top. So I figured I&#x27;d solve for &quot;what is the optimal time of day to be blasting out my likes to ensure I end up higher in the inbox?&quot;<p>You can probably see where this is going: I requested a GDPR data export, which happened to have all my conversations, time-stamped. Crunching through in Python there was something in the data I didn&#x27;t really expect.. a disproportionate number of first-replies (replies to my initial like&#x2F;message, that is) were around the 2-3pm bucket. Not what I would&#x27;ve expected (don&#x27;t these people work?) but fair enough, I started doing all my swiping in those hours instead of in the evening as I usually did.<p>And it worked. Good god did it work. I consistently started getting replies to 70-80% of my initial messages (from the ~10% before). I was drowning in conversations to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t swipe at all for days for fear of yet another conversation to manage. Within a few months I ended up meeting my current girlfriend and haven&#x27;t been back on since, but it was surprising how well something simple like time-of-day affected my reply rate.</div><br/><div id="42941917" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42941917" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kazinator</span><span>|</span><a href="#42940587">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42941470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42941917">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42941917">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; don&#x27;t these people work?<p>They do! 2-3 p.m. is around the time people get fidgety at work and start looking at the clock, checking their phones, and such.

That suggested there was kind of an optimal strategy for men and women, in that there was kind of mismatching going on in terms of who reached out to who.<p>IIRC, they were suggesting that it was good for women to reach out to very attractive men, because men in general were not getting contacted, including attractive men, but were responsive to being contacted, and a woman could take advantage of that, even if they were less attractive themselves. Men in contrast would do better to reach out to women who were <i>slightly</i> less attractive, because most of mens&#x27; attention collectively was focused on a very small group of very attractive women, and the women who were less attractive, even slightly so, were getting contacted much less often.<p>Typing this out I think the distributions were very different from in the current article, but also I think they were analyzing different things.

I&#x27;m still wondering why my tea-of-the-month business [0] got turned down by Stripe when I incorporated an LLC (technically a Godo Kaisha, as it is incorporated in Japan).<p>It came as a surprise as it was perfectly fine by them for as long as it was a sole proprietorship. Which is why I strongly suspect the rejection came from an AI. At the time of rejection we were still using the Stripe account of the sole proprietorship, and surely a human would have noticed and blocked that account if it was actually running against Stripe ToS!?!<p>It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. In any case, I know that financial regulations are stringent and payment providers are often required to leave us in the dark. But is it frustrating...<p>Now I&#x27;m stuck with PayPal for the time being. Unless they, too, decide that selling green tea is against their ToS.<p>By the way, does anyone know if it&#x27;s ok to re-attempt to open an account with Stripe? Our offering has been evolving, so we might very well be within their ToS now?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomotcha.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomotcha.com</a><p>EDIT: wording</div><br/></div></div><div id="37939921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37939921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lbriner</span><span>|</span><a href="#37939908">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37939973">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37939921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37939921">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The whole issue around not telling you what rule you broke &quot;because then you might work around it&quot; is total BS.

Even if you put a few thousand a month on the line, it&#x27;s not worth for them to consider you. Heck even if you tell your friends about it - Meta doesn&#x27;t give a shit.<p>The true Kafka-esque nightmare here though is that even just knowing someone at the company is apparently not even enough to get it properly checked out and fixed (even corporations like Google who have similar black box policies to most users have the means to do that). It seems Facebook runs on &quot;computer says no&quot; logic when it comes to cases they don&#x27;t have data on anymore. That is truly disgusting.<p>[0]: This in part because most spam detection is ultimately still just checking heuristics; revealing the heuristic simply reveals what stat to adjust for. There&#x27;s very few &quot;sophisticated&quot; detection methods - even the big email providers still just rely on heuristics combined with an internal trust score that they gain by checking how users respond to email.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37939940" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37939940" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mongol</span><span>|</span><a href="#37939921">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37940188">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37940225">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37939940">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37939940">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah exactly.

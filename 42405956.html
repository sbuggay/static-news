A lot of the discourse meant for social progress and revolution became gaurded at the highest echelons of the academic system and perverted to suit the needs of the state apparatus. In my mind, the end of this practice means at least some hope of the work moving back to where it needs to go. On the other hand, our society today is highly educated and academic work is just a job. A huge swath of the population goes through school before entering the work force: how are you going to get to them?

Nonetheless, the politicization and radicalization of social sciences in the last 15 years is undeniably problematic, and plays a role in the balcanization of society. 
Academic detachment from reality is a problem even smart academics can joke about, as they know it is somewhat of a true trope. 
The ones that certainly laugh about that the least are a lot of social scientists, in my experience. 
They are also often very far from considering the complexity of economics in their fields of studies, and that&#x27;s also an issue. 
Sprinkle some identity politics dust on it, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster, offering conservatives and anti-progressists your academic head on a silver platter. 
I believe that social sciences (yep, it&#x27;s a generalization, I know...) have failed to play academic politics properly in the last two decades, mostly due to radicalization of ideas and topics.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42406907" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42406907" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seydor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406849">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42407032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42406907">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42406907">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We are at the age of engineering human behavior and societal engineering is in the realm of STEM.  social science is like alchemy in an age where chemistry already exists</div><br/><div id="42407029" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42407029" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jyounker</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406097">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406907">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42407032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42407029">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42407029">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every time you interview a user or set up a survey to determine customer preferences, you&#x27;re using techniques developed from social sciences.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42407032" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42407032" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jajko</span><span>|</span><a href="#42406097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406907">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42406889">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42407032">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42407032">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t get why NZ is &#x27;fucked&#x27;.

I have mixed views on this announcement, I do agree with the basic sentiment that NZ is broke and has been for a long time. That means &#x27;decisions&#x27; on public spending need to be in the national interest, for the current govt, that translates into &#x27;fiscal interest&#x27;. That said, cutting &quot;all&quot; govt funding to social sciences is not the right call. I would have though that a smaller budget and stricter set of criteria for funding would have been a better approach.

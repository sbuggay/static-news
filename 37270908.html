There are layers and layers of interpretation of what systems should look like and they are different. We often refer to this as tech debt, but there is always that one box no one wants to touch because of its age and potential importance, kind of like a time capsule of when the company was once clean and orderly. I&#x27;ve see so much entropy.<p>But to the point of the article entropy only exists when external factors are introduced.

Creating room for advocacy against process changes when new additions&#x2F;changes are likely to increase entropy by introducing new outcomes.<p>Example - engineering teams can be obsessed with introducing new variables to a sufficiently stable system with the intention to improve stability. But in turn, reduce stability due to inaccurate impressions of stability of the new variables.<p>This approach generates a bias against change, but in many situations this bias is helpful. This allows engineering teams time to observe process outcome distribution over a longer duration, improving the data backing any process change decisions.<p>Edit: added explanation</div><br/></div></div><div id="37279741" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37279741" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghomem</span><span>|</span><a href="#37279660">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37279903">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37279741">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37279741">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The coin flipping example ideally would have S = ln(2), with the two outcomes being:<p>* heads, no issues<p>* tails, no issues<p>The articles says this:<p>&quot;The way to lower that maximum is to bring N to a number as close as possible to one.

There&#x27;s not much room to make things better to begin with.<p>Not sure that it follow that the same conclusion applies in the cases of other engineering processes you listed, like &quot;configuring a Linux base image for a specific server role&quot; or &quot;setting up a complex cloud environment from scratch&quot; or... &quot;approaching a stranger in a bar&quot;?<p>Those are already higher entropy processes, with more desirable and more undesirable outcomes, where telling the difference between desirable and undesirable outcomes is much harder to begin with, and so the general advice of &#x27;expend energy to reduce the likelihood of undesirable outcomes&#x27; doesn&#x27;t so immediately suggest that adding what you call &#x27;complexity&#x27; is necessarily bad. There are MANY paths to reducing entropy in these sort of situations. Complexity that adds more outcomes <i>can improve the situation</i> in these cases if the new outcomes are both desirable and probable - or at least more probable than the undesirable outcomes they also add.<p>I just think that if the conclusions from your toy example don&#x27;t translate obviously to actionable insight into how to improve the <i>toy</i> example, it&#x27;s unlikely they translate into actionable insight for how to improve <i>real</i> scenarios.</div><br/><div id="37280134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37280134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghomem</span><span>|</span><a href="#37279660">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37280019">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37280134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37280134">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;configuring a Linux base image for a specific server role&quot; or &quot;setting up a complex cloud environment from scratch&quot;<p>^^^^^^^<p>I don&#x27;t know if you have experience working this kind of thing but these processes have a single desired outcome and multiple undesired outcomes. They can break in many different ways and they do break more often than desired.<p>One simple case related to setting up a Linux instance is when you want to have the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; python libraries without even checking if the stable versions of an LTS distribution would actually suit you. You end up with a huge list of things from pip, a list that sometimes breaks (even with fixed versions) and where security updates do not guarantee retro-compatibility. One day it works, next day it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Your process has more entropy than necessary and is less reproducible than desired.<p>If instead of a server instance you have a docker image that is rebuilt in a CICD pipeline, you have the same problem but blocking an entire team that is expecting CICD to work all the time.<p>This is just a single point of failure of many others that can coexist: a &quot;corporate&quot; transparent proxy with cache, an unreliable DNS server, a security appliance that interferes with downloads, etc.<p>As for rebuilding cloud environments you really have to go through it to see how entropy scales with complexity. I could write a couple of pages about it.. and about how people are actually building cloud snowflakes.

Thanks for the follow-up.  Your thoughts are insightful.  I hear it a lot that &quot;too much information is ruining us&quot;, but what about crap daily newspapers that came in mass around 1900, then radio, then over-air television, then cable television?  All of these are about providing large amounts of low quality information.  These days, you can get satellite TV with 500 (five hundred!) channels.  It must be 99% rubbish content.  I guess the difference now is that the web is much more interactive, and our minds can be more easily hooked as a result.  Dunno; when I was growing up, the kids who gorged themselves on shitty cable TV weren&#x27;t the brightest bulbs in the chandelier.  I feel the same now in the Internet era.<p>My point for this post: Each time I hear (paraphrased): &quot;It is different this time.&quot;, I try to imagine the world 25 years ago.  Then think: Is this really 
<i>that</i> different?

And I don&#x27;t mean double the length, but literally 100xtimes longer. There is a chance you accidentally find a channel with a program that really triggers your curiosity, and then you stop scrolling.
 On TikTok, this is not possible, after a couple seconds the mildly interesting content is gone. Good luck finding it again, or even remembering what you found interesting in the morning sitting on the toilet swearing &quot;you&#x27;ll check out this topic later&quot;<p>Another aspect is the quality of the content, which, chances are, higher. Not all of the programmes, obviously, but, again, you might find a documentary, an art piece (aka movie), etc. On TikTok&#x2F;instagram&#x2F;yt&#x2F;Facebook reels anyone can post any rubbish, without any curation, and it&#x27;s up to some algorithm to decide if it&#x27;s shown to you.<p>Not to mention the regimen you create, the ritual if you like, of sitting down in front of the TV at the time your beloved programme is aired.<p>I used to think a lot about the &quot;it&#x27;s the same as TV &#x2F; newspaper &#x2F; books used to be&quot; argument, and I definitely believe it&#x27;s not. Especially since I dated the &quot;book reader&quot; and the &quot;insta story addict&quot; persons and tried to have conversations with them about topics. Day and night.<p>In fact, I started going back to TV. Not the smartphone-controlled &#x2F; streaming kind, but using the remote. And scrolling through the handful of channels I added to favorites. I do sometimes stop at a random program (yesterday I just learned that there are venomous beetles in Switzerland!). Sometimes I won&#x27;t and switch the TV off, and just stare out on the windows.<p>TV doomscrolling is bad (news channels to the front). A bit less worse than &quot;social media&quot; (scrolling addiction).

This can be anything from cultural things like gender discussions to conspiracy theories to scientific theories. If there are generalized models that explain a lot of phenomena, the brain likes those, but at the same time they can also take the place for when empirical evidence should have been gathered (that doesn&#x27;t fit with the general model), and so in that sense they can be hazardous. And models that already have stood up to a lot of empirical data are especially hazardous because they have already proven themselves to some extent which means there&#x27;s even less incentive to gather empirical data. Or at least that&#x27;s my current (maybe hazardous) general view.<p>I also don&#x27;t think we should give up on generalized models because they are so powerful and useful, but it&#x27;s definitely a challenge in todays climate because they get so many clicks and they are very satisfying to know.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40559120" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40559120" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schmidtleonard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558939">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559123">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559208">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40559120">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40559120">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; TikTok isn&#x27;t useful<p>If information is increasingly hyper-abundant and attention is not, we must increasingly learn to value high bandwidth &#x2F; compressed communication.

Everything you learn in that class is in the textbook. The textbook will even teach you math in a more formal way than a teacher will (at least mine did).

If that&#x27;s all it was, I wouldn&#x27;t use it. No, the primary reasons are: to improve your professional standing, attract an audience that can be monetized, and learn useful information in your field (which can also be monetized). Or to make it even simpler: money, and power.<p>That changes the perspective on what has value and what is worth saying &amp; doing.<p>For example, &quot;low effort content&quot; obviously has value if that&#x27;s your goal, since you can spend 10 minutes crafting some tweet about your profession with low reach, or 10s photographing your food for a similar result. If you can type out something low effort than you can squeeze it in during work hours, for example - and building an audience is one example of how that could pay off.<p>Second, if money and power are your goal, then getting very familiar with marketing content is useful also. You have to learn what engages people and what gets people to sign up for stuff, even if its tedious or slightly cheesy. And hanging out on social media is how you do that.<p>Finally, if there are useful professional jewels amid all the chaff, then it may be okay that 95% of it is junk, if 5% of it is good. I will say that there are times when I&#x27;ve sworn off social media, then dipped back and noticed, actually, I do learn useful stuff here.

Computerized too when lots of the chemical plants still didn&#x27;t have that either.  For a while there I had the only advanced abilities in this type analysis.  This is the modern apparatus in use today that was seen only rarely for research purposes when I set it up the first time for routine use.<p>The technology was very well set to emerge on its own.  Nothing that wouldn&#x27;t have been done without me eventually, and by about 10 years later most operations had progressed in that direction, in many analytical fields besides chemicals, without any relationship to my particular early effort.  But I&#x27;ve probably still run more experiments in this field than anybody else who didn&#x27;t start that early.<p>With the employee turnover of a measurement bureau having an inherently outdated approach to staff, alternative international testing labs were eager to pick up our people who knew how to do this.  Bigger companies knew I was up to something the whole time but I was not trying to hide anything, just not giving away the details.<p>When it comes to alcohols, at the beginning all the PhD&#x27;s who were established chided me that it couldn&#x27;t be done the way I had in mind.  Little did they know I had already validated it for a year, so they didn&#x27;t actually turn out to be wrong in the end.  They were all wrong from the beginning and I knew it as I went along.<p>And that&#x27;s just the apparatus, which is all over the world now, plus for alcohols well-standardized internationally.  Even though the standard allows for lower performance and uses lesser math than I had implemented originally.<p>Now that I have officially retired from my last employer, I still consult and earlier this week the manager called me about a specialty chemical on the way that nobody knows how to do and there are no publications.  We&#x27;ll see if this ship comes in.<p>It&#x27;s really just a non-toxic hiatus for me, I grew up in a retirement community, so unspoiled resort life has already been accomplished and well behind me for decades.<p>Still deciding whether it&#x27;s best to present the advanced math at a conference this year or next.  That I will be able to take full credit for if I want to, and it could be quite popular now that people have the corresponding apparatus already.<p>Regardless, the way we do it is slides and lecture only, no publication will necessarily be forthcoming.<p>That reminds me, I don&#x27;t disclose much but last time it was 2021, maybe a week after Windows 11 was released.  Here&#x27;s how I did it, being the only one seen with W11 (even up to this year w10 outnumbers it 10:1).  Two laptops, neither one fully meeting the stiffest software requirements, one with HDMI, the other much further out-of-date with VGA.

Far from being &quot;junk information&quot;, I believe it to be a wonderful opportunity.
Rather than avoid it, we should do the exact opposite by seeing the extraordinary opportunity in adverstity.
What opportunity?
The opportunity to mindfully explore why it triggers the emotion of rage in us.
Why is this useful?
Because rage is an accurate predictor of a learning disability that is holding us back from reaching our full potential.
Both as individuals and as a species.<p>Learning disability?
What do you mean?<p>The Buddha pointed out that avijjÄ, the choice to ignore uncomfortable truths, is the root cause of all suffering.
The Buddha called such rage bait, the first arrow.
The first arrow is, in reality, a notification of sensory motor misprediction.
We experience this notification of misprediction as pain because this alerts the brain to the existence of an error in our sensory motor predictive model.
In order to restore equanimity as we move through this domain of sensory experience, the brain <i>should</i> respond by striving to correct the error in the model so that sensory experience is predicted correctly.
With the error corrected, we can now move through that domain of sensory experience without anxiety; confident that our model will guide us to make good decisions.
Most of the time, we do this.
However, sometimes, a bias we have prevents us from doing so.
The Buddha called such biases, Äsava.
The path to liberating the mind involves the total destruction of the Äsava.<p>The suffering we experience in response to rage bait then is an inner conflict between 2 strategies to satiate our craving for the restoration of the certainty of an accurate predictive model of sensory experience.
1: The more intelligent strategy of seeking to find and correct the error in the predictive model so that we can &quot;see the world the way it actually is&quot;
and
2: The less intelligent strategy of clinging to bias and demanding that sensory experience bend to our will now.<p>i.e. between
1: mature delayed gratification
and
2: immature immediate gratification<p>ALL suffering we have ever experienced, are experiencing and will ever experience is an inner conflict between these 2 parts of us pulling in different directions.
ALL suffering we have ever experienced, are experiencing and will ever experience is resolved by extinguishing the craving for things to be different than they actually are now in favor of seeing the world the way it actually is.<p>We don&#x27;t see it as such when we are doing it, but suffering is clearly a learning disability.
Were we to free our mind of all such learning disabilities, rage bait would have no effect on us whatsoever.
In this regard, rage bait everywhere should be seen as a wonderful opportunity to free our minds of a learning disability that is preventing us from contributing to our full potential.
Both as individuals and as a species.<p>What might billions of minds liberated from bias in this fashion be capable of producing?
For this reason, &quot;rage-bait&quot; should be embraced as a wonderful opportunity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40559978" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40559978" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">richrichie</span><span>|</span><a href="#40559437">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559107">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40559978">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40559978">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My theory is that the intellectual (or knowledge worker) periodically wakes up feeling immense guilt about his life of extraordinary physical comfort.

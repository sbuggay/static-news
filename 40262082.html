It&#x27;s more secure and allows a wider more diverse suite of apps to integrate into it.<p>From the article:<p>&gt;While we’ve deprecated the Google Fit Android API, we’re aiming to turn down the API no sooner than June 30, 2025. This is to give users enough time to switch to Health Connect and continue their service.<p>Specifically they indicate,  as they have in the past, that developers should transition from the Google Fit API to the Health Connect API. The Google Fit app already uses the Health Connect API itself to upload health data to a centralized repository.<p>The article also mentions no &quot;big updates&quot; since 2022, while I can&#x27;t gauge what they&#x27;re qualifying as &quot;big&quot;, there have been 20+ app updates since that time frame and there is a major beta release ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.google.and...</a> ) that has been in public testing for some time now.</div><br/><div id="40263209" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40263209" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anty</span><span>|</span><a href="#40263095">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40263025">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40263209">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40263209">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It&#x27;s more secure and allows a wider more diverse suite of apps to integrate into it.<p>It&#x27;s more secure, yes. But since the data stays on the device now, web apps cannot read or write health data anymore. You need to develop a dedicated app to access the data on the device. And the user has to interact with the app, or the data will not be accessible.<p>E.g. my Withings scale writes my body weight to Google Health Connect. But I need to open the Withings app every time for that to work. The app-developers cannot do this in the background afaik.
(The data flow is: scale -&gt; cloud -&gt; app -&gt; Google Health Connect.)<p>Another issue I see is: There is no incentive for app developers to write data to Google Health Connect.
Even if you subscribe to the idea of using it as your data-store, you will lose access to the data if a user uninstalls your app. It&#x27;s only possible to read data up to 3 month in the past, or however long the user has installed your app – hopefully they don&#x27;t decide to reinstall it.<p>I really appreciate the inter-connectivity Google Health Connect allows between apps, though.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40263025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40263025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lionkor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40263095">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40263134">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40263025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40263025">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Free things are only free until they become<p>1. discontinued<p>2. commercialized (paid), or<p>3. broken with nobody to fix it<p>IMO the only free services and free software (free as in free beer) you can rely on is software that is open source or source available (in its entirety).<p>Lets disregard the &quot;youre the product&quot; (and the fact that the hardware wasnt free) for a second and focus on the fact that all these dead services have one thing in common: They shut down because theyre centralized, or because their development is centralized.

The first thing that got replaced is the Fitbit Sleep tracking, and believe me when I say what Google did is an abomination in terms of UI&#x2F;UX design. The previous Fitbit sleep tracking screen was near perfection of readability and clarity. The new one is Google&#x27;s usual form-over-function design language where the most important metric (weekly-view sleep score) is hidden and requires many taps to access.</div><br/><div id="40263177" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40263177" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nineteen999</span><span>|</span><a href="#40263134">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40263177">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40263177">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Honestly the Fitbit UI has always been terrible, so they are only making it worse than terrible.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Ignoring Ethernet. Refusing to use adobe&#x27;s print engine and having the slower printer. Demanding the Mac have fixed memory for cost, and gains 512k because his engineers ignored him.<p>I would love to read how Woz reflects on this. &quot;Oh, well.. that was Steve&quot; vibe I guess.<p>I was dealing with apples across this time, we had a Canon laser printer which was a giant barfridge beast but the print quality was awesome, and it was fast. All Apple had was &quot;yea but it&#x27;s small and it works well with your mac&quot; which of course was all it needed once you were in Adobe print production. And for mass media you could make colour separates for bromide and real printing. But Maaan it was a pain for a Unix person to deal with that applenet crap.<p>We had a phototypesetter which had one guru who could drive it in nature, he spoke hex to it lovingly. Nothing compares to microfilm font. I loved the immediacy of the apple printer but for real camera ready 10,000dpi is where you went. It was slow, but gorgeous.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37430056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37430056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imperialdrive</span><span>|</span><a href="#37430123">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37430056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37430056">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really enjoyed this subject, and style of writing.

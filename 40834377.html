Many ski resorts have a snowmaking reservoir at elevation and a pumping system to fill it (usually off peak) and then use gravity to actually feed the snowmaking guns (at least partially). Almost every snowmaking manager (that I talked to) has had the idea at some point to try some sort of pumped hydro offset, but I&#x27;m unaware of anyone who has actually tried it.  It would be fairly small scale (reservoirs can be ~20 million gallons, usually less) but it would be interesting to see the economics of it because the infrastructure is already there (pumps, pipes, reservoirs, etc).  The systems generally even sit unused for 7-8 months of the year.<p>I think some of the challenges are that while most resorts have a fairly massive pumping system, it&#x27;s usually geared towards slowly filling the reservoir, with the rest direct feeding the snow guns. Not many places have the need to fill a 20 million gallon reservoir in a couple of days.<p>There&#x27;s also the probability that the head pressure&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t work out.  Gravity feeding from an upper reservoir near the top of a large mountain can result in thousands of PSI at the bottom if not passed through a series of pressure relief valves.  I&#x27;d imagine ideally you would have to build a generating station and a new catch reservoir at the perfect elevation because if you are pumping a lot higher than needed the efficiency is going to drop significantly.</div><br/><div id="40845142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40845142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pbmonster</span><span>|</span><a href="#40844806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40854221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40845142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40845142">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;d imagine ideally you would have to build a generating station and a new catch reservoir at the perfect elevation because if you are pumping a lot higher than needed the efficiency is going to drop significantly.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a concern. There&#x27;s hydro plants with more than 6000&#x27; of head, leading to almost 3000 psi of pressure at the turbine and an exit velocity of the water jet of over 600 ft&#x2F;s. From an engineering standpoint its totally manageable, and results in a highly efficient turbine.<p>&gt; I think some of the challenges are that while most resorts have a fairly massive pumping system, it&#x27;s usually geared towards slowly filling the reservoir, with the rest direct feeding the snow guns. Not many places have the need to fill a 20 million gallon reservoir in a couple of days.<p>Good news is that adding another pipe with its own pump&#x2F;generator is relatively cheap. Bad news is that 20 million gallons is a relatively small reservoir for pumped hydro, and increasing that is expensive.<p>Still, seems like an easy and fast way to get some additional capacity online, especially in cases where a couple of megawatt of new solar get build in the vicinity of that damn...</div><br/><div id="40846296" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40846296" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gorbypark</span><span>|</span><a href="#40844806">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40845142">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40854183">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40846296">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40846296">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The only problem of 3000 PSI is 99% of the snowmaking pipelines out there would instantly blow up at that pressure :)<p>You would also need to have PRVs anyways, because anything above about 700psi (900 if you are pushing it) is unusable&#x2F;unsafe to use by the actual snowmakers and equipment.

Is that a cost of $881-2450 USD per kwhr?<p>I presume there is ample room for cost blowouts as well.<p>LiPo cells are currently costing about $110 to 130&#x2F;kWh (USD), and trending downwards. Now large scale storage batteries are more than just the cells  (Tesla megapacks are selling for 1.39M for 3.916 MW or about $410&#x2F;kwhr), and cells probably wear out quicker than a dam, but it seems the Onslow scheme is not giving great bang for buck. The best you could say for it is that a lot of the spend would stay in NZ because a lot of the spend is in labour.<p>Am I missing something? Is my math wrong? It seems to me spending 16 billion becoming experts in assembling large scale batteries would be a better long term investment for NZ. And they can get access to the storage as it is build, instead of waiting 10 years.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mbie.govt.nz&#x2F;dmsdocument&#x2F;28349-identifying-potential-sites-for-large-scale-pumped-hydroelectric-energy-storage-phes-in-new-zealand-september-2021" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mbie.govt.nz&#x2F;dmsdocument&#x2F;28349-identifying-poten...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;battery-prices-collapsing-grid-tied-energy-storage-expanding&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;battery-prices-collap...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tesla_Megapack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tesla_Megapack</a></div><br/><div id="40844592" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40844592" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jltsiren</span><span>|</span><a href="#40843640">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40843980">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852862">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40844592">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40844592">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your math is off by three orders of magnitude.

Wind turbines kill birds so wind farms are bad. But the alternative isn&#x27;t that we just don&#x27;t use less electricity. And Wind farms may kill more bald eagles than coal mines, but as a resident of an area where coal was king, I would disagree if anyone said they are less harmful overall.<p>There is a term for this type of comparison but it is escaping me right now.</div><br/><div id="40854620" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40854620" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robertlagrant</span><span>|</span><a href="#40844403">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40847607">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40853165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40854620">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40854620">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Wind turbines kill birds so wind farms are bad<p>I&#x27;ve read it more that &quot;wind farms are not an unalloyed good&quot;, which counters something I do read.<p>In generaly, this example seems pretty weak. Trump might&#x27;ve exaggerated the number of this particular type of bird being killed, but by far more he massively underplayed the numbers of the total number of birds being killed by them. Seems as though people are reading a lot into this, when you could more easily read the opposite into it: Trump downplaying damage to non-bald eagles!

In other words does a drop of 500 feet produce the same power as a drop of 1000 feet? I assume there&#x27;s a limit on how fast a turbine can spin and also a terminal velocity for water falling through a tunnel?  Not sure if I am asking this right but for wind turbines for example 60 mph wind and 40 mph wind are the same, there&#x27;s a limit on how quick those blades can spin.</div><br/><div id="40853752" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40853752" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">uboot</span><span>|</span><a href="#40846552">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852749">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40853752">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40853752">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is a limit, but it is rather high.

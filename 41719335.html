Names are identifiers.<p>2. Names can be used to  correlate the same person between two systems.<p>These assumptions are not universally correct, and so programmers and designers and product managers try to restrict names in order to minimize edge cases and maximize the cases in which their assumptions hold.<p>And these same folks make the same mistakes about names of things as they do about names of people.  If a human provides the name, then you are taking on a huge pile of problems using the name as an identifier.  Take DNS domain names or AWS S3 bucket names or NetBIOS names in Windows networks or (pick your favorite flat namespace ).<p>The solution?<p>Always use system-assigned (preferably random) identifiers for things that need identification.  Think UUIDs.  Make the name a descriptive text property of the person&#x2F;thing that they can change at any time.  Consider not having names for humans, but rather just asking the user for the strings that you would like to use in certain places, eg:<p>“When we validate your provided credit card, what is the name that the bank expects?”<p>“What should we put in the ‘name’ spot on packages or letters that we send to you?”<p>“To make this app more friendly, we would like to address you by name.  If that is ok, type the name that you would like us to use in this situation:”<p>[  Foo       ]<p>Here’s what it will look like:<p>Hello, Foo<p>(No thanks)  (OK)<p>Etc etc.</div><br/><div id="41738265" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41738265" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elric</span><span>|</span><a href="#41738093">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41738269">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41738265">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41738265">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Couldn&#x27;t agree more.

In cultures such as parts of Southern India, Malaysia and Indonesia, a large number of people have names that consist of a given name only, with no patronym.<p>Yes, please! For eg., in my part of south India, people&#x27;s last names used to be the name of their caste. When caste discrimination became somewhat uncool, most people stopped using those caste-based last names and being mononymous (having just the &quot;given name&quot;) became the norm.<p>Now, because most US-based services make entering a last name a necessity, there&#x27;s a resurgence of caste identity in names here. A lot of others use their father&#x27;s name or the name of their home city, and end up being addressed as &quot;Mr. &lt;City name&gt;&quot; or &quot;Ms. &lt;Father&#x27;s name&gt;&quot; in communication.<p>In general, a lot of people here find the whole firstname-lastname business just confusing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41738035" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41738035" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Jun8</span><span>|</span><a href="#41738269">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41738174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41738035">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41738035">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Other random information about names that I find interesting:<p>* The US habit of addressing all people, eg even the CEO, by first name in business setting would be unthinkable in most other cultures. This is one aspect that many foreigners stumble at (email heading using “Dear Sir” is typical).<p>* Some languages&#x2F;cultures heavily use shortened names (eg Mike, Herb, Liz), even in formal settings. Again this would be a huge faux pas in other cultures. Even if people have and use such names, it would be unthinkable to address them if you are not close friends (eg Memo is an informal shortened form of the Turkish Mehmet)<p>* Commonly, names are chosen from a culture specific fixed set, which evolves on the order of a decade or so (not exactly true, eg the name Apple and many others) but a good approximation. In other countries names are generally made up from words, with desirable meanings, AFAIK names in Chinese are of this kind. Of course all names started this way, eg Peter=stone but I’d guess most people don’t know the meaning of their names in this sense, ie what does Elisabeth mean?<p>* Related to the above, one thing I was surprised to learn about Chinese names is that it is hard&#x2F;impossible? to know the gender of the person from just the name. Sure, English has un-gendered names, too, but they are really small minority.<p>Totally unrelated, but how proper names work (ie, how they refer) is a big area of discussion in Phil of Language.

We didn&#x27;t really do anything with the information, so we didn&#x27;t need to know your postal code as such. We just need to be able to print a customers address on a label. The amount of systems that for some reason wanted to know every separate part of the address was just crazy, and again never really used for anything. One system would map the address fields into another, from there again mapped into a third system and then mapped into the label print system. Why not just have a text box, and parse that through?

Things vary state-to-state, and even within states, across castes and subcultures. However, this also makes it somewhat easier to gauge where someone is from. Over time, you recognize some name patterns and you can guess that they&#x27;re from a specific place, speak a specific language, etc.<p>For a very generic example, if I encounter someone with the surname &quot;Singh&quot;, I&#x27;m reasonably sure they&#x27;re from the northern states, and likely speak Hindi apart from their native tongue. Also in terms of identifying someone&#x27;s given name, they&#x27;re usually from a broadly known pool. As an analogue to western names, if someone says their name is James or Marie, you&#x27;re mostly guessing that&#x27;s their given name, even though it&#x27;s possible to have those as last names as well (eg.

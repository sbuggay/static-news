As a software engineer and electronics hobbyist, I find so many interesting things in ham radio circles. And if you’ve never experimented with RF stuff, you are missing out on a lot of fun.

I have several times in my life tried to explore this hobby but mostly was turned off from it by the fact that it didn’t seem to offer much compared to what I could do on the internet aside from using public spectrum. Don’t get me wrong, I think it is cool and I see the use case for emergency response situations. But the idea of the community just never struck the cord with me how other communities have (mostly old white dudes, it seems).<p>Am I wrong? Is there a place for hams in the world where you can more quickly and reliably reach anyone from anywhere across the internet?</div><br/><div id="42083621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42083621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wglb</span><span>|</span><a href="#42083414">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42085117">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42083621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42083621">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Chicago Marathon has an association with the North Shore Radio Club to provide emergency communications. With so many people concentrated in a very small area, cellphones are not reliable. This has likely saved lives.<p>The recent hurricane to hit North Carolina had enormous support from ham radio as evidenced by someone who lost all power and internet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qrper.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;helene-aftermath-update-insurance-uncovering-full-extent-of-damage-and-gmrs-progress-friday-november-1-2024&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qrper.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;11&#x2F;helene-aftermath-update-insurance-...</a>.  There were many instances there of power lines not being down, but simply not existing any more.<p>A recently concluded event, called the CQ World Wide contest, had over 30,000 participants. A large station will make as many as 10,000 contacts in a 48 hour period exchanging basic information. Some countries call this &quot;Radio Sport&quot;.<p>A US-based contest, called Sweepstakes had been going on since 1930.<p>A very fun event is called Field Day and takes place in June. It covers North America and participants set up emergency communication facilities as well as presenting ham radio to the public.<p>A recently-formed activity called Parks On The Air encourages setting up often very temporary stations in parks across the world. Activity on this is nowadays quite high with all manner of awards. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pota.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pota.app&#x2F;</a> for details and index to activities.<p>A similar activity, called Summits on the Air (SOTA) has participants climbing peaks and putting them on the air. Some of the participants take up a challenge of building a portable station that weighs less than one pound, as some of the trails to get to the peaks require lots of hiking.<p>Some of the more capable hams spend significant time and energy building stations, such as K3LR: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.k3lr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.k3lr.com&#x2F;</a>. This is one of the biggest stations in the world.<p>One of the more significant challenges is to bounce signals off the moon and contact other hams. This is quite difficult and requires lots of RF power as well as serious antennas. The WSJTX set of protocols has made this easier, but not simple.<p>There are also satellites that support two-way ham radio communication. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amsat.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amsat.org&#x2F;</a> for detailed information.<p>There is an enormous amount of activity in building your own rigs, particularly low-powered rigs. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qrp-labs.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qrp-labs.com&#x2F;</a> for example. There are many, as well as instructions on how to build them from components.<p>Many of these are not possible to do on the internet. For example, contacting 10,000 other stations in a 48 hour period with point-to-point communication. Or bouncing signals off the moon.<p>Adventurous souls often travel to nearly inaccessible locations to put them on the air. One recent example is an expedition to Bouvet <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3Y0J_Bouvet_Island_DXpedition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;3Y0J_Bouvet_Island_DXpedition</a>.  I had the fortune to go to Vanuatu in 2000 with a group from our club.<p>An activity that is declining in popularity is to collect contacts with US counties, of which there are 3,007 in the US. The emphasis in this is contact with mobile stations from the counties.<p>This is only a summary and there are many other activities and fields of interest in Ham Radio. It can simply do some things that are not feasible on the internet, and can support activities that the internet normally handles when thing go down.<p>If you look at K3LR&#x27;s web site, you can see his support of youth.</div><br/><div id="42083865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42083865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wrycoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#42083414">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42083911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42083865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42083865">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for taking the time to write this up!

Since then, two things have happened that make use of Ham in emergency communications more of an &quot;excuse to use a cool toy&quot; than an actual necessary component of a solution.<p>First, FRS &#x2F; Part 95B.<p>Second, and maybe primarily, satellite communications have come a long way.<p>And even on the extreme off-chance that transmitting on Ham spectrum or using FRS outside of Part 95B is necessary... well... in an emergency situation... just fuckin&#x27; do it?<p>So Ham exists for fun and for education.

But I think that use-case is more-or-less dead. (The tool is perfectly good... it just doesn&#x27;t have the network effects and usability of the other tools, and a combo of sats and FRS is good enough almost-always).<p><i>&gt; Perhaps when all cell phones can reliably and routinely communicate with satellites, emcomm on ham radio won&#x27;t have much purpose.

But we are at the point where (a) satellite communication is extremely cheap, (b) authorities can be accessed via satellite as easily as 911 (or easier), and (c) people who can help but not official responders but in a place to help are WAY more likely to have satellite+FRS than Ham.

What&#x27;s the point? There are cheaper and better solutions. Abuse will be minimal because infinitely simpler solutions just aren&#x27;t that expensive these days.

Huge volumes from lots of different sources w&#x2F; the same call-sign such that it&#x27;s ruining the amateur purpose of the use should be easy enough to investigate. If stations don&#x27;t identify, well, that problem already exists and so do the solutions.<p>BUT, if it does become a problem, you can solve it in a variety of ways. If congestion really becomes an issue after the rule change, it can be rolled back. Or the rules could be written with &quot;automatic triggers&quot; based on congestion.

In the case of rural volunteer services they have nowhere near the expertise or hardware capability of an even half serious ham, and many in the scene are former military comms guys who love to help out.<p>It’s very rare that you’ll call on the 60 year old ham with his $25,000 station capable of using a rotating directional beam antenna to put out 1000 watts to relay a message to a team of emergency services who aren’t responding, but when you do and it saves a life you tend to see it as an advantage and not some guy waiting for an excuse to use his cool toy.<p>Edit: and I’m not sure where the FRS mentions are relevant since it’s pretty far from being anything hams or emergency services would go near.

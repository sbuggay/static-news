The House (aka the Lower House) proportionally represents states by population, while the Senate (aka the Upper House) represents states equally.<p>This is because the two Houses are responsible for different duties: The House legislates matters concerning finances, among other things, while the Senate legislates matters concerning government appointments and foreign policy (eg: treaties), among other things.<p>Certain matters should reflect the larger states better, while others should strive to not disenfranchise the smaller states as much, and the duties tasked to the two Houses reflect that practical reality.<p>Any bills must also pass both Houses in order to become part of the law of the land. This is so larger states cannot exert excessive influence over the smaller states. Remember: The United States is a federation of states, if smaller states are disenfranchised for the sole reason that they are small, there can be no union.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36889861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36889861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HenryBemis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36887169">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36889389">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36889455">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36890362">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36889861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36889861">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I live in the EU and I have been in the USA plenty of times and it is a great country with great people.

So the Electoral College serves to emulate Congress, which is a method of representation that all states will agree on.<p>Incidentally, Congress can and will choose the President in the very unlikely event that the Electoral College deadlocks and fails to carry out its duty. This is considered a constitutional crisis, however, and it&#x27;s a situation we all want to avoid.<p>Personally, I like the Electoral College because it reflects the above described political structure of the United States and the systems necessary to maintain it.

Social media has not been a boon for kids or really anyone except marketers. On top of that video games absolutely target kids to spend money and are addictive. Roblox is built on this, so is Fortnight and similar games.<p>Lets try regulation and see what happens; something has to change.<p>Overall this is not a substitute for parents knowing what their kids are doing and regulating their media intake.</div><br/><div id="36887246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36887246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danShumway</span><span>|</span><a href="#36887118">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36887366">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36887246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36887246">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is frustrating to read, and I hope that my reply doesn&#x27;t come off as too snippy. But it really feels like people will do anything, including throwing away rights to privacy, infringing on free speech, and ignoring the advice of over 100 civil rights advocacy groups -- all just to avoid breaking up a few companies or directly legislating algorithms.<p>I just do not understand how weakening constitutional rights is on the table for you and so many other people before antitrust is.<p>It&#x27;s not even the least invasive compelled speech option! If you&#x27;ve got to target speech, then on one hand we have, &quot;giving the government the power to decide which platforms are liable for what and requiring that teenagers have their speech surveilled online even though multiple government actors involved in the bill are open about the fact that they&#x27;d like to use the government to suppress LGBTQ+ speech and consider all LGBTQ+ expression to be harmful for minors&quot;, vs &quot;force social media platforms like Facebook to use a timeline rather than displaying algorithmic content.&quot;<p>Both would be compelled speech, but if you absolutely have to compel something the second is a lot less dangerous than the first. Every time these conversations pop up there a few people gesturing wildly at the word &quot;antitrust&quot;, and everyone else is saying, &quot;well, we&#x27;ve tried literally everything possible, maybe we&#x27;re at the point where we really <i>do</i> need to build a surveillance apparatus for every teenager in the US, there&#x27;s just nothing else we can do.&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t have to infringe on the rights of every single minor in the country, you can <i>break up abusive companies</i>. It&#x27;s totally allowed. We&#x27;ve done it before and it was great! Breaking up companies can be a healthy bonding activity for a divided country that&#x27;s fun for the whole family and brings us all closer together, so just give it a try ;)</div><br/><div id="36889081" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36889081" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrekandre</span><span>|</span><a href="#36887118">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36887246">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36887366">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36889081">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36889081">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><p><pre><code>  &gt; all just to avoid breaking up a few companies or directly legislating algorithms.

If you think about it, kids can just use sites outside of the US and avoid all this hassle.<p>So my suggestion would be for these lawmakers to mandate the FTC to come up with apps to monitor undesirable content and notify parents who can the  council their kids or restrict access and content as they see fit.<p>That way, all the privacy&#x2F;eff people don&#x27;t have to worry about tech megacorps spending money on this or them having to age verify and hire more staff and lawyers. Kids don&#x27;t have a right to privacy from their parents, although as they get older and show responsibility and maturity they should get more privacy rights.<p>The pattern I see here is similar to how schooling is done where the school basically raises kids instead of parents. Hold parents responsible and accountable but give them tools and training to succeed instead of expecting tech companies to do the raising for them.<p>I will say this though, there is nothing at all more valuable that a parent can give their child than discipline. A close second to that might showing them how to be in a healthy relationship first hand, by being the actual parent and carefully teaching them to be realonsible and then trusting them with rights like privacy and making life changing decisions for themselves.</div><br/><div id="36887399" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36887399" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#36886638">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36887399">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36887399">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So my suggestion would be for these lawmakers to mandate the FTC to come up with apps to monitor undesirable content<p>And certain people would classify âundesirable contentâ as publicizing the fact that gay people exist and that there are other ways to prevent teenage pregnancies than abstinence.</div><br/><div id="36887504" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36887504" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JoshTriplett</span><span>|</span><a href="#36886638">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36887399">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36888010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36887504">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36887504">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly.

Worsr case, social media companies might be forced to cooperate with third party content filtering services to help them identify things like cyberbullying or groomong and notify parents before their kids self-harm (again, final decision or even the decision to collect&#x2F;use that info is up to parents).

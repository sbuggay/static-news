With one exception, a major fire in New York City. Three weeks of downtime for 170,000 phones for that.[1] The Bell System pulled in resources and people from all over the system to replace and rewire several floors of equipment and cabling.<p>That record has not been maintained in the digital era.<p>The long distance system did not originally need the Bedminster, NJ network control center to operate. Bedminster sent routing updates periodically to the regional centers, but they could fall back to static routing if necessary. There was, by design, no single point of failure. Not even close. That was a basic design criterion in telecom prior to electronic switching. The system was designed to have less capacity but still keep running if parts of it went down.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f_AWAmGi-g8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f_AWAmGi-g8</a></div><br/><div id="40895855" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895855" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benjojo12</span><span>|</span><a href="#40895690">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895726">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895855">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895855">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That electro mechanical system also switched significantly less calls than the digital counterparts!<p>Most modern day telcos that I have seen still have multiple power&#x2F;line cards&#x2F;uplinks in place and designed for redundancy.

Most companies however don&#x27;t see the value of OOBM until they have a major fault. The setup costs can be high, and the ongoing operational costs of OOBM infrastructure and links is also significant. 
I&#x27;ve built dozens of OOBM networks using fibre and 4G with the likes of Opengear. In instances, often deploying OOBM ahead of infrastructure rollouts so hardware can be delivered to site directly from factory, rather than go through a staging environment which adds time, cost and complexity.</div><br/><div id="40895539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1992spacemovie</span><span>|</span><a href="#40895518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">OOB for carriers is significantly more complex; especially when you may be the only realistic access option in certain locations.

Even in heavy-monopoly situations, you can usually guarantee the Starlink to Internet path due to the traffic bypassing the transport carriers on the ground (bent pipe to LEO sat) and landing at IXPs&#x2F;near telco houses which egress direct to transit carriers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40895576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40895576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelmachine</span><span>|</span><a href="#40895518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895539">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40895670">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40895576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40895576">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We have a major incident wherein our firewall was totally down last month.

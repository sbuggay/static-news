At least for me, it helps to notice that if the question were rephrased “the older child is a boy, what is the probability that the younger child is also?”, then the answer would be the intuitive 1&#x2F;2. You get into this counter-intuitive situation with the question as asked because of the “at least” phrasing - the remaining possibilities in the contingency table can still apply to one, the other, or both children.</div><br/><div id="37205824" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37205824" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quickthrower2</span><span>|</span><a href="#37205641">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37205657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37205824">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37205824">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If someone has at least one boy, it is 1&#x2F;3<p>If they then say, I have a secret child-ordering X, such that the first in this ordering is a boy, I guess it is now 1&#x2F;2<p>However the receiver of 1&#x2F;3 case knows there exists a secret child-ordering where this is the case.<p>Weird!</div><br/><div id="37206333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37206333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">quickthrower2</span><span>|</span><a href="#37205641">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37205824">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37205657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37206333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37206333">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had a think about this since, and it must have everything to do with experimental setup, and the existence of the observer in the experiment.<p>Let&#x27;s set it up like this: You have 4 dads. Each dad has 2 kids covering all the combinations of kids: MM, MF, FM, FF.<p>Now if you define the experiment as: you are talking to a dad who has one boy. This was set up by the 4 dads being in the playground, and you walk you to one of them randomly and they tell you this. Now in such an experiment there is a 1 in 4 chance that you lead to a contradiction. Therefore in the 4 alternative universes we disband that option, leading to 3 universes. All equally likely. And in one of them the dad has 2 boys.<p>If the dad tells you the older kid is a boy then you have some info. What info is that? Well it depends on the precondition under which he told you that. At least a couple of options.<p>(a) He was going to always reveal to you a kid that was a boy, then tell you if it was the older or younger kid. It happens to be the older one this time.<p>(b) He was going to tell you the gender of the oldest kid.<p>In version (a) there are no universes discarded, so you are still at 1&#x2F;3<p>In version (b) the universe where the older kid is not a boy has been discarded. There are now 2 universes in which you exist so it is 1&#x2F;2.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

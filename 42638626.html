It was a massive time waste and I came out losing a years of my academic career where they lost nothing (money is absolutely not a factor for a large university, nor is stalling court proceedings to waste your life). I&#x27;m not even allowed to elaborate deeply on what it was about, the settlement for putting it behind me was a binding NDA.<p>This isn&#x27;t advice it&#x27;s just a story about what happened to me, to give you an idea of how things *could* go for you:<p>What I did to warrant initial sanctioning by my college was filing a witness statement describing a petty disorderly offense another student did. Apparently the college didn&#x27;t like that I filed a statement with the police and it did not go through their internal system. The school placed a hold and I contacted my dean by email. I was told by the dean, in writing, that I was not being sanctioned but the hold would remain until I attended a hearing to describe the incident as prescribed in the handbook. When I went to this &#x27;procedural hearing&#x27; with the other witness, they brought us in one at a time in front of representatives of the student body and the administration. At the end of my account they told me I would receive their decision and sanctions by mail. They issued formal academic sanctions and created a remediation plan not unlike what they are requesting of you.<p>I retained a lawyer at this point and ended up filing a complaint in civil. There&#x27;s nothing speedy here, judges stalled, the school stalled. Almost 2 years went by and we finally had the lawyers draft a settlement that made it possible to pursue college again. In the meanwhile they increased the sanctions on the remaining witness that didn&#x27;t sue in order to retaliate. The student we filed the statement about, apparently the school couldn&#x27;t touch since the police charged him. He got off paying a ticket and no other sanctions, last I heard he was in postgrad for mathematics and doing well for himself.</div><br/><div id="42642874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42642874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yard2010</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639331">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42642265">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42642365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42642874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42642874">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a mafia with extra steps</div><br/></div></div><div id="42642365" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42642365" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cbozeman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639331">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42642265">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42642874">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640956">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42642365">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42642365">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t have it quite as bad as you, but I did go to war once with my alma mater regarding a particularly small lab director and part-time instructor who had a Napoleon complex going on.

I developed automated registration software that would detect open slots in the full courses, and notify me via text message. While my friends were spending hours every day refreshing course schedules hoping to get into a full class, I was just waiting for a text message.

I also believe they forbid or at least frowned on students &quot;trading&quot; registrations, because they didn&#x27;t want even more people trying to sign up for high value classes and trading them as a commodity.<p>So at least back when I went there, basically any CS student could have told you that this website was a horrible idea that is sure to get you in trouble.</div><br/><div id="42641660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42641660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gorgoiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640357">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42641660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42641660">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Non-transferable class registrations decided by lottery would solve this.  Publicly visible, physical random number generation is important of course.<p>With pre-registration you can also get an idea of demand in advance, instead of having to post-hoc schedule additional classes (or concert tour dates, or airline flights, or PS5 units, or… etc.)<p>Non-transferability means the lottery is continuous.  As soon as anyone relinquishes their class, the lottery will have to run again to reallocate.  You could do this daily.<p>This is a technical solution that works but it overlooks the cultural side of a resource allocator <i>wanting</i> their resource to generate hype and demand, build up to the Big Event, and then sell out in “record time”.  I can understand that a big part of University marketing is to try to seem as popular and oversubscribed as possible, even if I don’t agree with it.<p>Finally of course, the public RNG bit feels like the most interesting.

The reason this is even an issue in the first place is because universities are aren&#x27;t adequately providing what the students want.<p>So you want to study, say, engineering.<p>First you have to apply and get admitted to the university, and many people aren&#x27;t admitted. The acceptance rate I can find for UW is 54% in-state, 46% out of state.<p>Then the university tells you that if you want to study engineering, you have to study a lot of other non-engineering things it feels like you should study. All of which are pretty costly and time consuming.<p>You might have to take courses in things you already know, because there are few courses you can test out of and the universities limit how many credits it can bring over.<p>Then on top of this, the universities don&#x27;t provide anywhere near enough adequate quality classes for students, which is the whole reason why there&#x27;s this level of demand in the first place.<p>Not only do they not provide enough, they know they don&#x27;t provide enough, so their response is since it&#x27;s &quot;really competitive&quot; they need to be &quot;really strict about making sure that no one had an edge over anyone else.&quot; It&#x27;s not about making sure students needs are being met, even for classes that the university is forcing on them. It&#x27;s about restricting students, so that they suffer a roughly equal amount from the university&#x27;s failures.<p>The attitude of the universities seems to be that since they&#x27;re the only game in town, students have to suffer through all of this. Imagine a system where students could take classes from anywhere they want, and then could get a degree just by passing assessments at the university. I imagine the number of people paying huge amounts of money for inadequate classes would plummet.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42642889" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42642889" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yard2010</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639891">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641205">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641489">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42642889">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42642889">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s funny how a perfectly organized crime is not crime at all</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42640802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42640802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scotty79</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639891">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42641205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42639320">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42640802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42640802">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is so bizarre to me that I&#x27;m not sure if I understand it correctly.

The more attention this gets the more likely a petty bureaucrat above the one responsible for this will realize their day just significantly more annoying and will likely squash it quickly and quietly.</div><br/><div id="42639805" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42639805" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mandibles</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639441">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42639570">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640017">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42639805">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42639805">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The conflict is so intense because the stakes are so low.</div><br/><div id="42640189" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42640189" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mingus88</span><span>|</span><a href="#42639441">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42639805">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640017">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42640189">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42640189">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is so true.

When the main university IT services team wanted to roll out a replacement to the student portal with a bunch of irrelevant features I mocked up a simple site with the things we actually wanted on it. Later on I re-implemented our students union website, again providing more useful information, like venue schedules and opening hours.<p>Both times we came under scrutiny for the possibility that we might be handling student data in ways that the university couldn&#x27;t control, and mostly, that we might be taking passwords on behalf of users.<p>The first was just a mockup, and while the second initially had full university auth against their open LDAP server, we quickly removed that in favour of our own auth, because it was very apparent that the password input being on our domain was a dealbreaker for the university.<p>By doing this, and by communicating carefully about what we were doing and what we were not doing, where the boundaries were, and how we handled data, we managed to win them around to some productive discussions. Most of the people we spoke to on university staff who were involved in this were not at the technical level to be able to understand, for example, having an unsecured LDAP server that we could auth against, and were only interested in the policy of whether we were allowed to do it.<p>It&#x27;s a common failure mode of software engineers to assume that because something is not technically disallowed, even though it could be, that it must therefore be allowed. This is not true.<p>What&#x27;s not clear with this project is whether the university have a fundamental disagreement with the idea of a student project providing services, or if someone has panicked that a non-approved system might be receiving passwords from students. The former is obviously ridiculous, universities should be open to this sort of innovation, especially from their students. But the latter is understandable and a fairly reasonable response, but one that does need careful handling by the student to navigate well.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42640307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42640307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hk1337</span><span>|</span><a href="#42640830">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42640406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42640307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42640307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had something similar happen to me, not threaten with expulsion and I kind of deserved it.<p>This was back in late 1990s, a group I was part of was getting a web site made on the school pages and I wanted to contribute.

Any use of the registration system other than for this purpose is considered abuse of the system. Such abuse includes, but is not limited to, buying or selling one’s seat in a class, holding seats for another student, or otherwise registering for a section that one has no intention of taking. [0]<p>The student&#x27;s project, though well-intentioned, is in clear violation of this policy. And it ought to be forbidden. There are plenty of ways this kind of a system could go wrong, including creating incentives to overregister or develop a registration black market, not to mention the technical liabilities of letting a bot talk to the database at bot-speed.<p>Now, as for follow-up conversations the student and the university have had, we have not seen these emails.

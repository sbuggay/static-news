After looking at the courses required for certain programs (such as calculus and physics for certain programs), the remainder of the six courses comprise the student&#x27;s top grades for any courses at the Grade 12 (final year) level.<p>So, a high school student aiming for a top engineering or mathematics program will not be hamstrung by a poor grade in Grade 12 English, nor will a student aiming for a top international relations program be hamstrung by a poor grade in Calculus. At the same time, the student going into a STEM program will have an exposure to Shakespeare, which can provide inspiration and a rich set of works to explore later in life. The student going into international relations may later be inspired some years later to study mathematics for its beauty as a hobby, some years later.<p>I remember the feeling that I was wasting time with many of my courses in those years, despite having good teachers for many of them—I thought my time spent on mandatory humanities courses like music took time away from more practical subjects, and I wish I took a programming course (though I did love my English classes). Perhaps this remains true for many students, but I personally took an interest in music performance as a hobby years later in life, and the years-old lessons in music theory came back to me. My English classes also introduced me to literature, which has remained a very important part of my life that has guided me through highly consequential life decisions for the better. It is unlikely that I would have taken an interest in literary works without my exposure to English in school.</div><br/><div id="41911942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41911942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">computerdl</span><span>|</span><a href="#41909948">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41910333">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41910871">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41911942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41911942">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Although I agree with the sentiment, the Ontario university system doesn&#x27;t actually work that way.

Key mathematical discoveries have been inspired by problems in computer science and physics, and many rigorous university-level mathematics books still draw from problems in these fields to motivate certain problems. At the least, they are less laboratory-heavy than Biology and Chemistry (the student could still attempt these subjects, though, and choose to omit the grades for university admissions).<p>That leaves a couple of other classes—or just one if English is required, as noted by another commenter. My school offered subjects like Grade 12 Drama, Visual Arts, and Music, where much of the grading was effort-based. In my school, most students in my classes saw these courses as a break from other intensive courses, with grades not being as much of a concern. This would allow the student to avoid using a grade for History, Economics, French (or another foreign language), or another subject.<p>The English requirement would then be a difficult challenge for the mathematics-focused student. I wish I could speak more about what it was like for most of my classmates who went on to study engineering, as many of them took the standard English course (I took a more demanding version of the course, due to personal interest). My classmates at the time did not seem to have an issue with university admissions to competitive programs despite not enjoying the subject at the time, but the other commenter makes a good point that minimum grades for admission standards have increased greatly since then.<p>--<p>[1] As an aside: a past classmate—who was brilliant at mathematics and also great with people—later poked fun some years later about the Ontario government&#x27;s naming for math courses.

I ended school with A in both and was the only student in my school without a single mistake in my exam.<p>- School gives you good grades if you managed to learn the topics at hand. Being able to learn what is needed or what you are bad at — not what you want and are good at is a skill in itself that can be important in life. I&#x27;d argue unless you are an exceptional genius (unlike 99,999% of pupils) you gain more from pulling through than you would if you called yourself a genius and focused on a single topic. Schools goal is to educate the majority<p>- pupils (and often also their parents) are utterly unable to judge which bits of school will be essential to their later life. I had many collegues who utterly hated every second of a multitude of subjects, only to years later tell me how glad they are now to have had been subjected to it (which brings me back to my first point)<p>We could (and should!) argue on how school works as a system of grades, teachers and pupils — ideally teachers would motivate students to become curious about and proficient in subjects without the motivation of good or the threat of bad grades. But if my experience as an educator at the university levels (without grades in mh case) shows one thing it is that those first semester students who are really able to judge what will be useful to them later on are not many.

I signed up for a history class that would involve doing research and having weekly discussions with a small group. I was stoked. Then the professor made a note that it didn&#x27;t fulfill the general education requirements. I had to drop it and switch to a huge-ass mindless lecture of hundreds of people. I would&#x27;ve liked to still take the more in-depth history class even if it didn&#x27;t fit the gen ed requirement, but so many of those BS classes are required that my schedule was completely packed all 4 years with zero leeway.</div><br/><div id="41911127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41911127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maxwelljoslyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#41909948">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41910364">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41910213">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41911127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41911127">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I feel your pain.

Software development can be complicated and frustrating, especially when things don&#x27;t work as you expect them to (but then, you learn and become better).

Geniuses, however cool they may be, are not necessarily the most effective increase in unit production efficiency per person that you can create. The point of the education system is essentially to create workers that make the economy productive.<p>I don’t think you can say, even all these years later, that Ramanujan, that mathematician, made the economy more productive, but he certainly increased the high watermark of human civilization and created an inspiring story for individual achievement, creative realization, and artistic and mathematical expression. There’s something sublime and transcendental—no pun intended—in the kind of truths that he was able to tease out and the unique, idiosyncratic way that he expressed them. Sort of like a Basquiat of mathematics, I suppose. Or probably better than that.<p>That aside, I think it’s unfortunate that he died of cholera or something, isn’t it? I mean, he apparently didn’t think it was unfortunate that he was going to die. And certainly, the formal education system didn’t necessarily fail him, in that a professor at a university recognized his genius and sponsored him to the UK.<p>But I think, in a sense that you identify, there is this general failure of the education systems in the human civilizations on this planet to foster perhaps the best thing that they could be fostering. They’re more like a manufacturing assembly line to produce cogs as part of the economic machine.<p>Not that there’s anything necessarily wrong with that. I think it’s good that people can have a role to play in the larger economy and that there are pathways to bring people to the level of capability where they can contribute like that. But the lack of pathways that these systems provide—those that could contribute to the creation of the full realization and expression of individual potential—I think is sad.

All knowledge that the world has ever received comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe is in your own mind. The external world is simply the suggestion, the occasion, which sets you to study your own mind, but the object of your study is always your own mind. The falling of an apple gave the suggestion to Newton, and he studied his own mind. He rearranged all the previous links of thought in his mind and discovered a new link among them, which we call the law of gravitation.

Both the Upanishads and the Yoga Vasistha affirm that the distinction between the seer and the Self is an illusion created by the mind. When this illusion is dispelled, the oneness of the Self is realized. The intellect, which seems to function as a separate tool, is ultimately part of the same illusion. True knowledge is realizing that there is no separation—everything is the Self.<p>Quoting one from Katha Upanishad 1.3.10:<p>&quot;Indriyebhyaḥ parā hy artha, arthebhyas ca param manah, manasas tu parā buddhir buddher ātmā mahān parah&quot;<p>Translation: &quot;Beyond the senses are the objects, beyond the objects is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, beyond the intellect is the Self.&quot;<p>This quote emphasizes that the intellect is still a part of the illusion.

From what I read, he he did a lot of the grunt work deriving these formulas but only published the final results, so it only appears that he conjured them out of nothing.

I can easily see how my life could have ended up like that.<p>As someone who benefited greatly from a few mentors in childhood and adolescence, my goal is to be able to give the same to at least a few other people in my lifetime.</div><br/><div id="41910848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41910848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BLKNSLVR</span><span>|</span><a href="#41909894">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41910017">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41909937">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41910848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41910848">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Was just discussing various parenting stories with my colleagues over lunch and, like relationships, childhood environment and parental boundaries (or otherwise) would likely be the greatest influence to any individual.<p>But then, if &#x27;mentors&#x27; applies to parents, then I guess I&#x27;m saying the same thing.<p>Having said that, my teenage son wastes a lot of his life playing online games with his friends, but having said that, I heard him say mid-game to a friend of his &quot;Brazilian isn&#x27;t a language you idiot!&quot;.

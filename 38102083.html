But a timing belt is preferable to a problematic engine with a timing chain, which will break at the most inconvenient time and leave you with an unexpected large bill.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38108188" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38108188" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">genter</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38108141">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38110696">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38108219">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38108188">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38108188">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Care to share some?

Chains fail more insidiously, because they get longer over time. The pins eat away at the plates, increasing the spacing between the rollers. This isn&#x27;t immediately noticeable, because the timing sprockets will wear to match the altered dimensions of the chain. Worn chains cause all sorts of subtle timing problems and the lifespan of a chain is much less predictable, because it&#x27;s highly dependent on lubrication; missed oil changes or poor oil quality will drastically accelerate chain wear.<p>From an enthusiast&#x27;s perspective, a chain is probably preferable, because it tends to give you some warning before it fails - you might hear a rattle at idle, you might have problems with starting or misfires, you might get a check engine light and an EBD-II code from the timing sensors. That&#x27;s a much less scary prospect than the potential for a sudden and catastrophic failure of a timing belt.<p>From a manufacturer or dealership&#x27;s perspective, belts have some clear advantages. Unless there was a manufacturing defect in the belt, they&#x27;ll almost never cause trouble if replaced according to schedule. That has obvious liability implications - it&#x27;s not their fault if the customer ignores the specified replacement interval, but it potentially is their fault if a chain wears faster than expected. BMW, VAG and Jaguar Land Rover have all recently settled class action lawsuits related to the premature failure of timing chains.</div><br/><div id="38110697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38110697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Moru</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38108559">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38110153">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38110697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38110697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m more of a hobby bicycle mechanic.

[0]) are the sweet-spot for me. New enough to have modern safety features (like airbags - I know, funny to refer to that as modern) - but still be user-serviceable.<p>I bought an relatively &quot;bad condition&quot;, top of the line (at the time) 4Runner for well less than 10 grand, spent 40 hours of effort on DIY repairs and maintenance over the course of a month. Ended up with a &quot;bulletproof&quot; machine that not only passed inspection - it&#x27;s a pleasure to drive, is modded to my liking. That 40 hours of effort would have been less than 10 for a seasoned mechanic, and the bill would have brought the total cost of the car to maybe just slightly over $10k.<p>Finding a physical copy of the service and repair &quot;manual&quot; (it&#x27;s 8 volumes...) for the exact make, model and year of the car was easy and cost $100. Spent a few hundred on specialized tools, and about 1.5k on parts. The car is old enough that there are several old-school forums with a wealth of knowledge on everything from muffler replacement, rust-removal tactics, to transfer case repair - and those forums are still incredibly active!<p>Also, now that I&#x27;m apparently mind dumping, my personal advice for people living in rust-prone areas (the rust belt, northeast, etc.) - if you can, get a used vehicle from another area. If you can&#x27;t - fine - but make sure you can inspect the frame rust, do the &quot;hammer check&quot;, etc. Remove any rust you can, get an undercoating, and wash regularly (especially during winter). BUT don&#x27;t be too scared of some frame rust, especially if the price is right. Lots of body-on-frame cars&#x2F;trucks are actually pretty structurally repairable if you hire a good tech to do the rust cleaning, sawing, and welding. Also, a frame swap is actually quite doable for a few grand if you find a good shop (people do do it themselves but without experience and a full shop it&#x27;s a pretty dangerous and hardcore endeavor) and are able to source a frame (often less than $1k plus a few hundred in shipping from a scrap yard in the south - or just buy a second used car that&#x27;s &quot;worthless&quot; for all the reasons yours isn&#x27;t, and swap that frame).<p>[0] My experience with cars of this era is mostly with Toyotas and Subarus - both makes are very user-serviceable (IME Subarus are easier, but on average the parts more bespoke and more expensive, Toyotas are more finnicky to work with on average but way cheaper part-wise and way easier to patch together in a pinch). I&#x27;ve worked on a Honda Pilot from that era, it was also a breeze - and tons of DIY-focused car people are &quot;Honda for life&quot;. I know a couple people who swear by Nissans from that era, but they caveat that with transmission issues for certain models in certain years (I don&#x27;t remember which).</div><br/></div></div><div id="38107861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38107861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bandyaboot</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38107726">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38110137">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38107641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38107861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38107861">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Bring back carbs and crank starts!

With kids getting in and out, I wouldn’t want it to be any faster. And unlike in the article, they don’t stop until they actually encounter resistance - which worked fine the one time my kid closed the door on me when I was fetching something out of the back seat.<p>The proximity sensors do beep pretty loudly every time I get near an obstacle - which is frankly more often than not when parking, and my wife does find it pretty annoying. But it’s a large car, and visibility around the front and rear corners is not great - so I appreciate having an extra audio cue when I’m approaching an obstacle. Often my goal is to get as close as possible to said obstacle when parking (wall, fence, etc) - so my cue to stop is when it finally plays the long sustained beep to let me know that impact is imminent.<p>I’ve only had automatic breaking engage a few times. Mostly when I back into a parking space too fast and it thinks I’m going to crash - which is easy enough to avoid by going a bit slower. Once it engaged while I was stopped at a traffic light due to a massive downpour which I guess confused the proximity sensor. That was annoying, and could have been worse if I were actually moving, but I just turned it off with a button on the dashboard and carried on.<p>I find lane keeping assistance (which engages automatically with cruise control) to be incredibly useful on highways, and while it does get wonky sometimes in heavy snow or around construction sites, the car is pretty good about disengaging the feature automatically when it gets confused and makes a ding to let me know. At that point I’ll usually just turn it off manually with a button on the steering wheel until conditions improve. The article mentions needing to keep applying force to the steering wheel even when stopped, but my car doesn&#x27;t require that.<p>There’s also a lane departure warning that engages if I cross over a lane divider without signaling first, which plays two short beeps and applies some force to the steering wheel. But easy enough to override if I continue applying force, and most of the time it’s my fault for not signaling properly anyway.<p>Doors do automatically lock themselves again after a while, but it’s nowhere close to 15 seconds like in the article. It’s maybe happened once or twice and no big deal to unlock again. On the other hand there have been times when I have unlocked my car because I wanted to grab something, and then got distracted and never actually visited it. In these cases I’m glad to have it lock itself again vs. remaining unlocked for several hours.<p>My car does play a chime at startup, but it’s not unpleasant, and I’m so used to my now that I have stopped noticing it.<p>I don&#x27;t have tire pressure sensors - but my mother had a car with this feature many years ago and they were indeed prone to false alarms. She took it to the dealer several times to fix it, and the dealer pretty much acknowleged that they were garbage. Not sure if she ever got it fixed permanently or just learned to ignore it.<p>Anyway - I know that a lot of this stuff varies by manufacturer and model, so I’m not saying my experience is universal. But for anyone asking who actually appreciates this stuff - I do. Staying safe is really important to me, and whatever annoyance the safety systems in my car cause is easily offset by their benefit. I certainly wouldn’t want to go back in time to before safety assistance features existed.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38110663" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38110663" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">janandonly</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104656">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38110659">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38110663">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38110663">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m a long time Toyota driver.

I mean, even if they press the start button, then the car won&#x27;t start unless you&#x27;ve also pressed the brake pedal?<p>&quot;Tell me you don&#x27;t have kids without telling me you don&#x27;t have kids.&quot; But seriously, this happens all the time - I am taking something out of the trunk or taking the baby out of the rear seat, meanwhile my toddler jumps into the driver&#x27;s seat to play around with the steering wheel. 20% of the times he does that, he&#x27;s gonna hit the big blue start button. I hear it because I am right outside the car, and it matters because this turns on the electrical system so leaving it that way will drain the battery.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Really, the constant beeping and maniacally locking the doors all the time is ridiculous.<p>You can turn most of that off, and if you&#x27;re doing normal things like starting the car the right way, you never hear them. EG, I <i>only</i> hear that beep when the toddler does his thing or on the <i>very</i> rare occasions when I intentionally turn on the electrical system w&#x2F;o starting the engine.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Also, can anyone explain why in the US if I click unlock on the remote, it just unlocks the front door?<p>Sure. I relate to this use-case less personally but it&#x27;s a safety feature for when you&#x27;re parked somewhere desolate and dark. The idea is that by unlocking only the driver door, you create less room for someone to jump into the car from the other doors and carjack you. Like I said, not something I encounter but I suppose it got created for a reason.<p>It&#x27;s also a thing you can turn off. Here&#x27;s the instructions for Toyota[1]. It&#x27;s also obviously a muscle memory for cars you own, where you press once or twice depending on which doors you want to open.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Really, the author of the article is 100% correct. The UX on most new mid-range cars is ridiculously bad<p>The author reports a couple of things that sound like straight up BUGS and I pointed those out as things he should really talk to a dealer about because they are so dumb that it might just be his car specifically. The rest of them and the ones you listed - are very reasonable features and sane defaults as I described. You may not be used to them in rental cars and obviously you aren&#x27;t going to fiddle with the settings in those cars, but if this was your car you&#x27;d either turn them off, adjust your style to match the device (ie - what ARE you doing that you&#x27;re getting that beeping all the time?) or maybe your life will evolve to a place where you appreciate some of these kid-focused features more.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toyotanation.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;remote-2-press-unlock.1715498&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.toyotanation.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;remote-2-press-unlock.1...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38105382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38105382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Johnny555</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38106222">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38107587">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38105382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38105382">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And this one makes perfect sense:<p><i>But, only if you put it in neutral first, refrain from even thinking about touching the accelerator pedal, and fully depress the clutch (even though you just put it in fucking neutral)</i><p>I always put the car in neutral <i>and</i> press the clutch, before trying to start it, so wouldn&#x27;t even notice if the car enforced that... my car only enforces that the clutch be pushed down, but taking it out of gear is a good best practice for extra redundancy, for instance to protect against the case where the clutch hydraulic cylinder had a leak so the clutch didn&#x27;t fully disengage)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38107587" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38107587" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bigstrat2003</span><span>|</span><a href="#38104672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38105382">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38104777">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38107587">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38107587">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This is the one that sounds truly wrong - if your car alerts you of adjacent vehicles when it shouldn&#x27;t, (a) you can probably turn off that assist and (b) you should tell the company because it literally sounds like a bug.<p>This is the one which I empathized with, because it happens to me all the time (2022 Mazda CX-30).

The &quot;D&quot; mode mimics an automatic ICE car--it creeps forward when one lets off the brake, and coasts for a long time when one lets off the accelerator. I always drive the car in &quot;L&quot; mode, which is the aggressive regenerative braking mode. When I let off the gas it slows to a stop quickly (assuming the battery is not near full charge). And it does not creep when I release the brake.<p>But there is one bizarre exception: If I power on the car and put it in &quot;L&quot; mode, but I haven&#x27;t yet fastened my seat belt, the car will creep forward when I let off the brake, just like in D. This has caught me off guard a few times, but I&#x27;ve always caught it and hit the brakes before the car rolled into my garage door or a car parked in front of me.<p>I once brought it up on &#x2F;r&#x2F;BoltEV, and someone claiming to be a Chevrolet engineer told me this behavior was by design, but had no good justification for it.</div><br/><div id="38110421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38110421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">evilaubergine</span><span>|</span><a href="#38105584">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38107099">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38110421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38110421">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The reason is for safety (so people don&#x27;t get out of their car while it&#x27;s halted in L without the parking brake), this did cause me to (slowly) crash once, I am sure people have been nearly injured by the safety feature.<p>I later replaced my Bolt with a Tesla Model 3 (yeah, I have a lot of complaints here too, but overall it&#x27;s less annoying) purely for fast-charging reasons, but driving a Bolt again afterwards drove me absolutely insane with their L mode:<p><pre><code>  - have to enable it each drive

I know it&#x27;s not the top of anybody else&#x27;s demands from a car, but what the fuck Chevrolet. There should always be a button for &quot;I didn&#x27;t buy an EV by accident, now let me fucking drive it normally&quot;.<p>The truth is Chevrolet never intended to allow you to use L mode to drive at all. They only added it in, so you can put on the parking brake, and tap down the gear selector repeatedly to switch between L and D, making your car bounce up and down.

It’s has to be a Kia. And this brings me to the issue of auto testers on magazines or YouTube&#x2F;TV. They tend to list all the features a car has to compare that to other cars to determine where you get more bang for your buck. But they never actually how well all these systems are integrated together. And if they do then the comparison is missing so one one wonders what other manufacturers do this better.  I drove a Kia Sportage from 2014 and this was one of the last models without all them assistant features   The car was very good but I could still feel that most things where hacked together and not well integrated.<p>My current car has a lot of these new features and works actually great.

Tire pressure increases slightly when driving due to heat. They have never triggered a warning.<p>- I don&#x27;t recall ever having to accept terms of service.

No controls are via touch screen (touchscreen has information and setting like blind spot, but not actual controls that don&#x27;t have physical buttons).<p>I also have a 1990s vehicle, with an aftermarket touchscreen installed to support Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

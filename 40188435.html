What many don&#x27;t realize is that the true challenge of communication is not one of transmission, but clarity of thought and understanding. Any tool, software language, or AI coder will still be limited by the clarity and completeness of the specs presented. What is software after all but complete and precise specs? Nothing will ever turn your fuzzy intent into your clear best interest. If you don&#x27;t have clarity of thought, no intelligence in the world can help you.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I disagree with the author, I agree that more complex creative power will be accessible to a greater number of people, but I think the intrinsic efficiency limit of communication will always be more difficult than people think.</div><br/><div id="40207742" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40207742" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">var_cw</span><span>|</span><a href="#40207088">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207397">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40207742">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40207742">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Software has been and always will be fundamentally a problem of communication.<p>its a problem of communication with a system. that system can be a human, a group of humans, some esoteric knowledge graph, internet or even a single webpage. i believe the author here is focusing on generative UIs from a software developer standpoint. this is just one form of interaction&#x2F;communication and could be wrong to be generalized across scenarios.<p>i have been thinking about highly lossless and efficient forms of communication between a human and a system. keep converging to voice agents where if they feel alot human(something similar to the hume demo) then it can be the default mode of how a human interacts with a system. again, this will be a specific setting and sounds more consumer-ish. a clear contrast to what the author intends to write.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40207397" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40207397" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sublinear</span><span>|</span><a href="#40207088">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207742">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207126">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40207397">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40207397">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The same points you made make me wonder if end users even want to modify or write a program.<p>Even if it&#x27;s possible, it&#x27;s still a lot of work.

A lot of software used to be somewhat malleable [1]. But that got removed, because it wasn&#x27;t A&#x2F;B testable or it wasn&#x27;t the most easy implementation thinkable. Those two points are not changed by LLMs. Therefore, I doubt we will see a resurgence of malleable or at least configurable and scriptable software. Although, I would love to see it. Even those small features to adapt the application to your style of working instead of the other way around was extremely useful, imho.<p>[1] There was a time, when it was considered a standard feature of a UI that you could change keyboard shortcuts and toolbars. MacOS and Mac OS X even had an API that end users could use to script across multiple applications. Amiga OS had something similar based on the language Rexx.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40207539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40207539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hayley-patton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40207088">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207397">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40208019">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207126">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40207539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40207539">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The typical consumer isn&#x27;t empowered to modify or write a program, so why would they entertain the idea?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40207126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40207126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">greenavocado</span><span>|</span><a href="#40207088">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40207397">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40207126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40207126">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agree.

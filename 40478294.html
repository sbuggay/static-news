Wind is not that. The structural and installation requirements result in relatively high fixed costs. To offset that you need to scale the size of the turbine, and maximise the time they spend spinning. You can only go so big on buildings and the built environment reduces your capacity factor because there&#x27;s loads of buildings blocking the wind.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40480066" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40480066" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#40479020">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40480660">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40479250">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40480066">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40480066">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When we talk about solar it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you want to generate 100w, 100kw or 1mw. You&#x27;re pretty much using the same tech, and the pre-requisite is simple &quot;sunshine&quot;.<p>But wind is more complex. If you want to generate a lot, then you need space (to build a tower), height (higher is better) and size (bigger is MUCH better.) And wind.<p>But if you just need a little, say 3kw, then you&#x27;re not looking for the best possible outcome, you&#x27;re looking for local outcome.<p>Most of us are location bound. I want to generate energy here - because I use it here. There are constraints (noise, size, height etc.) that I live with.<p>Sure, I&#x27;ve got solar, my roof is full of that. Let&#x27;s stipulate that economically I&#x27;m better off adding more solar. Let&#x27;s also stipulate that my roof is &quot;full&quot;.<p>I get quite a few windy days (and windy nights) a year. If I harvest 1kw&#x2F;h, I&#x27;d be happy. If I generate excess I can sell it to the grid.<p>The obvious answer is still a 3 or 5 bladed conventional wind turbine. But that is both visual, and can be noisy.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t need it to compete economicly with solar. I don&#x27;t need it to be &quot;perfect wind efficient&quot;. All I need is around 3kw capacity (for 1kw output) in a residential friendly package.<p>Solar has shown that individuals are prepared to spend capital on residential generation.

A group at Clarkson has been working on this. They have a wind tunnel, so they can get solid data. [1] They have a simple duct around a standard wind turbine. This gives the effect of more intake area, and they get almost twice the output power. Unclear if this is cheaper than just increasing the blade length.<p>Many people have been down this road. There are many, many variants on experimental ducted wind turbines. Just search for &quot;ducted wind turbine&quot;. There are very few installations.

Insurance companies would love for every policy to be profitable, but if we let it go that far, it&#x27;s merely a savings account with negative interest rates. At another level, insurance is about analyzing risk and making it more expensive to take bigger risks. Where do we want the tradeoff between these things? Whatever we choose, we have to have some ability to predict &#x2F; evaluate risk.<p>In the face of climate change, places that have been safe for a very long time are becoming unsafe. But I don&#x27;t see a reason these shifts won&#x27;t happen over and over as climate change unfolds. It might be worse than mass migrations... migrations to locations which later become dangerous, turning into recurring mass migrations.<p>How well can we predict where it will be safe in the coming decades and where it won&#x27;t. Coastal land at or below current sea level (plus storm surge) is fairly predictable, especially where there isn&#x27;t the population density (and money) to support building sea walls. But with things like rivers changing course (e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alsek_River" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alsek_River</a>), it might become very difficult to predict what&#x27;s going to be safe down the road. Today we talk about things like 100-year flood plains, but how will we establish flood probabilities when the river that might flood in 10 or 20 years doesn&#x27;t even exist today?<p>Are the people who get unlucky with predictions just screwed because their home equity is gone?

Once a fire gets going, it grows and can destroy any neighborhood.<p>Call me crazy but if I was the mayor of LA I’d make them invest heavily in PREVENTION.

It would use AI at the edge to flag every fire immediately and alert nearest authorities, and otherwise delete footage. There may be other AI at the edge uses added later by the regulators but I’d work to put in place heavy bars to overcome (eg 70% in a public referendum) before they are added.<p>I would also invest heavily in mobile firefighting tools and materials.

Key point in time was invention of printing press combined with lutheran zeal to read and the western alphabet that allowed unprecedented platform for knowledge transfer. After that it&#x27;s been pure acceleration.<p>Before literacy was a major thing (which it has not been historically) knowledge transfer and preservation was based on human to human contact. You could not literally just crank the machine to print out out going edges in a knowledge graph.<p>I&#x27;m not meaning just a few literate people. I mean an entire society capable of reading and eager to create and learn new information.<p>&gt; Technology is just tools that humans make to solve a problem.<p>According to a dictionary it&#x27;s &quot;the branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences&quot; &#x2F; &quot;the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry&quot; and I would argue it&#x27;s this sort of technology that enables novel, rapid adaptation.<p>Applied sciences need science before application. Now - knowledge seeking that sure looks likes science even though it was not called that has been around few millenia - Thales of Miletus, Ibn al-Haytham etc etc.<p>What is novel in our time is application of science <i>to every goddamn problem</i> on an industrial scale. And the understanding that things can improve. This requires a literate society (imo but arguable maybe), eager to adapt, and pragmatic recognition of what works and what does not.<p>There are areas that are lacking in literacy and capital. While people in those areas sure enough are able as anybody else to individually use technology developed and manufactured elsewhere, the societies in which they live simply lack the means to apply industrial level technological innovations.<p>With industrial level technology adaptation it&#x27;s a whole different ballgame.<p>Many places in US would be uninhabitable without technology and are thus testaments to the idea that MODERN technology allows survival in unprecedented places. For example Colorado. The place was so arid and unhospitable no one could or would want to live there. But then there came railroads, industrial engineering to implement water reservoirs etc etc and visit Denver today and it&#x27;s very hard for an outsider to realize they are visiting a modern goddamn miracle.<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure if people can live in Colorado they can live anywhere given sufficient capital is applied (capital being the enabler of applied science and technology).</div><br/><div id="42734519" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42734519" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">forgotoldacc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733229">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734367">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42734519">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42734519">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of ancient societies rapidly adapted to problems. In my previously mentioned tsunami example, ancient societies would build their towns above a certain point to be safe from them. Some cultures used to (and some poorer people still do) build houses on stilts near flood areas to stay safe from rising water.<p>But in modern, literate society, people think &quot;nah it&#x27;ll be fine bro&quot; and build houses right up on and flat against the coastline. Then entire towns get washed away.<p>The biggest mistake modern people make is assuming ancient societies were stupid. They didn&#x27;t have people sitting in offices thinking up solutions to problems. But the reality is those societies learned just as quickly as anyone else did, and a lot of them probably had a much stronger fear of nature and didn&#x27;t sit around thinking &quot;nah bro we&#x27;ll totally survive. we have technology&quot;. They knew a tiny mistake meant death. Death to modern first worlders seems like a very out of reach thing. We operate on the assumption we&#x27;ll live long lives and die in a retirement home.<p>And Colorado isn&#x27;t by any means inhospitable. There were plenty of tribes in Colorado before literate enlightened megagenius westerners came along to save the day. It has some of the oldest known towns on the North American continent.[1] Westerners may have at first struggled to survive there with their modern technology, but natives lived just fine in Colorado for thousands of years.<p>Tibet is a far more inhospitable place. So is Saudi Arabia. But those also have thousands of years of history all without a printing press. Arabian culture even managed to spread across the world out from the inhospitable desert and even dominate part of Europe before the printing press existed. Spain and Indonesia became Islamic before enlightened Europeans went out to save the world and make it &quot;habitable&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mesa_Verde_National_Park" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mesa_Verde_National_Park</a></div><br/><div id="42734853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42734853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsloth</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733229">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734519">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42734853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42734853">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree humans as individuals regadless where they came from or when they lived have always been equally precious in potential, and all traditions are valuable, but it’s simply false narrative to claim modern technology &amp; capital would not make a difference.<p>My point was it’s false narrative to compare any historical society to a modern industrial one.<p>Printing press, latin alphabet and market economy were suberb for knowledge transfer.

1. Global scale monoculture in knowledge (take engineers from US midwest, Ethiopia, China, Brazil, France, Japan, Finland, Chennai - we all basically can mesh instantly to a product team since tehcnological education is so homogenous). This monoculture was enabled by the printing press and later digital technologies.
2. Insane amount of energy per capita available
3. Amount of capital available including finance<p>2. and 3. simply were not available before. We can argue all day about merits of education systems of old but you simply did not have this global talent mass on hand. This talent mass is prerequisite so that you can scale capital and technology rapidly on a global scale.<p>Energy&amp;Capital then feed the machine to give it energy. This machine simply did not exist before. The energy per person in any society was tiny fraction what we can utilize. Similarly for capital.<p>Japan is excellent example.<p>a) It demonstrates how long it takes for a society, if it&#x27;s educated and all around excellent <i>but pre-modern</i> to reach parity with modern societies. I would argue based on facts it&#x27;s about two generations or 50 years (for Japan) from Perry expedition 1850&#x27;s to Japan wiping a western industrial nation state fleet to the bottom of the Tsushima straits (1905).<p>b) It demonstrates this society, when in it&#x27;s pre-modern configuration lacked things, that it felt necesary to acquire to be able to go head-to-head with societies that had these implemented.<p>It&#x27;s this difference between pre-modern,pre-capitalist pre-industrial and modern I&#x27;m talking about, why it&#x27;s false narrative to state &quot;people througout history have been smart and able&quot; as a contradiction why modern societies would be more capable. Because they are. It&#x27;s not a statement about why some people with different upbringing or genes would be different. That&#x27;s irrelevant (except up to a point where their upbringing relates to prevalent institutions i.e Acemoglu, &quot;Why nations fail&quot; etc).<p>I agree we know nothing of <i>how long</i> the current system can last, or will it evolve or devolve. But it&#x27;s very hard for me to imagine the system going away unless we go full mad max. Because it&#x27;s not about cultural identity anymore. Who is your king or god. While we live in tumultuous times, Fukuyama was still more or less correct IMO, even though clearly it&#x27;s not a &quot;end of history&quot; as much as &quot;beginning of new history&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s about capital, energy, education and markets.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42734191" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42734191" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sabinus</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733229">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734068">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734110">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734515">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42734191">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42734191">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Technology can&#x27;t save you from famines when there isn&#x27;t enough sunlight to grow crops for a season or two.

My worry is that while extreme, their logic and priorities do not feel unique for government decision making. The last thing I&#x27;d want to do is expand it.<p>When you distort risk pricing, you distort the market, and if you do it hard enough for long enough, you are basically pulling back the slingshot.<p>While this also applies to mutual insurers, my philosophy is being serious about solvency is the best way to know if you are properly underwriting and pricing.  
I feel like the government operates too much knowing that they can backstop it either themselves or by imposing an assessment on the market.<p>You are right that the really big disasters are very correlated events. While not a silver bullet, reinsurance and other risk transfer stuff can help smooth those kind of events out. The good-ish thing with those risks is that while they are uncertain, they are sort of identifiable, known unknowns in Rumsfeld parlance.<p>I agree with that sentiment, the thing that always seems crazy to me is that California&#x27;s housing pricing in the face of all these things, but perhaps it&#x27;s sort of pick your poison. Like I don&#x27;t want to harp on it, but the only implicit or explicit thing everyone appears to agree on given the decisions that have been made is protecting housing prices above all else.

That can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars (which shows up as now only being able to afford a much worse house, probably in a much worse location, if you can continue to afford to own at all), and  you are basically gifting that money to the bank by paying off your loan early.<p>You can understand why such people would be willing to take a chance on not having insurance rather than incur a definite loss, and why it might be tempting to try to come up with some other solution than just unleashing the unrelenting might of the free market on them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42733447" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42733447" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TheOtherHobbes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733231">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42733504">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42733438">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42733447">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42733447">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is not an insurance problem, or a market problem, or an MBA econ problem.<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;Do we want cultural extinction or a relatively comfortable and habitable planet?&quot; problem, which is not quite the same thing.<p>No amount of faith-based &quot;We will adapt!&quot; is going to make an impression until evidence appears that we are actually adapting in real, tangible ways.<p>Clearly, objectively, and empirically we are not.

As this video points out you have these forces in play:<p>1. The state who sets insurance price caps for political expediency, basically to increase house prices (because they&#x27;d go down if insurance prices could float freely). BTW we have examples of areas that are uninsurable like the Florida Keys;<p>2. The homeowners who want their house prices to go up and want to pay as little as possible for home insurance; and<p>3. Insurance companies who can&#x27;t write too many policies so they remain solvent. Price caps ultimately lead to insurers leaving the market.<p>LA in particular has competing problems: wildfires and earthquakes. If you want to avoid total loss due to wildfires, first you wouldn&#x27;t build in Pacific Palisades at all. It&#x27;s a vegetation rich area between hills with potentially high winds. If you want to avoid fire loss, you would build out of concrete not timber-framed buildings.<p>But the problem is that earthquakes have the opposite building priorities. Lumber is actually quite good in earthquake zones because you tend to get less loss of life from the collapse of timber houses.<p>Now you can build concrete houses that are earthquake-resistant (eg in Japan) but it&#x27;s expensive.<p>Ultimately all of this comes down to a malaise brought on by high house prices. Voters consistently vote for policies that increase their house prices with absolutely no concern for the externalities.<p>If it now costs $1 million to build an &quot;average&quot; house, then you&#x27;re going to be spending $20,000+ a year on insurance. If your house only cost $100,000, you wouldn&#x27;t have that problem.<p>It&#x27;s even worse in California because a lot of property taxes are capped so the state government can&#x27;t even recoupe taxes from a lot of high-priced property but they suffer the costs of it (eg by being the insurer of last resort).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;ZT2Jek6a6&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tiktok.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;ZT2Jek6a6&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="42733416" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42733416" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amazingamazing</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733393">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734220">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42733416">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42733416">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">a lot of this here is really what the problem is. for whatever reason, california wants to try to micromanage this particular microeconomy (insurance), but it will fail.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42734220" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42734220" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nullc</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733393">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42733416">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734130">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42734220">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42734220">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Now you can build concrete houses that are earthquake-resistant (eg in Japan) but it&#x27;s expensive.<p>It&#x27;s expensive here, but is it expensive in Japan?

In Oakland, for example, fires of various size and ignition occurred in 1923, 1931, 1933, 1937, 1946, 1955, 1960, 1961, 1968, 1970, 1980, 1990, 1991, 1995, 2002, and 2008. 
<i>Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and Los Angeles County are other examples.</i> Orange and San Bernardino counties share a border that runs north to south through the Chino Hills State Park, with the park&#x27;s landscape ranging from large green coastal sage scrub, grassland, and woodland, to areas of brown sparsely dense vegetation made drier by droughts or hot summers. The valley&#x27;s grass and barren land can become easily susceptible to dry spells and drought, therefore making it a prime spot for brush fires and conflagrations, many of which have occurred since 1914. Hills and canyons have seen brush or wildfires in 1914, the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and into today.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_California_wildfires" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_California_wildfires</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42733408" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42733408" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">x0x0</span><span>|</span><a href="#42733349">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42733530">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42734318">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42733408">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42733408">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>The risks of drought and the resulting fire or hurricanes and floods is much higher than it has been in recorded history in these areas because of climate change</i><p>I saw an article on npr [1] which basically agrees with the chart on the blogpost.

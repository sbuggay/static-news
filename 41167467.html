History and evolution are ongoing things. They aren’t “done” and in the past. Today, right now, people use food as an important part of their culture, whether that be immigrant parents teaching their kids recipes from their home culture, a brother making food for his dying sibling (as in the link), or two friends having dinner.<p>And that’s only on the consumption side - not to mention the entire production industrial complex that employs millions of people globally to make and prepare food - and has done so for thousands of years. “Food gatherer and preparer&quot; probably has a claim to being the oldest profession. Food is so ingrained in human history and culture it’s basically impossible to imagine civilization without it. Which was my point about it being a human thing.<p>2. Your mention of religion is actually helpful too, because I think a similar attitude is prevalent when discussing religious beliefs: “That was a historical thing and it doesn’t have much effect on anything today.”<p>Which is very much <i>not</i> the case; everything in the contemporary world has been shaped by religious beliefs, from the concept of the Self, individualism, the structure of political systems, democracy, universalism, on and on. Modernity is in no way a fresh beginning or clean slate in which the past doesn’t apply. That doesn’t mean you need to believe in XYZ religion today, but to deny that it has any contemporary relevance is just incorrect.<p>3. On the evolutionary front, the fact is that you evolved to eat in a group - the possibility of someone sitting alone eating a meal made by others basically didn’t exist until a century ago. So it formed who you are today, whether you like it or not.<p>4. Personally, I like to cook alone. It requires a focused approach that prevents you from scrolling TikTok or being distracted by innumerable other things. I also like to cook foods that remind me of my origins – for example, I like making pierogi, as I&#x27;m Polish and from the region where a certain type of pierogi are from. I make them using the rolling pin that was my late Polish grandma&#x27;s, which also makes it a special experience. Food culture doesn&#x27;t need to a social thing at all.<p>I don’t want to assume what your opinion is but it seems to be something like, &quot;None of that matters, all that matters is that it tastes good, comes in ready-to-eat packaging, and can be eaten alone.&quot;<p>Which seems to me like the most depressing, reductive approach possible to something with so much cultural significance and history. Do you think the same thing about art or architecture? Literature? Films?<p>This being HN; I’m gonna guess you’re a technical person, and so you might gain more of an appreciation for food by watching some YouTube videos on chefs working. The skill and craftsmanship can be truly impressive.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41168048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41168048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">katzenversteher</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167791">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167917">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167874">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41168048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41168048">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I understand your point but I believe McDonalds and the likes are worse.

The body is an essential part of our being, and does not lose that aspect of our being after death. Cremation was previously only practiced by cultures that believed in a split reality—for example, the Norse pagans and Valhalla.<p>As Christians, we all believe in the bodily general resurrection and heaven being in &quot;the same place&quot; as we are now (assuming all Christians believe in one of the two forms of the Nicene creed).<p>Working from there, burial seems more appropriate.</div><br/><div id="41168438" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41168438" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#41167649">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41167905">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41168438">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41168438">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; assuming all Christians believe in one of the two forms of the Nicene creed<p>I guess this is where we part ways somewhat—I&#x27;m a devout Christian who does not accept the output of the First Council of Nicea as authoritative.

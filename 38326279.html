It was 1962 and John Glenn had just orbited the earth three times.   My dad&#x27;s brother paid his yearly visit to Detroit around the time of my tenth birthday and he brought me a present.  It was a crystal radio in the shape of Glenn&#x27;s capsule.<p>I remember eagerly hooking up the ground to the radiator and sitting on the bottom steps to the second floor.  The joy I had in bringing signals out of the air.  I kept a notebook on all the different stations and their call letters.<p>That led pretty directly to getting my amateur radio license four years later.  A dozen years later I bought a HP programmable calculator and taught it how to do tasks at the business I then managed.  Storage was a magnetic strip you fed into the machine.<p>Still later at another business I took my new business computer and taught myself to learn Lotus 123.  That led in a straight line to dBase II and quickly a host of other languages.  Another ten years it led to a new career as an entrepreneur leading to present day.<p>Most people if they look back there was a spark that led to a lifetime interest in something whether it be a hobby or a career.  I told both my nieces before they headed off to university to take advantage of your time to try different things, if only a single time.  I have a friend who tried scuba diving and that led to him owning his own diving shop.  A buddy joined the bicycle club and met his wife.</div><br/><div id="38344715" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38344715" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jstanley</span><span>|</span><a href="#38343007">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38344846">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38344715">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38344715">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Crazy how people&#x27;s experiences can be so different.<p>I tried making crystal radios 5 or 6 times in my life (one of which from a kit) and never heard a thing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38344846" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38344846" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MichaelRo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38343007">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38342062">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38344846">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38344846">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well as a kid in the 80s I lived in a village whose link to the outside world was 15Km of wire over the hills hooking a device like this ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cristoiublog.ro&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;telefon-cu-manivela-250x200.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cristoiublog.ro&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;telef...</a> ) to the manual telephone exchange. After picking up the phone from the handle I&#x27;d rotate the crank vigurously until the telephone lady looking like this ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;DMMuSrLXkAAzvXA?format=jpg&amp;name=small" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;DMMuSrLXkAAzvXA?format=jpg&amp;name=...</a> ) would pick up and ask where to connect me to.<p>So radio looked a bit miraculous to me, I tried to understand how it works on a deeper level, engineering level. There were kits to buy and solder but I never felt satisfied with that, it didn&#x27;t &quot;do it for me&quot;. OK, I hooked these things up but still have no idea how or why they work. In a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; analogy it&#x27;s the difference between operating the ring (any idiot can do that) and building the ring (only a true wizard knows how). So this set me on a path where I made efforts to learn applied mathematics which can be used to explain these electronic circuits, eventually went to Techical University and finally fucking figured out the magic. I can now design a radio oscillator and modulator and amplifier and demodulator from the ground up, at differential equations level. Which ... after solving the issue of &quot;understand radio&quot;, left me with the realization that I can&#x27;t make a living out of that. So I pivoted to software development, taking advantage of my higher than usual level of knowledge in mathematics by eventually getting into finance as a quant developer.<p>So radio kinda got me into stock exchanges.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38342062" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38342062" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">geerlingguy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38344846">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38342357">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38342062">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38342062">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For anyone wondering how you could pull enough energy out of thin air to get one of these to produce sound... my Dad and I just toured a 50kW clear channel AM radio transmitter site outside St. Louis[1], and it makes more sense when you see how much power is being pumped into that tower!<p>The coils that tune the tower vibrate enough from the RF they reproduce the sound too.

He grew up in a country town (now outer suburb) near Melbourne, Australia, so was a bit isolated and yearning to feel connected to the world.  That led to a decade working for Australia&#x27;s major telco (now Telstra, then PMG&#x2F;Telecom) researching and building wireless networks, then 40 years running his own company that produced all kinds of different products using microprocessors for monitoring and control&#x2F;automation.<p>I realised that this very much mirrored my own pathway into my career: I immediately dived into the web as soon as it was available in the mid 90s as a way of finding content and communities I was interested in, and for the thrill of being connected to the world, which then led to learning web development and software development and pursuing a career that&#x27;s now been going for 25 years, doing all kinds of different things, but all of it on the web&#x2F;internet (and to bring it full circle, for the past few years I worked with my father to make his devices internet-enabled and turn them into IoT products).</div><br/></div></div><div id="38341631" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38341631" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smackeyacky</span><span>|</span><a href="#38342234">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38341528">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38341631">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38341631">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the Mattel toys in the Bionic Man line of toys had a crystal radio built into a backpack - a small earpiece and a little dial to tune it.<p>No batteries in it.

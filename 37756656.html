Look at the AES competition<p>Often, yes. But also consider the SHA-3 competition.<p>BLAKE2 seems more widely used than what was chosen for SHA-3 (Keccak). What was submitted for the SHA-3 competition was BLAKE1 (it didn&#x27;t have a number back then but I think this is clearer) so it&#x27;s not like NIST said that Keccak is better than BLAKE2, they only said it&#x27;s better than BLAKE1 (per their requirements, which are unlikely to align with your requirements because of the heavy weighing of speed-in-hardware), but still this is an example of a widely used algorithm that is not standardized.<p>&gt; how often do you see Serpent being mentioned, despite it having a larger security margin than Rijndael<p>The goal of an encryption algorithm is not only to be secure. Sure, that has to be a given: nobody is going to use a broken algorithm when given a choice. But when you have two secure options, the more efficient one is the one to choose. You could use a 32k RSA key just to be sure, or a 4k RSA key which (to the best of my knowledge) everyone considers safe until quantum. (After quantum, you need something like a 1TB key, as djb humorously proposed.)<p>Wikipedia article on Serpent: &quot;The 32 rounds mean that Serpent has a higher security margin than Rijndael; however, Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small blocks.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know that nobody talks about Serpent solely because it was not chosen as winner.

I keep coming across BLAKE2 implementations, but rarely hear so much as people considering to use SHA-3 somewhere. If anyone has actual numbers on this, that would be interesting.<p>It would be good if SHA-3 is being used because then chip makers have a reason to bake it into their hardware, which is exactly where the biggest gain over SHA-2 is expected. If that happens, and all else being equal (no cracks appear in Keccak), I&#x27;d be surprised if BLAKE2 remains as popular!<p>&gt; you don&#x27;t know a priori how large of a security margin you need<p>True, so this can be argued to be an educated guess at first. But then confidence increases over time. It seems to be expected that, more than 20 years later, people aren&#x27;t considering Serpent anymore. Is it because it wasn&#x27;t chosen as AES? Certainly partially, but BLAKE2 (I&#x27;ll admit it does seem like an outlier) likely will still be talked about in the future so standardization is not the only factor.<p>I didn&#x27;t see actual benchmarks, but Serpent sounds at least three times slower than Rijndael for, by now, no tangible benefit. What would be interesting is if there were AES competitors that are also fully unbroken and are more efficient than Rijndael, or easier to implement, etc.</div><br/><div id="37761658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37761658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">EGreg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37757935">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759706">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37761658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37761658">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish chip makers would bake the elliptic curve used in Bitcoin and Ethereum (secp256k) as well, instead of  the entire industry coalescing around secp256r, which many suspect was somehow weaker (since its parameters are some weird large number X instead of a hard-to-game number like 15, leading some to believe that the first X-1 candidates were tried and X was found to be weaker).<p>The real reason I would have liked that to be the case is so that one could use WebAuthn and Subtle Web Crypto to sign things and have the blockchain natively verify the signature.<p>As it is, I am hoping that EVM will roll out a precompiled signature verifier for secp256r, which is on the roadmap — they say!</div><br/><div id="37761913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37761913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">arjvik</span><span>|</span><a href="#37757935">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37761658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759509">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37761913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37761913">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There are a few different on-chain implementations of secp256r1 signature verification for use with passkeys, my favorite of which is demoed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p256.alembic.tech" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p256.alembic.tech</a><p>Work is also being done on SNARK-based cross-curve signature verification<p>But I fully agree, especially with the growing popularity of account abstraction, the EVM desperately needs a secp256r1 precompile!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37759509" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37759509" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adastra22</span><span>|</span><a href="#37757935">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759084">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759360">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758968">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37759509">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37759509">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">SHA-3 is vastly more widely used than BLAKE.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37758968" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37758968" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zahllos</span><span>|</span><a href="#37757935">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759084">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759773">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37758968">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37758968">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I fully admit to having a weak spot for Serpent - it is self-bitslicing (see the submission package or the linux kernel tree), which in hindsight makes constant time software easier to write, and it was faster in hardware even when measured at the time, which is where we have ended up putting AES anyway (e.g. AES-NI etc).<p>BUT.

It is also true that cryptanalytic attacks appear to fare slightly better against AES than Serpent. What does this mean? A brute force attack has the same number of operations as the claimed security level, say, 2^128 for 128-bit. An attack is something better than this: fewer operations. All of the attacks we know about achieve slightly less than this security level - which is nonetheless still impossible to do - but that comes at a cost: they need an infeasible amount of memory. In terms of numbers: 9000 TB to reduce 2^128 to 2^126 against full-round AES according to a quick check of wikipedia. For reference, the lightweight crypto competition considered 2^112 to be sufficient margin. 2^126 is still impossible.<p>In practice, the difference between Serpent and AES in terms of cryptanalytic security is meaningless. It is not an example of NIST picking a weaker algorithm deliberately, or I would argue, even unintentionally. It (AES) was faster when implemented in software for the 32-bit world that seemed to be the PC market at the time.</div><br/><div id="37759180" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37759180" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kpdemetriou</span><span>|</span><a href="#37757935">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37758968">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37759734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37759180">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37759180">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Implemented correctly, I agree the difference in security margin may not be too important.

Then in 1989 white hats &quot;discovered&quot; differential cryptography, and realized that the changes that were made to the algorithm actually protected it from a then-unknown (to the general public) cryptographic attack. Differential cryptography worked beautifully on some other popular cryptosystems of the era, e.g. the FEAL-4 cipher could be broken with just 8 plaintext examples, while DES offered protection up to 2^47 chosen plaintexts.<p>The actual way that the NSA had tried to limit DES was to cap its key length at 48 bits, figuring that their advantage in computing power would let them brute force it when no one else could. (NIST compromised between the NSA&#x27;s desire for 48 and the rest of the world&#x27;s desire for 64, which was why DES had the always bizarre 56 bit key.)

If the US wanted to make the world completely trust and embrace subtly-broken cryptography, a pretty solid way to do that would be to make competition where a whole bunch of great, independent teams of cryptography researchers can submit their algorithms, then have a team of excellent NSA cryptographers analyze them and pick an algorithm with a subtle flaw that others haven&#x27;t discovered. Alternatively, NIST or the NSA would just to plant one person on one of the teams, and I&#x27;m sure they could figure out some clever way to subtly break their team&#x27;s algorithm in a way that&#x27;s really hard to notice. With the first option, no participant in the competition has to that there&#x27;s any foul play.

I&#x27;m just saying that, to me, it doesn&#x27;t seem impossible for the NIST to ensure that the winner of their cryptography contests is an algorithm that&#x27;s subtly broken.

In a competition where the US has no official influence over the result, there has to be a huge conspiracy to affect which algorithm is chosen.

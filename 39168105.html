It reminds me a lot of politics and I&#x27;m not sure why we&#x27;re so resistant to nuance when our whole job is typically composed of nuance.<p>Though I&#x27;ll point out, I think it is natural to complain about your juggling dog dropping balls or making mistakes on your taxes. That doesn&#x27;t mean you aren&#x27;t impressed. I think this response is increasingly common considering these dogs are sold as if they are super-human at these tasks. That&#x27;s quite disappointing and our satisfaction is generally relative to expectations, not actual utility. If you think something is shit and it turns out to be just okay, you&#x27;re happy and feel like you got a bargain. If you&#x27;re expecting something to be great but it turns out to be just okay, you&#x27;re upset and feel cheated.

I can totally get how people who don&#x27;t work with these tools don&#x27;t understand the nuances, but it confuses me with experts.

(This isn&#x27;t a dis on that style, lots of work is repetitive and redundant).<p>So I changed how I use GPT (which I do through API. Much cheaper btw). I use it a lot like how I would use SO in the first place. Get outlines, understand how certain lines might work (noisy process here), generate generic chunks of code especially from modules I&#x27;m unfamiliar with. A lot of this can just be seen as cutting down time searching.<p>So, the most useful one: using it as a fuzzy search to figure out how to Google. This one is the most common pattern. Since everything on Google is so SEO optimized and Google clearly doesn&#x27;t give a shit, I can ask GPT a question, get a noisy response that contains useful vernacular or keywords which I can then use to refine a Google search and actually filter out a decent amount of shit. I think people might read this comment and think that you should just build a LLM into Google, but no, what&#x27;s going on is more complicated and requires the symbiosis. GPT is dumb, doesn&#x27;t have context, but is good at being a lossy compression system. The whole reason this works is because I&#x27;m intelligent and __context aware__, and importantly, critical of relying on GPT&#x27;s accuracy[0]. Much of this can&#x27;t be easily conveyed to GPT and isn&#x27;t just a matter of token length. So that said, the best way to actually improve this system is actually for Google to just get its shit together or some other search engine to replace them. Google, if you&#x27;re listening, the best way you can make Google search better with LLMs is to: 1) stop enabling SEO bullshit, 2) throw bard into the side and have the LLM talk to you to help you refine a search. Hell, you can use a RL agent for 1 to just look how many times I back out from the links you send me or look at which links I actually use. Going to page 2 is a strong signal that you served shit.<p>[0] accuracy is going to highly depend on frequency of content. While they dedupe data for training, they don&#x27;t do great semantic deduping (still an unsolved problem. Even in vision). So accuracy still depends on frequency and you can think of well known high frequency knowledge as having many different versions, or that augmentation is built in. You get lower augmentation rates with specific or niche expert knowledge as there&#x27;s little baked in augmentation and your &quot;test set&quot; is much further from the distribution of training data.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39172748" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39172748" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">balaji1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39169889">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39170273">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39172333">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39172748">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39172748">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">so its good my card that was auto-paying for the Copilot subscription expired</div><br/></div></div><div id="39172333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39172333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway2990</span><span>|</span><a href="#39169889">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39172748">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39170023">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39172333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39172333">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You cancelled the tool because you didn’t know how to use it?</div><br/></div></div><div id="39170023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39170023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teaearlgraycold</span><span>|</span><a href="#39169889">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39172333">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39170105">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39170023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39170023">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really?

My focus is primarily on developing straightforward PHP CRUD applications for addressing problems in my day-to-day job. These applications are simple, and don&#x27;t use frameworks and MVC structures, which makes the code generated by GPT-4, based on my precise instructions, easy to comprehend and usually functional right out of the prompt. I find if I listen to the users needs I can make something that addresses a pain point easily.<p>I often request modifications to code segments, typically around 25 lines, to alter the reporting features to meet specific needs, such as group X and total Y on this page. GPT-4 responds accurately to these requests. After conducting a quick QA and test, the task is complete. This approach has been transformative, particularly effective for low-complexity tasks and clear-cut directives.<p>This process reminds me of how a senior programmer might delegate: breaking down tasks into fundamental components for a junior coder to execute. In my case, GPT-4 acts as the junior programmer, providing valuable assistance at a modest cost of $20 per month. I happily pay that out of pocket to save myself time.<p>However, much like how a younger version of myself asked why we had to learn math if the calculator does it for us, I know understand why we do that. I think the same thing applies here. If you don&#x27;t know the fundamentals, you won&#x27;t be effective. If GPT-4 had been around when I learned to write PHP (don&#x27;t @ me!), I probably wouldn&#x27;t understand the fundamentals as well as I do.

I&#x27;ve found it very distracting most of the times, I don&#x27;t really understand why so many people uses this kind of assistants.<p>I find stuff like Phind useful, in the sense that sometimes something happens that I don&#x27;t understand, and 60% of the times Phind actually helps me to understand the problem. Like finding trivial bugs that I didn&#x27;t spot because I&#x27;m tired, dumb, etc.<p>On the other hand, with Codeium, I guess it may be useful when you&#x27;re just churning boilerplate code for some framework, but in my little expericence (writing scrapers and stupid data pipelines &amp; vanilla JS + HTML&#x2F;CSS) cycling through suggestions is very irritating, specially because many times it doesn&#x27;t work. Most of the times for stupid reasons, like lacking an argument or something like that, but then it&#x27;s time you have to spend debugging it.<p>Another problem I have is that I find there&#x27;s a common style of JS which consist in daisy-chaining a myriad of methods and anonymous functions, and I really struggle with this. I like to break stuff into lines, name my functions and variables, etc. And so many times code suggestions follow this style. I guess it&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been trained on.<p>Codeium is supposed to learn from this, and sometimes it does, to be fair.<p>But what I worry the most is that, If I&#x27;m a junior and I let this assistants do the code for me ¿How the hell I&#x27;m supposed to learn? Because giving Phind context + questions helps me learn or gives me direction to go on find it by myself in the internet, but if the only thing I do is press tab, I don&#x27;t know how the hell I&#x27;m supposed to learn.<p>I found a couple days ago that many people (including devs) are not using LLMs to get better but it&#x27;s just a substitute of their effort. Isn&#x27;t people afraid of this? Not because companies are going to replace you, but it&#x27;s also a self-reflection issue.<p>Coding is not the passion of my life, addmitedly, but I like it.

After a while, I started to realise that a lot of the critics don’t really understand the principle they’re criticising.<p>For example, take DRY. The important principle was never really about repeating <i>code</i>. It was about repeating <i>ideas</i>. For any given concept in your system, ideally there should be a single source of truth, and therefore a single place you need to understand or change if you’re working with that concept. It’s true that this means copying and pasting non-trivial amounts of code instead of creating a meaningful abstraction is often a bad idea. But it is also a warning that any time you do repeat an idea, you now have an ongoing liability because you need to keep those different representations in sync. That could refer to database migrations that define your schema and separate ORM class definitions, or an API you define in your back-end code and a client for that API you define in your front-end code, or a retained mode UI where you have a current value in some form field that corresponds to a specific value in your internal application state, or some invariant in your data model that can be represented in both types and unit tests.<p>People who object to combining duplicate or near-duplicate code that represents different ideas but happens to have a similar implementation at the time, on the basis that it’s a maintenance hazard for later on, aren’t wrong. They’re just objecting to a straw man that was never really the point of DRY in the first place, but has been treated as if it were due to some kind of cargo cult&#x2F;gaslighting effect.<p>The question I have now is where and when in our industry do we expect new developers to learn these principles so they do understand them properly? Some people have a formal background in CS or the like, but not everyone does, and in any case it’s not necessarily the role of an academic CS course to teach a lot of practical software development skills. I had a discussion the other day about how when I was starting out, the senior developers would give real, substantial training to the juniors to help us learn and understand these principles, but with the job-hopping culture today and the resulting general aversion to hiring juniors as a long-term investment, that just doesn’t seem to happen much any more. There are formal courses that cost a lot by personal standards but almost nothing by business standards, but there must be a tiny proportion of new developers who actually get sent on them by their employers. There are a few books worth reading, but what 20-something in 2024 wants to deal with presentation as antiquated as ink on sliced bits of tree? I suspect a lot of what today’s up and coming developers learn about these ideas comes from sources like blogs and YouTube videos, where again there is some great material out there, but as ever the problem is finding it among all the poorly understood and dubiously presented dross.<p>And then we wonder why tools come along that seem like magic, producing a dozen lines of code in a heartbeat that seem to mostly work, and young developers think they’re great even while having little idea of all the deeper things that may be wrong with that code. It’s not really surprising, and I’m not sure it’s really anyone’s fault, but it’s definitely a problem and I wish I knew what we should do about it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39169711" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39169711" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deadbabe</span><span>|</span><a href="#39169625">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39171361">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39168424">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39169711">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39169711">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">DRY is mostly bad.

When using Copilot, I felt that it tried to be too clever, and often got things wrong. It would try to write a function based on the name, and would go one of three ways: either the function was a trivial one-liner and it saved me ~2 seconds of typing after I figured out if it was correct, or it was a complex function where it cost me ~2 seconds to figure out it was waaaaay off the mark, or it saved me 30 seconds up-front by producing something that appeared correct, but that I found out 10 minutes of debugging later was actually subtly incorrect in a way that I couldn&#x27;t spot when reading quickly, but likely wouldn&#x27;t have written myself.<p>What I really want is a smarter intellisense, whereas Copilot is a dumber pair programmer.

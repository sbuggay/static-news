It’s partially because the birds avoid it since they’re not familiar with it and even the insects that they might eat don’t  like the tree so they all avoid it.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iamtravelinglight.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-dark-side-of-bohols-bilar-manmade-forest-an-appeal-to-people-planting-trees&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iamtravelinglight.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-dark-side-of-bo...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37348163" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37348163" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Lutger</span><span>|</span><a href="#37347119">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37348163">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37348163">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The concept of native plants is both highly important and deeply problematic. It is much more convoluted than how it is explained in the article. Once you start digging into it, you find out there isn&#x27;t actually a sound definition and it is rather arbitrary, maybe emotional even.<p>Some species who are introduced are, at first, considered exotic and often cause problems at the time of introduction. The successful ones are often called invasive (mostly pioneers in their native habitat). After a while, when attempts at eradication have become futile, we start to tolerate and merely try to control them a bit. This can take a long time. Then, something magical happens and suddenly we begin to consider them native plants. When, due to changing habitats, their numbers dwindle we sometimes start to care for them or even protect them. This happened with the sparrow in the Netherlands for example, which was a real pest when first introduced.<p>The most commonly cited benefit for native plants (and wildlife) is their co-evolution with other species. This makes them very beneficial to the ecosystem as sometimes hundreds of species rely on them as a source of food. It turns out that this process of co-evolution is happening a lot faster than people generally assume, and a vast array of plants that were brought from and to Europe some 200 to 400 years ago are now completely adapted. Ironically, they sometimes harbor even more relations with wildlife than the plants that have occurred in the same habitat before them, but are still considered non-native and even invasive.<p>I&#x27;d like to think of the concept of &#x27;native&#x27; as (at its best) an indirect indicator for &#x27;co-evolved&#x27; or &#x27;adapted&#x27; species, signifying its harmonious place in the ecosystem. A good yet often flawed rule of thumb in the absence of actual knowledge. However, I can&#x27;t help but think when people use the word that it is also something very cultural, something people just take for granted because someone once drew a line in the sand (time of the settlers) and after that line every newly introduced species is considered non-native. It is interesting to look more closely at this cultural construct of nativity, as it can hide a palette of more substantial values behind a thin facade of ecological benefits. Something like what people mean when they use the word tradition.</div><br/><div id="37348256" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37348256" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">totetsu</span><span>|</span><a href="#37348163">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37348256">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37348256">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This was a big rearrangement i had to make in my thinking when I first moved overseas from an island with highly isolated evolution, where &quot;native plant&quot; was very easy to understand.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37347361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CoastalCoder</span><span>|</span><a href="#37348163">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346693">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347361">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is it just me, or does that page have an overlay that makes it look like your phone&#x27;s screen protector has cracked?</div><br/><div id="37347370" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347370" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">actionfromafar</span><span>|</span><a href="#37347361">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346693">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347370">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347370">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wish it wouldn’t scroll :-)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37346693" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37346693" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pamelafox</span><span>|</span><a href="#37347361">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346846">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37346693">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37346693">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love porting my garden to native plants and just found out it&#x27;ll be featured in next year&#x27;s natives garden tour next year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bringingbackthenatives.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bringingbackthenatives.net&#x2F;</a><p>If you&#x27;re in bay area, it&#x27;s a great way to get ideas for native gardens.

Better tools and more awareness simply mean there are way more people making games. Even within large game teams you’ll also find loads of generalists.<p>The issue has never been a lack but that the industry itself crushes you into a box and insists you don’t exist. I’ve sat in meetings where generalists are described as unicorns. There is usually zero organisational impetus to utilise people’s abilities outside of their job spec. There aren’t a lack of generalists, organisations are just blind to their existence and have no understanding of how to use them.<p>As a consequence I’ve always looked for opportunities that let me be a generalist, working on prototyping teams, startups that need you to muck in and now leading a team of generalists making games. Quite a few of my team came from other industry jobs doing something specialised because of what we offered.<p>I think Tim’s diagnosis of the issue is correct for larger teams, generalists provide glue, shortcuts and important cross-cutting expertise. It’s just the actual problem is larger teams are also terrible at finding and integrating generalists because it’s anti-thetical to their working model.</div><br/><div id="37897276" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37897276" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjc50</span><span>|</span><a href="#37896849">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37896931">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37897276">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37897276">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There aren’t a lack of generalists, organizations are just blind to their existence and have no understanding of how to use them.<p>A generalist is a threat to the organization as a concept.<p>Organizations rely on power and information flowing in well defined ways.

Wait that sounds like every field doesn&#x27;t it ;)  code, art, design, sound etc.<p>The main issue is mindset, a programmer might cut short a design to save himself time, an artist might simplify the gameplay to not put in as much effort, and a musician or writer might not focus as much on the visuals because they get caught up in how it should it sound&#x2F;read etc. But they certainly can take on other roles.

And this can actually be quite successful - this happens all the time, and works out very often. In fact, this is probably where many generalists (or dual-hatters) organically arise - you get a crash course in some other area while trying to figure out a problem, and then the next time you get tapped because you already have some knowledge, and you find it kinda interesting and the next thing you know, you&#x27;re a generalist of sorts.<p>I think it&#x27;s quite true that in large projects you can&#x27;t possibly have a generalist who actually knows -everything-.

I once saw a glimpse of my boss&#x27;s notes on me on a screenshare during one of our 1on1s over Teams. The first two bullet points he has about me are something like:<p>* Generalist, has worked in many different areas on different types of software<p>* Thinks that&#x27;s a bad thing<p>And I <i>do</i> think that&#x27;s a bad thing, from a career-marketability standpoint anyway. Back in the 80s or 90s, you could get away with being a &quot;guy who knows computers&quot; and they would pretty much stick you anywhere they needed someone who knows computers. And you had to sort of muddle through, figure out what your colleagues needed to do and how to apply the technologies you had on hand to make it easier. Starting in about the 2000s, the enterprise world especially started demanding specialists. They had a J2EE application that needed maintenance and if you didn&#x27;t know your J2EE backwards and forwards, I&#x27;m sorry, there&#x27;s just no place for you, BOLIYFE[0].<p>I had spent four years in a robotics company, and then some time at a server appliance company, and the hot thing when I found myself in need of work after those stints was &quot;cloud&quot;. If you weren&#x27;t up on cloud, the industry just couldn&#x27;t use you. Résumé driven development became a must if you wanted to make a living in the industry.<p>And now those chickens have come home to roost in the gaming industry. Because game development isn&#x27;t six guys in a strip-mall office messing around, figuring out a way to create something that thrills them at least as much as Mario did. Not anymore. I&#x27;ll come out and say it: in terms of complexity, budget, and team size, games are enterprise software. Each game is an enormous project, often a distributed system, involving the contributions of hundreds. Games have passed the complexity threshold beyond which no one person can hold even a decent approximation of bigger than a tiny sliver of the whole system in their heads. The dev team is likely to be divided into smaller squads, each of which specialize in a narrow area of the game -- because it has to be. Because each of those areas, alone, is going to be more complex than can be handled by a single person, let alone a small team. And in order to not lose productivity onboarding new people, those people have to have demonstrated expertise in the narrow subset of the whole game whose team they aspire to join, typically by being credited on at least one AAA game title in that area. And generalists, unless they are literally John Carmack or at his level, don&#x27;t have the deep knowledge it takes to be useful on, say, a AAA game&#x27;s sound team, or level design team, or gameplay mechanics team, or scenario team.<p>And so we have today the situation where a Hackernews tells a promising kid, put down that homebrew retro console you built out of a Raspberry Pi and learn Unity and Unreal, because that&#x27;s where you can make a real contribution to the field[1]. And he&#x27;s right. The industry has changed how it works since the 90s, so in order to stay relevant in the industry you have to change too. Change with the times, or get left behind. Adapt, or die. It was always ever thus.<p>[0] &quot;Best Of Luck In Your Future Endeavors&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33452920">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33452920</a></div><br/><div id="37897249" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37897249" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robertlagrant</span><span>|</span><a href="#37896758">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37896623">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37897249">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37897249">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I sometimes wonder how much could be saved if big games like Call of Duty didn&#x27;t come with endless character and weapon customisation screens to make changes that just don&#x27;t matter to the game.

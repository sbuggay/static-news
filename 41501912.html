Three reasons. First, I’ve felt for a few years now that the startups I’m seeing don’t seem so much like progress as just shopkeeping. This isn’t a dig: there’s money to be made razoring a thin slice off a huge market, and there’s certainly less risk in that than there is building a market from scratch. But it’s just not that interesting. The excitement I had as a 14-year old in 1979 trying to understand everything there was to know about computers, because this was something that could radically improve people’s lives, I just don’t get anymore. And not because people’s lives, the people who have access to the tech, aren’t better, I think they are (although this, of course, has not been as unalloyed as I imagined as a 14-year old.) But because I think the tech is no longer improving lives, it’s just maintaining the current status quo. It just feels, I don’t know, done.<p>This is remarkable to me because I would say that right now is one of the most exciting times to invest ever. We are in one of the new platforms: VC hasn&#x27;t been so interesting to me since ~2013, when cryptocurrency offered a whole new greenfield, or 2008, when the iPhone changed everything for mobile, or ~1998, when the WWW began to mature enough to allow greenfield everything. (With an honorable mention to VR - still the new platform of the future...) Just think about LLMs and programming! Programming hasn&#x27;t been about to change this much, this fundamentally, since the invention of networks or timesharing, perhaps. How can you look at this and write it all off as &#x27;shopkeeping&#x27; with no &#x27;building a market from scratch&#x27; and &#x27;just not that interesting&#x27;?<p>I think maybe the real reason is the next one: they&#x27;re just older, and no longer have the gumption and energy to try to dive into the Shiny New Thing, and it&#x27;s time to hang up their hat and call it a day, leaving it to the next generation.</div><br/><div id="41538451" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538451" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">programjames</span><span>|</span><a href="#41513037">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537640">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538451">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538451">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But most of the AI startups <i>are</i> just razoring a thin slice off a huge market.

I do think there is a good chance that LLMs as they exist will not change anything nearly as significantly as the hype is predicting. But I think there is scope for the technology, if it continues developing, to significantly help people.<p>The most interesting and clear AI-based product I can imagine is a true personal assistant, that can autonomously handle tasks like &quot;book me a barber&#x27;s appointment this week&quot; (while taking into account my work days, my meetings, my other personal appointments, etc) or &quot;I want to meet up with Joe, Susan, and Mary for a nice dinner, book us a table&quot; (and your personal assistant would sync up with their personal assistants, or with themselves directly if they don&#x27;t have one, to arrange this, and suggest some possible venues and so on). And it would help remind you of important upcoming events, help organize your shopping and so on. And of course, it would do all of this semi-interactively (&quot;The best slot I&#x27;m seeing for your barber appointment would be on Tuesday at 3 PM, but you have that call with Andrew, can that be moved?&quot;).<p>All of these things seem relatively doable in principle, with existing technologies, as long as AIs improve on their reasoning skills and someone spends the time and effort to connect a single AI to several core technologies (in this case, email, calendars, web search, maybe some reservation apps, and some camera apps to help recognize various things).</div><br/><div id="41538217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41538217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j4coh</span><span>|</span><a href="#41513037">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537995">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537398">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41538217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41538217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I can understand why this person sees a natural language personal assistant as shopkeeping, though, compared with the invention (for example) of the internet or what it was like around the time personal computers started existing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41537398" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41537398" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbor</span><span>|</span><a href="#41513037">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537272">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41537299">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41537398">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41537398">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would argue what has changed is structural, not technological.<p>As our age continues to gild itself to further extremes everyday, I just don’t think there’s space to use small groups of optimistic hackers to bring bright new things to humanity through risk-prone startups.

It’s both, of course! But entertaining the notion that it <i>might</i> be all skill seems dishonest to yourself, IMHO. Investing makes money because that’s how literally everything is setup in our world, and this person was in a unique position to personally assess their investment targets along financial lines in a context where that mattered more than it ever has.<p>This person just seems more self-aware than most about their strategy (“unicorns!!1!”), while paradoxically being very unaware about their own position within the world (they’re very much an economist, even if they lack the training) and history (the reason computers seem to be “supporting the status quo” instead of disrupting socioeconomic systems is very much something that everyone should have seen coming).<p><pre><code>  Right now I have enough money to do what I want. I don’t have enough money that other people do what I want. To me that sounds like the perfect place to be.

Beautifully said, really profound thought. This is really the distillation of what socialism promises to strive towards, in my eyes; prosperity enough for personal liberty, without the goal of hierarchy.<p><pre><code>  On dark days I think of what Jung said in his memoirs: “Only if we know that the thing that truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interests upon futilities…” My view of the infinite is probably different than Jung’s, but I think he’s right: the only way to avoid feeling like your work is pointless is to contribute to something much larger than yourself. 
</code></pre>
Another beautifully worded thought, and I wish them Godspeed on this journey. This is the only path that doesn’t end in futility, as far as I can see. I will say, if this is your mindset, be careful not to fall prey to what Hegel would call “a bad infinity” — a single technology, project, or social mechanism that you invest your entire vision of the future in, kinda like thinking of infinity as some specific really big number (a common practice!). True (“good”) infinity is not an object: it is a process, a practice, a dialectical <i>structure</i> that you employ in the limit. It is perpetually approaching the ethos of planting trees whose shade you will never know, not finding the perfect tree to plant.<p>In the context of pro-social technical contributions in 2024, I think this simply means that you need to buckle down, swallow your pride for a second&#x2F;month&#x2F;year, and identify others who are (trying to be-) living the way you think is necessary so that you can learn their motivations and methods, and of course what they need that you can help with. We have been incredibly lucky to be the puzzle-solving class at a time when that was uniquely profitable, but I think humility is necessary when considering these broader questions. I’m a fan of philosophy and cooperative syndicalism, but I’m sure there’s optimistic prosocial groups out there for everybody, if you look deeply enough.<p>Jeez that was long, whoops — and I’m just some kid so probably wasted breath. Thanks for sharing OP, will be thinking about this fella for a while… again, Godspeed. I’ll leave anyone bored enough to read this far with a better writer than I:<p><pre><code>  To consider some Being-there as it is in the absolute just consists in saying of it: of course we have spoken of it just now as if it were something, but in the absolute, the A=A, there is nothing of the sort; in the absolute everything is one. To pit this single insight, that in the absolute everything is the same, against discriminating and fulfilled cognition, or cognition seeking and demanding fulfilment—or to pass off its absolute as the night in which, as the saying goes, all cows are black—this is the naiveté of emptiness of cognition.

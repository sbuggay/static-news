That’s the foundation of a good business relationship.<p>If they have the money to pay, but are ignoring you then escalate from your contact at the company to someone higher in the chain. If that doesn’t work and it’s a relatively small amount of money then you can try to enforce the contact.<p>I’m in the UK and there’s a small claims court for specifically this. I’ve not gone through it myself but from those that have it’s simple enough to do yourself without paying a lawyer, but it’s time consuming. Im not sure where you are but look into if there’s in in your jurisdiction.<p>If the client likely doesn’t have the money to pay, then it’s likely a waste of time to pursue it.

These are things that have worked for me &#x2F; people I know that I am happy to share as anecdotes. Seek real competent legal advice that&#x27;s relevant to your jurisdiction.<p>1. Generally your terms need a dispute resolution process.<p>It should outline:
1. What happens if either party is upset. (Notice, mediation etc) Note this should allow you to send the customer notice about breaches of contract &#x2F; behaviour &#x2F; whatever as well as them complaining about the quality of the work. 
2. How the agreement can be terminated
3. The timeframe for a dispute to be lodged
4. What happens to payment while there is an ongoing dispute
5. And most important of all, that a failure to lodge a dispute and participate in the dispute resolution process indicates that the work provided is of acceptable quality and payment is forthcoming<p>This means that, if your terms ever proceed to litigation, a judge applying a reasonable third party test will see a party going dark as failing to engage with dispute resolution and accepting the goods. In a lot of jurisdictions this is implied, and covered in full or in part by your other terms. However I have seen this process roll so many shitty clients who fuck around for 3 months and then when proceedings begin they get the legal advice that this is difficult to challenge due to their shitty behaviour. In fact I have seen people stipulate that violating terms of the contract without engaging with the dispute resolution process requires full contract (or even penalty) payout regardless of project status (ie this clause has for people with particularly shitty clients, become revenue positive)<p>2. You need to outline (in support of the above) how the contract should be terminated and on what grounds it can be terminated, outside of the Dispute Resolution process. You also need to outline situations that can modify the agreement. How slippages are communicated. Etc. Then you need to constantly meet the expectation set on your side.<p>3. You need to outline clear payment and arrears processes. Payment due dates etc.<p>4. To the best of your ability you need to outline what it is you are actually expecting to deliver. I have seen people get stung because their deliverables werent outlined in the contract. Not small guys either. Companies with assets in excess of 100 million, not writing down what their product is, how to measure its success etc. Just getting rolled in court because they thought they had a relationship with the customer and the customer just bails.<p>Conversely, I have seen people get stung because they signed a well written contract and didnt read it. If the contract says the deliverables are documentation, dont expect a website and documentation.<p>5. If you have something like a directors guarantee in your jurisdiction get one in any circumstance you possibly can.<p>6. Before engaging with your customer sniff around and see if they are good for it. Lots of predatory businesses with no cash on hand out there trying to get to their next paycheck by bringing in bright eyed bushy tailed contractors and then not paying them after the works done.<p>7. The contract should stipulate that the written contract supercedes any other prior agreement. This isnt being nasty. It means that the customer knows that they can only expect whats written on the paper. If they imagined a conversation where you said they would get a ferarri its not in scope. If theres an email where you suggested an extra deliverable, but it didnt make it into final pricing, its excluded.<p>8. If possible never make a contract with a person from the USA. Probably the most important rule.<p>9. If you can in your jurisdiction, stipulate that you will register the debt formally first, and then initiate proceedings to collect. This gives you a strategy. Notice -&gt; Notice &gt; Registration &gt; Notice &gt; Legal &gt; Court. Often when people understand theres a path, and you show you take the first step, they will relent.<p>10. Actually do it. Once you have paid a lawyer to draft you a good contract, stand by it. Its cheaper generally to get good legal advice, and pursue costs against a solvent dickhead, than to just take their shit. It also makes it better for everyone else. If people know they will get stung for being a douchebag, then they are less likely to be a douchebag. Only exception is point 8 where its cultural.<p>Basically:<p>Prepare to defend yourself.
Defend yourself. 
Americans suck.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

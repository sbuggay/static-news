Not just for the algorithm, but also for everything around the algorithm. For instance, you don&#x27;t have time to waste parsing a list of integers. You have to get these parts right the first time almost without thinking, so that you can focus on the hard parts, like the algorithm. For example, if you are not confident that you parsed the input data correctly, you will lose time trying to figure out if you algorithm was wrong or if you fed it the wrong data.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37808808" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37808808" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">theusus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37808724">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808462">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37808808">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37808808">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">IMO, Algorithms are overstated.

The rating systems on competitive websites makes seeing your improvement very rewarding.<p>It serves as an endless source of problem solving &quot;ingenuity&quot;.

Even when he was working on his first (and major) book in Paris, he was spending evenings on that neurosis. &#x27;Pólya-Szegö humiliates me&#x27;, he wrote. &#x27;I never really know what&#x27;s going on, but I can now work quite a few of the problems and seem to learn thereby some things of general interest.&#x27;&quot; [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leonard_Jimmie_Savage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leonard_Jimmie_Savage</a><p>[2] Quote from Paul Halmos&#x27;s <i>Automathography</i></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37800333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37800333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">raunakchhatwal</span><span>|</span><a href="#37808462">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37808743">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37800333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37800333">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I definitely agree that it improves writing fewer bugs. When I first began using leetcode, I was proud that I was able to begin at leetcode medium and even solve the hard ones because the tip was to grind the easy ones before progressing to medium and hard problems. However, reading up on how DSA interviews are conducted, I realized that I probably would be penalized for not getting my solution right the first few times, whereas my style of solving leetcode problems at first was to get it right only after like the sixth+ try. Also, leetcode problems are also a good way to learn new languages, I&#x27;m currently using it to learn Rust, and learning Haskell probably would&#x27;ve been smoother if leetcode supported it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37808743" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37808743" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">logdahl</span><span>|</span><a href="#37800333">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37808743">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37808743">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have been wanting to get into competitive programming.

My wife set up a new business a few years ago and I had another phone number with distinctive ring running within 20 mins.  Obviously not your usual setup.

I do note that this does not work for everyone but for me in the UK it does.  I do have access to long running static IPs and have made sure that their &quot;reputation&quot; is top notch.<p>I recently added a &quot;vanity&quot; domain for a friend so they can escape ISP lock in.  Their surname is the same as a village in North England and some wankers had squatted on village.co.uk and wanted £25,000 for it.  I advised my friend that if he registered a UK LTD with his family name then we could probably get the .co.uk by default.  I registered .org.uk instead - too much faff for my friend.  I set up SPF to use my family&#x27;s MTA (Exim) to ensure that things tie up.  A .org.uk domain costs about £6 + VAT (sales tax) hereabouts.  I suggested £20 per annum as a charitable donation of his choice, in return for me running his email.  He chose St Margaret&#x27;s Hospice.  It turns out that both my mum and his mum received end of life care from St Madge&#x27;s.<p>I have digressed somewhat!<p>You do need at least two identities for safety.  You mention &quot;my domain&quot; - do you actually run it?  If not then you need another one as well.  Do not, whatever you do, rely on any single hyperscaler to give a shit.  The well informed user can route around damage in the cloud.  It sounds like you are unlikely to run your own system(s) so have a backup plan.  Remember that say FB provide a smtp service if that helps - ISTR that id@facebook.com should work.  There are lots of other freeish email offerings.  Just make sure you have two well known identities that those whom you care about can contact you with.  You can also recommend the same advice to them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36638325" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36638325" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Arnavion</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640181">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36640048">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36638325">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36638325">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, different domain on a different registrar is the usual solution.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36640048" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36640048" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36638298">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36638325">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36642558">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36640048">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36640048">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m using my Hotmail (yes I&#x27;m old, shut up) for my critical-to-life email communiques because I&#x27;m reasonably sure Microsoft won&#x27;t randomly shit on me, unlike Google whom I&#x27;m always wary of even though I&#x27;ve had my Gmail for the better part of 2 decades now.<p>For services that allow tying more than one email to, I&#x27;ve got one or the other as a backup&#x2F;secondary so I won&#x27;t be completely fucked one way or the other.<p>As a general concern it&#x27;s good to not have all your eggs in one basket anyway.

Consider flying to some far away location. Would you rather<p>A) A short flight from your local airport to a nearby hub and then transfer to a long haul flight to the far away location<p>B) A long flight from your local airport to a far away hub and then transfer to a short flight to get to your final destination.<p>If something goes wrong, its likely to happen at the transfer point. If something goes wrong, you want to be in a place where you have the most resources available to you. Usually being close to home affords you the most resources&#x2F;options. Stakes are much lower for commuter train travel, but it still rings true for me.</div><br/><div id="36570407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36570407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567208">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36570407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36570407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think this analogy hold up all that well.<p>For the commuter example (at least in the US), often the first leg is a drive (in a car) to the train station.  When the commuter-rail train gets to <i>its</i> destination, you don&#x27;t have the car anymore, so you want to be as close to <i>your</i> destination as possible.  Even then, if I have to take a local train from there, and something goes wrong with it, at least I can probably get a taxi or something.<p>Regardless, in your airline example, I would probably want (B), not (A).  If I were to choose (A), and there was a problem with my short-haul local flight, I&#x27;m probably missing my long-haul connection, which will be more difficult to re-arrange.  If I take the long-haul flight first, and something gets messed up with the short-haul connection at the destination, I likely have more options, possibly even including a train or car.  Sure, the worst case might be worse (I get stuck at the connecting airport and need to get a hotel overnight), but I think the average case is probably better.<p>Sure, if I want to <i>bail</i> on my trip if anything goes wrong, the short-haul-first approach works better, but I don&#x27;t think there are many situations where I&#x27;d want to bail rather than finding another way to get there.<p>But overall I&#x27;m not sure the main issue is when things go wrong.  For commuting, there are still benefits to the happy path when the connection is closer to the origin.  If the train station is next door to my house, but the station on the other end is 15 miles from the office, that&#x27;s still a pain to deal with.  The opposite is much easier.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36567208" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36567208" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rainsford</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565629">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36570407">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36566097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36567208">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36567208">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re on the right track, but I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s even more abstract than this.  Assuming a transfer represents uncertainty in arrival time, do you want it early or later in your trip?  If the transfer is near the end of your journey, it means the uncertainty is ahead of you for most of the trip.  Even if the early part of your trip is going smoothly, you still don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll arrive on time.  On the other hand, if you get your transfer over with early in your trip, you can experience the rest of your journey with more confidence you&#x27;ll arrive as expected.

I used to live one MUNI stop from BART, and I came to see that first leg as negligible in the same way that walking to the MUNI station did.</div><br/><div id="36567106" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36567106" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glenngillen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567049">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36568380">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36567106">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36567106">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I initially felt the same as you, but then I thought about some of the times this has actually happened.

It is easier and less stressful for an American to drive part of a commute and ride one train than to drive none of it and risk missing an infrequently operating transfer that strands them far from home.<p>Suburban Europeans, with exceptions, do not do this, because their denser urban transit systems and job locations are built around foot or transit access. It is easier and less stressful for a European to ride the train all the way because, even if a transfer is required, it is more likely to occur closer to home and with a more frequently operating service.<p>So, transit proposals in the United States that propose solutions based on European models without recognizing this American trait â often deeply rooted in experiences over years of bad transfer experiences in places that have transit, and operating against a cultural car-friendly bias in places that don&#x27;t â are less likely to succeed.<p>Or, as the article puts it:<p>&gt; To the extent that this relates to American commuter rail reforms, itâs about coverage within the city: multiple city stations, good (free, frequent) connections to local urban rail, high frequency all day to encourage urban travel (a train within the city that runs every half an hour might as well not run).</div><br/><div id="36566096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36566096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">afterburner</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565007">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567311">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36566096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36566096">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not about American or European. Where Americans can reliably take public transit the whole way, their thinking would be the same as the Europeans you describe.<p>It&#x27;s just about how a car leg compares to a train leg or a bus leg. Of course the car-to-train transfer will seem relatively frictionless compared to the other options. It&#x27;s the easiest of them. That the car leg is first when leaving in the morning is more about the circumstances of suburban commuting than the transfer point&#x27;s distance from home&#x2F;dest. Of course the car leg is closer to home, your car is at home. If you already lived in the city with better train access you wouldn&#x27;t even be using a car.<p>On top of that, usually the whole idea of using a car is to make it a car+train commute, rather than a bus+train commute. Usually these distant car+train commuters aren&#x27;t taking a bus as the last step, because then they would probably just drive the whole way (instead of bus+train+bus just do car). And they wouldn&#x27;t take a bus as the first step because that was the whole point of using the car, and the only place than can use the car as part of a multi-mode commute anyways.<p>It really weakens the claim that it&#x27;s about the transfer being closer to home that determines the decision.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36567311" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36567311" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">geraldwhen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565007">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36566096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565887">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36567311">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36567311">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most Americans donât use public transit and cannot.

Abandoning that car leaves behind the potential to move larger items or stacks of things.  Plus the car might be critical for visiting friends, stores, etc after work.<p>All of that factors into the commuter cost.</div><br/><div id="36568094" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36568094" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zten</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565007">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567194">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36568650">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36568094">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36568094">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Offhand, I can&#x27;t think of any &#x27;park and ride&#x27; style Car &lt;&gt; Transit (train or not) interface in the USA that _does_ charge anything to park there.

These trains are lower frequency services mostly focused on moving people from suburban areas to city centers.<p>The reason these trains donât work for suburb-to-suburb commutes:<p>Suburban offices arenât close to suburban rail stations. This means making this trip requires a transfer to a bus. A car-train-bus trip isnât more attractive than just driving your car the entire way because suburban traffic is lighter and you can route around the city. The author notes that driving to a commuter station is usually done to avoid city traffic and parking fees. The author thinks companies would need to site jobs near train stations to make suburb-to-suburb commutes work. However, US suburban density and land values favor residential property and companies would pay a high price for property near a station. With that prospect, theyâd rather rent space downtown.<p>The author jumps into issues with topology and connections midway through that point:<p>US commuter lines donât run through the city center to other suburbs and even when they do, itâs only ever possible to get to one other line without transferring. Moreover, the frequency of trains in the reverse direction (reverse peak) is lower meaning longer trip times when you transfer.<p>US commuter trains often serve only one station in the city and require a transfer to one or more extra services. For example, in Boston there are metro job centers which are far from the two commuter train stations. The locations listed require multiple metro transfers to reach from the commuter rail stations which arenât served by all lines. European systems like the German S-Bahn avoid this by having many stations throughout the downtown core that are shared between lines and metro services. The closest example to the S-Bahn in the US would be BART and SEPTA. (The author doesnât get into discussing those lines and focuses on Boston as it had the lowest share of work commuters on its commuter rail lines.)<p>ââ<p>My thoughts on the main development point: A more attainable goal would be to encourage development that allows employees to afford to live near their work or at least on the same train line.

Some cities&#x27; transit planners are trying to find ways to serve those commute patterns. A few European cities are able to do that successfully, and the article looks at whether their approaches are applicable to the U.S. The answer is mostly no, due to the American suburban jobs being more sprawling rather than built on top of &#x2F; near train stations. People are willing to drive from their house to a park-and-ride for a train to downtown, but doing that in reverse is inconvenient and unpopular. But it might work in a few cases where the suburban job centers are in a compact cluster, like a few examples the article gives in the Boston area. To the extent the article has a take-away recommendation, it&#x27;s basically, &quot;planners should focus on better serving existing compact suburban job centers like those&quot;. One problem mentioned is that even where new transit-oriented development is built in the U.S., there is usually more economic demand for it to be residential rather than commercial, so it generally doesn&#x27;t make economic sense to put offices on top of suburban train stations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36565657" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36565657" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Symbiote</span><span>|</span><a href="#36565403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565576">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565954">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36565657">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36565657">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might live in Luton, take the train to London, then use the Underground to get to a job at Canary Wharf.<p>Americans and Canadians apparently don&#x27;t do this, since the &#x27;new&#x27; just-out-of-the-centre development has residential buildings near the station, unlike Canary Wharf where the nearest buildings to the station are offices.<p>The suburban trains also run frequently and all day, so Brixton to Wembley is a reasonable journey by train.

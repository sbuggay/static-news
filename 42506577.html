Sleep in, have brunch, wander over to my neighbor&#x27;s house around noon to see what kind of loot they got and help them play with their new toys.  Sometimes we&#x27;d go out for Chinese food and a movie.<p>But my favorite was Christmas 1999.  My girlfriend was out of town with her family and there was no reason to go home to mine, so I was alone (my roommates were with their families too).  I decided to go to the movies in Emeryville.<p>I was going to see Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, and Man on the Moon.  The timing lined up perfectly to see all three.  About 50 other people were there to do the same thing.  When it was time to go in for the first movie, a staff member came out and told us that it would start about 30 minutes late.  This would of course cause us to miss all the other movies.<p>About 30 people stepped forward at the same time and asked to speak to the manager. :). We explained to him that it would throw our whole schedule off.  Since it was Christmas, he was kind enough to adjust the schedule so that we could all see all three movies.<p>That was a great day.</div><br/><div id="42506886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42506886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ianwalter</span><span>|</span><a href="#42506783">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42507351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42506886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42506886">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wow what a great set of movies too</div><br/><div id="42506897" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42506897" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jedberg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42506783">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42506886">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42507351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42506897">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42506897">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1999 is considered by many enthusiasts as a peak movie year.

Mutlu Noeller! Frohe Weihnachten!<p>I was born in Istanbul, a sprawling, chaotic city that&#x27;s a fascinating blend of thousands of cultures. Christmas was always a thing there, even under an Islamist regime. As a non-believer, I never cared much for religious holidays, but I did enjoy the cozy decorations and sipping Glühwein (mulled wine). Beyond that, it didn&#x27;t mean much to me.<p>Now I live in Germany. My first Christmas here, back in 2009, was quite different. I was alone in a rented room provided by my employer, watching TV shows I couldn&#x27;t understand on a tiny screen, just trying to pass the time. My laptop wasn&#x27;t working (the charging cable was broken), and I was bored out of my mind.<p>Around 6 PM, there was a knock on the door. It was my employer, heading to a hippie-style gathering in the forest to celebrate Christmas. He figured I might be alone and decided to come in person since I hadn&#x27;t answered my phone.<p>Of course, I said yes, and it turned out to be one of the most heartwarming experiences of my life. The group was incredibly kind, and even though I was the only foreigner, they went out of their way to make me feel included (switching to English when talking to each other, for example). The setting was magical: small fires inside carved logs, nature-themed decorations, and delicious food I&#x27;d never tasted before. I was so happy.<p>That day, my love for Germany grew a hundredfold.</div><br/><div id="42507696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42507696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Alex-Programs</span><span>|</span><a href="#42507485">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42506830">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42507696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42507696">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is sweet.

I got a Xbox in &#x27;01, Xbox 360 in &#x27;05; but they didn&#x27;t quite have the same &quot;magic&quot; that they had when I was young. Also as a young kid, watching the Rankin Bass stop motion movies on the days leading up to Christmas. Then talking with my brother and sister while we tried (failed) to sleep on Christmas Eve, watching more and more obscure Christmas cartoons and whatever else would come on TV late on Christmas Eve night&#x2F;Christmas morning.<p>The best non-Christmas morning memories were just random times I was at family Christmas parties or gatherings. Seeing aunts, uncles, and cousins dancing talking having fun. As a kid, we used to have the parties at family homes, which was always fun and super memorable. Later we moved to a hall as the family got bigger and cousins started to bring their children, in laws, and friends. I can&#x27;t really point out any particular memory as good; just all the time spent with family, not necessarily caring about what else was going on in the world at the time.</div><br/><div id="42506918" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42506918" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MarkMarine</span><span>|</span><a href="#42506809">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42507429">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42506918">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42506918">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My grandmother broke the Christmas gift rules with my parents and got my brother and I a NES, Tetris, duck hunt with the gun, and I believe the Olympics with the power mat.

Grandma had a nack for tweaking my mom any way she could, one of the meanest people I’ve ever met in my life but this year our interests aligned.<p>My mom was enthralled by Tetris, better at the game than anyone in the house by a good 10 levels, and basically impossible to depose from the controller.

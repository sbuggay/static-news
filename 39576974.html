This article is something I put together very quickly and it probably assumes a certain degree of familiarity with the political context around policing in Albuquerque (which either side will tell you is very contentious) and, more broadly, policing and civil justice. Even without the currently evolving bribery scandal, the level of public trust in APD (and even the city council&#x27;s confidence in APD) is very low. APD&#x27;s transparency and accountability, or lack thereof, has been a common locus of the debate. On the other hand, another major issue has been APD&#x27;s chronic understaffing, and APD contends that ShotSpotter and other elements of their real-time program help to close the gap that results from their limited personnel. With gun crime as one of the foremost issues in the city, whether you view APD positively or negatively, ShotSpotter is a big part of the discussion right now.<p>Historically, APD&#x27;s use of pervasive surveillance technology has been a flashpoint in the debate. APD has live access to perhaps 3-4 thousand cameras across the city (they aren&#x27;t very transparent about this and it depends on how far along the APS integration project is), they have used facial recognition against driver&#x27;s license photos and other sources since 2014, they have installed ALPR throughout the city and recently expanded retention to one year, etc. This is all fed into the Real-Time Crime Center, which uses a data fusion product from a vendor called Genetec to provide sort of a futuristic point-and-click data system that combines ShotSpotter detections with video feeds with service call records etc. to produce sort of a dossier on any given person or location.<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of things going on in city politics, especially with regard to crime and policing, and so the topic of surveillance has mostly fallen out of public attention.<p>Still, APD&#x27;s refusal to say in any detail what parts of the city were covered by ShotSpotter has been one of the big ongoing frustrations, particularly among those who favor police reform. I mostly wrote this article to highlight that there is finally information on the matter available. The concerns about how distribution of sensors and, more broadly, use of surveillance technology impacts civil rights and quality of life in the city are mentioned mainly as an aside and I do not attempt to articulate the pros and cons. That would require a rather lengthy piece as the topic is complex, and currently the greater part of the controversy isn&#x27;t even about the wisdom of deploying ShotSpotter, but rather over whether or not ShotSpotter even works (and, consequently, whether or not it&#x27;s simply a waste of city money, at a rate of around $5 million).</div><br/><div id="39577771" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39577771" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jcrawfordor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577495">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39578942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39577771">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39577771">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Let me follow up, and maybe I should write this up on CAB but I don&#x27;t really want to get too much into police reform there, what I know factually about the ShotSpotter system. Most of this comes from discussions with APD leadership and officers in the context of the police oversight role I used to hold, and they are very much limited in what they can say. Some of this is specific to APD SOP and other police departments may vary in their approach.<p>Some sort of software analysis performed by SoundThinking identifies a possible gunshot. The audio recordings are sent to a human analyst, a SoundThinking employee, who reviews the recording and enters an assessment of what it contains (e.g. if it is gunfire, and how many rounds). If the analyst confirms the report, an alert is sent as a text message (I believe in an app they furnish) to staff in APD&#x27;s dispatch center, called the Emergency Communications Center (ECC). The contract includes an SLA on this process of I think 1 or 2 minutes, but I was told that they routinely performed as well as 30 seconds. Some APD personnel, I think usually area commanders but it may have been all field division sergeants, also receive the alerts on their phones.<p>The ECC dispatches the call as a priority 2. P2 is high enough that a ShotSpotter report will &quot;bump&quot; most calls for service except for a caller on the line violent crime in progress. When the officers arrive at the reported location, they make a brief assessment and search the area for suspects or victims. If no suspects or victims are found, a Crime Scene Technician is dispatched (often later as they will wait for daylight) to search the area for evidence such as spent shell casings.<p>My recollection is that I was told they were able to find definitive evidence of actual shots fired in less than five percent of cases, but take that with a grain of salt as I do not believe it was ever put in writing (I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re allowed to by their contract) and I could be remembering wrong. However, it&#x27;s believable that the accuracy of the system is higher than that suggests, as Albuquerque has a lot of wide open spaces that are difficult to search thoroughly if the ShotSpotter location estimate is at all inaccurate.<p>I was told that, when the system was tested by firing blanks, it was not completely effective but that they were satisfied with how effective it was. I was never given a number and I think they had been very specifically prohibited from discussing the testing in detail when they coordinated it with SoundThinking.<p>One of the major criticisms of the ShotSpotter system in Albuquerque is that it results in a relatively large volume of P2 calls that delay police response to most other calls for service. During the worst of the understaffing, I was told that some officers in high-crime areas like the International District spent a large portion of their total shift following up on ShotSpotter activations while there were multiple P3 calls queued. This has probably improved as staffing levels have increased, but in my mind it is the greatest single concern about the system.<p>SoundThinking&#x27;s evasiveness, refusal of independent research, and clear motive to sell their product creates an alarming possibility that they are deceiving police leadership and elected officials into overprioritizing ShotSpotter. It may be a waste of money, which is already a problem, but the much greater concern is that police departments are putting off responding to nonviolent crimes in progress to go to ShotSpotter reports instead, because they have been told by SoundThinking that the accuracy rate of the system is very high.</div><br/><div id="39579187" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39579187" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hcfman</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577771">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39578238">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39579187">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39579187">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I developed a TDOA based sound localization system for the Raspberry Pi<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@kim_94237&#x2F;tdoa-sound-localization-with-the-raspberry-pi-3e777469c4fa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@kim_94237&#x2F;tdoa-sound-localization-with-t...</a><p>and with manual input you can greatly improve the accuracy from what an automatic system could do due to noise and signal degradation.

The case in question came from a shotspotter recording gunshots, and the short clip also happened to include speech within it since it directly followed the sound of shots.</div><br/><div id="39577844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39577844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jcrawfordor</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577874">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39577844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39577844">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ShotSpotter&#x27;s own public statements say that audio is retained for 30 hours, see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soundthinking.com&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;shotspotter-privacy-faqs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soundthinking.com&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;shotspotter-privacy-faqs&#x2F;</a>. In the past they provided Albuquerque with a document that said 72 hours, but I believe they have been reducing that period over time. It may also depend on their specific contract with the law enforcement agency. Still, we know that they must retain recordings, because they do take requests from customers to reanalyze data that did not result in an alert.<p>For convenience, the most relevant text: &quot;If the system misses a gunfire incident, police may contact the company to see if there is any audio or location evidence. In this case, only authorized ShotSpotter personnel with proper credentials can access sensor audio to search. Their search is limited to the 30- hour sensor storage timeframe.&quot;<p>ShotSpotter used to have significantly fewer privacy protections, and retention was indefinite early in the product&#x27;s life. Fortunately, a combination of legal challenges and statutory privacy policies among their customers have lead to them significantly improving their privacy controls over time.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39577874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39577874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bikezen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577495">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577817">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577844">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39577874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39577874">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is that, like provable though, thats my biggest issue.

Commonwealth v. Denison, No. BRCR2012-0029 (Mass. Super. Ct. Oct. 7, 2015)
&quot;ShotSpotter is a listening and recording system that runs 24&#x2F;7, attuned to the sound of gunfire. When the system hears gunfire, or what it recognizes as gunfire, it locates it, reports it, preserves the recording, and send the recording to the customer within seconds.” The defendant, charged with first degree murder, moved to suppress a recording made by ShotSpotter of an verbal exchange among numerous individuals before and after the fatal gunshots. The court rejected that the argument that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because the exchange was “audible by anyone passing and was in fact heard by a crowd of neighbors and other witnesses.” However, the court found that the exchange was an “oral communication” and that the recording was a prohibited “interception” under the Massachusetts Wiretap Act because the defendant had no knowledge that the exchange was being recorded. The court also found that the interception was “willful” because the police had “purposefully directed the placement of the sensors.” The court granted the motion to suppress: “the continuous secret audio surveillance of selective urban neighborhoods ** is the type of surreptitious eavesdropping as an investigative tool that the Legislature sought to prohibit.&quot;
&quot;&quot;&quot; [0]<p>The verbal exchange was recorded because it was incident to the shooting that triggered the recording. In addition to recording the shooter(s) shoot the victim(s), it also recorded the shooter(s) and victim(s) speak before the shooting. This was in public so there wasn&#x27;t an expectation of privacy, and I can&#x27;t imagine this is the kind of recording that the Massachusetts&#x27;s legislature &quot;sought to prohibit&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mass.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;CRIMINAL%20ESI%20DEC%202017.pdf#page=176" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mass.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;CRIMINAL%20E...</a></div><br/><div id="39578492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39578492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hamburglar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577104">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39578229">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39578444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39578492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39578492">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; These devices don&#x27;t send audio over the network unless a shooting-like noise is detected.<p>How does this jibe with the fact that the police can apparently request a ShotSpotter operator review of audio recordings for up to 30 days if a known shooting is missed by the system?

At the time, East PA was poor and had a massively underfunded police department. This resulted in drug dealers realizing the city was a great place to deal from - as the probability they&#x27;d get caught was really low. In 1992, East PA had the US&#x27;s highest per capita murder rate. (We&#x27;d hear small arms fire many nights and I remember listening to the radio and hearing a BBC reporter calling in a report from less than a mile away from my house (talking from a phone booth in the since demolished Whiskey Gulch neighborhood) - talking about a war zone like atmosphere with dealers openly carrying Uzi&#x27;s.)  Anyway, in spite of all this nothing ever happened on our street. We walked around without any fear of crime at all. Correlation isn&#x27;t causation, but it&#x27;s hard to shake an impression that having an actual police department had something to do with that.

The joke was that they were only locked in the fall, to prevent people from &quot;gifting&quot; you their excess zucchini.  My father always left the keys in his cars as well, in case someone needed to borrow it.  Our house was locked only if we left for long vacations.  The key was lost sometime after I left home, and no attempt was made to replace it.

Given the already tragic number of shootings of Black people by police, that is a recipe for trouble.<p>2)    Indeed, the Chicago IG’s analysis of Chicago police data found that the “perceived aggregate frequency of ShotSpotter alerts” in some neighborhoods leads officers to engage in more stops and pat downs.<p>3)    The placement of sensors in some neighborhoods but not others means that the police will detect more incidents (real or false) in places where the sensors are located. That can distort gunfire statistics and create a circular statistical justification for over-policing in communities of color.</div><br/><div id="39578422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39578422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xeckr</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39578185">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39578422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39578422">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The summary here seems to be that no, police do not regularly invent false positives for ShotSpotter.<p>Regarding:<p>1) How do you know you are dealing with a false alarm?

That was the part I referred to as misremembering in my above comment. The false alarms come from the system itself, not necessarily police lying about it. However the reports from multiple sources do say that false alarms occur at an alarming rate, and this leads to over policing.<p>I wanted to provide a citation for the article&#x27;s claims of over policing, and I believe I have done so (the ACLU article has multiple high quality sources clearly linked in the first few paragraphs).<p>Your comment mentioned that shotspotter leading to a high police presence is &quot;obviously a good thing&quot; and that if you lived there, you would want this too. But if the residents were happy with what was happening, there would be no controversy. The problem with over policing is that it leads to unfair treatment of marginalized communities, and this is what people are unhappy about.<p>It seems like you are trying to reason away these concerns, or get me to answer your follow on questions, but I am not an expert here, just someone who remembered seeing articles about issues with the system. I would encourage you to review those sources and check their methodology regarding false positive detection rates, and seek additional information about over policing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39577447" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39577447" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nimbius</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577511">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39577447">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39577447">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hard to imagine this can discern between things like engine backfires, fireworks and garbage trucks effectively enough to be anything more than a really expensive checkmark on some captains yearly performance review.</div><br/><div id="39577672" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39577672" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacurtis</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577447">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39577672">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39577672">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They can&#x27;t.

ShotSpotter also seems to alert to things that are either false positives (construction sounds, fireworks, etc) or are not useful.<p>Chicago IG says 9&#x2F;10 times when officers respond to a ShotSpotter alert they find nothing. 1&#x2F;10 times it leads to an arrest, but the arrest isn&#x27;t always strictly related to the ShotSpotter event - e.g. police responding to an event stop a speeding car and discover drug paraphernalia or an unrelated gun.<p>Some cities, e.g. Atlanta, discontinued ShotSpotter over cost benefit concerns. From their analysis it seemed a better use of money to hire more officers than use ShotSpotter.

In San Jose it was used to help enforce rules against firing guns in the air.  In these cases there would usually be reports to police, but finding the shooter was extremely difficult.  With ShotSpotter it became possible to identify locations on individual lots.  Using this information enforcement became much more effective and there was a huge reduction in celebratory gunfire.  In a large number of these cases no charges needed to be filed as gun owners were often uninformed, apologetic, and compliant.  From the start of this program it was explicitly stated that ShotSpotter information would only be used by constables on patrol and would not be admitted as evidence in court.  System coverage was based on where crimes were being reported.  That such criteria overlap with race and class makes sense without necessarily being connected.<p>It would be interesting to know if there might be some reasonable bounds that could be used to enable ShotSpotter to be used without being considered intrusive surveillance.  Having information about gunshots or possible gunshots can be extremely useful for responders who need to understand where events are happening.  This does not necessarily mean that the system has to be open to other uses, especially recording and replay of audio.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39577044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39577044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JoeyBananas</span><span>|</span><a href="#39577579">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39577063">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39577044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39577044">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve experienced living in a neighborhood covered by shot spotter and hearing gun shots outside, and I think shot spotter is great.

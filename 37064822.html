Can someone analogize what they are doing here? It somehow reminds me of the Django admin capabilities but expanded to any Typescript base technologies?<p>I have trouble wrapping my head around the use case for this. Is the target market existing businesses that already have APIs (probably as REST services), maybe some databases and they just want to quickly wire up some UI to it? It seems a bit heavy handed for writing an entire application.<p>I can imagine maybe a medium sized business where the data science, sales, marketing, customer service etc. teams want some access to the production system data in a format other than Tableau or Microsoft BI. And perhaps their engineering team is entirely focused on product development or operations and so no significant resources can be allocated. I guess this might allow more junior or jack-of-all-trades engineers to whip up basic admin features?<p>To be honest, even in small startups I&#x27;ve worked at, cranking out admin dashboards using React was just so trivial that I can&#x27;t imagine paying to make it slightly easier. And looking at their code examples, it doesn&#x27;t seem all that more simple. I suppose there maybe some goldilocks zone between startups that just crank that kind of stuff out and huge enterprises where entire teams exist to manage internal tools. In that zone perhaps having these kinds of platforms can expedite internal tooling creation.</div><br/><div id="37066096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37066096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smt88</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37066096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37066096">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>To be honest, even in small startups I&#x27;ve worked at, cranking out admin dashboards using React was just so trivial that I can&#x27;t imagine paying to make it slightly easier.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t tried Refine, but with Retool, we had non-developers able to build themselves functional admin tools in literally minutes.<p>Writing new code, regardless of how great the React components are, just doesn&#x27;t come close. I can do things with Retool in 2-3 hours that used to take a week or more of a senior React dev&#x27;s time. It&#x27;s at least one order of magnitude of difference, maybe more.</div><br/><div id="37066566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37066566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zoogeny</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066009">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066096">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37066566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37066566">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If this was a no-code solution I would agree. But the developers themselves are in this thread saying things like: &quot;One of the key differences is our code-first preference over no-code, which distinguish Refine from the drag-drop style workflows of Retool, Appsmith, Tooljet, Budibase etc.&quot; Their github README has a short 75 line snippet that shows the React-ish code one needs to implement a basic dashboard for a generic REST service. One of the top comments was from an operations guy asking: &quot;Why do I have to choose between next.js and Remix?&quot; Clearly they are targeting this towards development teams to lessen their burden and not directly at support teams to roll their own. Choosing between next.js vs. Remix only makes sense to a developer.<p>As for &quot;2-3 hours&quot; in no-code vs. &quot;1 week&quot; for a developer, I might challenge that. In many cases if a support team (sales, customer service, marketing, etc.) asked a product team to build something custom for them then they are going to quote product development timelines. However, Most places where I&#x27;ve worked where admin tooling was expected and high-quality the admin features were part of the product feature development. In general, most functionality would be added in some small part of the feature dev time. For example, a 2 week sprint for a new product feature might include 1 day of adding functionality related to that feature to the admin. That is to say, your 1 week quote is almost definitely not the time it would take to add the features but a block of time the product team is quoting to make you go away. That is an org problem, not a technology problem. With Refine, I don&#x27;t think you will bypass this problem since you will need someone capable of using at least React and whatever stack you configure the tool with.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37066549" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37066549" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">molsongolden</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37066549">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37066549">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Cranking out an admin dashboard in react then also means supporting an admin dashboard. The dev is now on the hook for user issues, additional feature requests, hey can you just add this other field, etc… The dev is interrupted and distracted from other work while the other internal team is slowed down and blocked waiting for the dev to clear their tickets.<p>If you have semi-technical users (can muddle through generating SQL using stackoverflow) then unleashing them on a read-only DB copy with an app builder can be better for everyone involved.<p>Something like: “Hey I saw your ticket requesting a ‘user address’ field in the dashboard, do you want the mailing address or billing address? Lmk then I can probably add this today and it’ll go live in the next deploy”  -&gt; user instead adds the field on their own in &lt; 5min<p>Lots of additional use cases for other db interactions too where “let’s just spin up an internal admin panel in the app” can turn into days or weeks of getting input and now the design needs to be thought about and more stakeholders consulted vs. absolute basic functionality being stood up in Retool in a couple of hours.

Refine brags about being developer first. Their example on github is a 75 line React-ish script. So, someone is writing, testing, deploying code. If that isn&#x27;t your dev team, then who is managing that process and supporting it when someone inevitably borks it?<p>My second point is that even no-code tools tend to require developer support sooner or later. What I&#x27;ve noticed for admin tooling is that it often works best when it is driven by the product team. For example, customer support requests comes in which requires devs to stop working, investigate the issue, manually fix up data where necessary, etc. Devs hate doing this. Give the dev the ability to add the functionality to the admin and they often will, just to make the support requests go away. If you take away the admin from the product team then there is more friction in this path.<p>I will admit however, that the quality of life improvements demanded by the support teams often go un-attended. But I don&#x27;t see how Refine will help this go away if it requires someone familiar with next.js&#x2F;React, Ant&#x2F;MaterialUI, etc. to make changes.</div><br/><div id="37068269" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37068269" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">molsongolden</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066009">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37068269">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37068269">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah, I hadn&#x27;t tried the Refine demo and was going totally off of past Retool experiences where creating or modifying an app can mean just picking a UI component and adding SQL.<p>Refine does appear to require developer build-out and is more of quickstart framework.</div><br/><div id="37069733" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37069733" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buremba</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066009">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068269">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068310">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37069733">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37069733">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can build low-code tools with Refine though.

Turning scripts&#x2F;workflows to basic UI&#x27;s with integrated security and observability? You can choose with Windmill, Airplane or Onu.
You don&#x27;t want any overhead or learning curve for your lean project? Start from scratch and build with the great tools React community offers.<p>Refine becomes a better option for complex cases and higher customization requirements. You can give it a try if
* You have to implement a custom design &#x2F; design system,
* You want to be able to customize your stack instead of locking in a black-box architecture.

It is a tad confusing delineating what is what. Having built and sold developer facing tools, *I* have enough context to understand that you mean is &quot;this isn&#x27;t a toy, you can actually use it in for-real production apps with for-real big company requirements even in open source&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think you are doing yourself favors by calling your commercial tier enterprise, as it really confuses the message.<p>* The above is made a bit worse by the fact that you don&#x27;t have any mention of a commercial product on your landing page, so when I got to pricing (usually my second page) and see enterprise, now I am not sure if the landing page is just for commercial project and open-source is just a toy.<p>* As far as I can tell, you don&#x27;t have any marketing pages for the enterprise offering beyond the pricing page? I want to know how it differs. I want to click on the list of additional integrations. I want some docs. Anything you can give me besides contacting sales is going to help. I am not saying it is a paper launch &#x2F; painted door, but it seems like one, and a thin one at that. You may have a really great product, but your GTM seems like it is lacking, and GTM for  products built on open-source is super important, but generally underdeveloped by dev led teams.<p>* Your landing page doesn&#x27;t really tell me who the target audience is, unless I have context of another product. I totally get a play that uses the momentum of another company, but I do think you lean on it a bit too hard here. I need a tagline like &quot;Refine is an opinionated project builder for React developers designed to 10x your ability to stop fighting frameworks and start getting work done&quot; or something to tell me who this is for without relying entirely on knowing retool. Similar, the enterprise product has really compelling features, but without more context on pricing, use-cases, etc, I don&#x27;t know if it is for me.<p>* Your CTA and getting started is reasonable, but, as others mention here, it is giving the user a ton of choices that they may not have a clear idea of pros and cons. I suggest changing from a horizontal card arrangement to a vertical card where you have more space to provide some guidance.<p>* Animations and graphics for marketing pages is very subjective, but imo, the animation of the different domains of front-end apps (backend, react, auth, etc) along with the rotating list of &quot;enterprise-ready&quot; features is really busy and don&#x27;t tell me much. I kept thinking that the firing concern would link with the enterprise ready feature, but it seems they were unrelated which just made it noisy.<p>Architecture &#x2F; deployment model &#x2F; commercial differentiation<p>* Are you doing the hosting directly for enterprise version and including the direct database access? If that is hosted in your cloud... that seems really tricky security wise. If you are hosting in the customer account that seems really tricky in terms of a wide range of clouds etc. I would be curious to know how this has gone so far.<p>* With enterprise and the direct database offerings, it seems like you have two choices of generating APIs that connect to DBs or are doing a more &quot;direct&quot; API that can execute SQL. Both have challenges. is there anything unique there on offer?<p>* The differentiation of features between open source and commercial seems reasonable... but I am concerned that because you don&#x27;t have *any* ability to use any server side integration, it becomes such a different beast that you don&#x27;t have an opportunity to get people to learn it. I would think that moving a &quot;taste&quot; of the server-side capabilities into open-source might be really helpful<p>Small Nits &#x2F; Fixes<p>* The generated project has a lot of places with hardcoded configuration that I know I would need to change for my app... but no docs&#x2F;comments&#x2F;hints to tell me to do that? For example, using Auth0, I have a hardcoded (real) auth0 key and secret. I found it by chance. I personally wouldn&#x27;t do that in a production app, as I want to centralize all config in one place. That seems like something I wouldn&#x27;t be happy with<p>* Your docs are expansive... but could use some refinement. They are hard to navigate, especially the tutorial section, which doesn&#x27;t appear to have any representation in the left nav? They also aren&#x27;t navigable they way I expect docs to be (for example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;refine.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;chakra-ui">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;refine.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;chakra-ui</a> is not a page). I also was able to break the back button in the tutorial section.<p>Hopefully this is helpful, that was a lot of negative stuff, but I do want to close with overall feedback that this is a *really* hard problem and it is clear that there is a lot of potential value here.<p>If you want to get deeper into any of these questions, the email is in my profile, always happy to chat with companies building cool things :)</div><br/></div></div><div id="37066603" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37066603" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">codegeek</span><span>|</span><a href="#37069978">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37068221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37066603">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37066603">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Retool for Enterprise&quot;<p>I assume you have no ties to Retool but using it to explain your product ?

Instead of just giving you a set of pre-made building blocks, Refine goes the extra mile and creates a complete React project for you. This project comes packed with useful hooks and providers that make your work smoother.<p>We also have this &#x27;headless&#x27; feature that lets developers seamlessly blend in their favorite UI framework or their own custom designs without any hassle. This flexibility is particularly great for things like complex admin panels, SAAS interfaces, and B2B portals. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re working on simpler tools for internal use – you know, the ones that don&#x27;t need a lot of tweaking – Refine might offer more complexity than necessary.</div><br/><div id="37068027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37068027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">verdverm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37066040">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066406">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37067159">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37068027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37068027">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">low-code doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean drag-n-drop, though that is typically the association in people&#x27;s minds<p>To us, low-code is really about creating simpler, or higher up the logical stack, abstractions, and then generating the implementation.<p>Our take is not so far off from yours, where we take a code first approach. Users declaratively define their application in CUE and then get most of the code. Rather than providing hooks, we let the user write directly in the output code. Unlike Refine, we enable our tool to continue to aid the developer beyond the initial scaffold phase, allowing things like the data model to update and the user gets new database migrations to be auto-generated and applied. We also make it really easy for anyone to create and share these application blueprints or generators (as we call them).<p>In this way, the user can select any mix of technology and make starterkits or addons for any application, not just webapps. For example we have users (ops team) injecting and maintaining CI &amp; k8s files into their service fleets (dev team).

They have lower conversion rates, require more support (they oftentimes ask us to teach them how to write JS), and have lower NPS.<p>Our target audience is the developer who doesn&#x27;t believe that building a simple form (that submits a POST request) should involve: 1) installing 30 dependencies, 2) learning a new framework, 3) spending hours researching the best table library, and 4) mucking around with redux trying to figure out how to get a spinny indicator on a button.<p>The state of web development today is _insane_, and we want developers focusing on being productive, instead of everything listed above.

I think we are both anchoring our tools around &quot;Retool for enterprise&quot; because Retool is known and it give a quick overview of the domain we are in: Internal tools, but the audience and pain solved by refine and windmill are likely to be quite different. 
Windmill caters towards software engineers that want to write powerful backend logic in typescript&#x2F;python&#x2F;bash&#x2F;go, long running jobs and complex workflows for internal use (we compete there with temporal, airflow, airplane), and share them with the rest of their orgs with all permissions handled for them, ability to scale on large clusters, and observability baked in (full history of all executions, including args, logs, and result) AND in addition have a low-code dashboard builder similar to retool because webhooks, schedules and automatically generated UI from scripts are not always sufficient.<p>Refine looks more like a headless retool for software engineers that are comfortable with frontend frameworks but want an opinionated stack that is tailored toward internal uses and do not want to deal with the rest of the boilerplate, user management, and connection&#x2F;management of databases etc. I could see myself preferring refine for some use-cases and would probably recommend it if you are comfortable with writing frontend and the logic is limited to CRUD. So I wish them good luck and I am happy to see such diversity in the open-source space!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

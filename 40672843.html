I&#x27;m fine with companies not using open source licenses, but this is a very odd way to do it. Licensing something under the GPL doesn&#x27;t work like this.<p>You should look at one of the existing non-open-source licenses like the Business Source License or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsl.software&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsl.software&#x2F;</a> rather than modifying the GPL by adding an extra paragraph at the top: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ask-fini&#x2F;paramount&#x2F;commit&#x2F;8345edd8f776572d98b3782fbbba447da4d19c6e">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ask-fini&#x2F;paramount&#x2F;commit&#x2F;8345edd8f776572...</a><p>Also, with a license like this it&#x27;s not accurate to say &quot;Paramount - an Open Source package...&quot; - that&#x27;s a misuse of the term.</div><br/><div id="40676248" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40676248" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nucleardog</span><span>|</span><a href="#40675943">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40676361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40676248">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40676248">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Licensing something under the GPL doesn&#x27;t work like this.<p>Sure it does! The GPL covers this exact scenario.<p>Section 7 enumerates the additional restrictions you may include alongside the license which will apply to any further distribution. Those are mostly around indemnification, trademarks, etc.<p>It explicitly says all other non-permissive additions are considered further restrictions and if the program says it is covered by GPL you may remove those terms.<p>(There’s also section 10, but we don’t need it.)<p>Since the README says this is “under GPL license for individuals”, and the GPL license says I can remove those terms… without even getting really far into the mud here, I can download a copy of the software, strip those restrictions, and repost it under the GPL sans restrictions for anyone to use.<p>That all said… it will probably have most of the intended effect. Individuals won’t care about the license much (may limit outside contributors), but no company is going to touch this with a ten foot pole with a hacked up GPL on it, &gt;100 employees or otherwise.</div><br/><div id="40677336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40677336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stackskipton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40675943">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40676248">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40676361">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40677336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40677336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except Section 7 has this embedded in it:<p>&gt;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option

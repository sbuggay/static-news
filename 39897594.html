But I wish he’d tell Python programmers to stop designing APIs where you write string constants like “r--” and “bs” to denote that your scatterplot should use red dashes and blue squares.<p>Intriguing. I assume the author would prefer a stronger-typed alternative like explicit parameters and enums. Yet I wonder if having a small DSL-like syntax is actually the better for a scripting language. Most of these plots will be hacked together in a local notebook anyway.<p>What would be a better alternative to this terse DSL in such case?</div><br/><div id="39900962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39900962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bckygldstn</span><span>|</span><a href="#39899655">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39900977">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39900962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39900962">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This line style API was included MATLAB[0] (and perhaps designed elsewhere earlier) in the Olden Days where terseness was both more necessary (due to space and performance constraints) and more accepted. MATLAB development started in the 60s, though this DSL was likely added in the 80s.<p>Later, Python&#x27;s matplotlib library started life as an emulator for MATLAB graphics in Python so naturally included the same plotting DSL.<p>Only later still did matplotlib morph into the defacto general Python plotting library. And then because plotting is so complex and matplotlib exposes so much control, most subsequent plotting libraries were based on matplotlib, opting to add value via high-level abstractions and better defaults, often exposing the underlying matplotlib objects to allow for fine-tweaking. And so the linestyle API leaks into those libraries too.<p>All of that to say, this DSL was likely invented by a scientist in a lab in 1981 and has survived through inertia and &quot;jumping hosts&quot; a couple times, rather than careful design.<p>I think the DSL is bad. And the matplotlib developers may agree, because while you can pass a combo like &quot;ro--&quot;, you can also pass these parameters separately and more descriptively like<p><pre><code>   color=&#x27;#f00&#x27;, linestyle=&#x27;dashed&#x27;, marker=matplotlib.markers.CARETDOWNBASE

But you can rebase the commits to group and squash them for review. Then you may choose to squash the entire PR when you rebase main onto it.<p>This has pros and cons. Let&#x27;s explore them after an example.<p>Scenario: Big &amp; Noisy PR<p>We have a PR with 13 commits :
3 fix commits, 5 refactors, 2 doc updates, a CI modification, 1 feature commit, 1 test update<p>The commits are in random order, and some of the commits are revisions to earlier commits. It&#x27;s hard to understand the narrative of the commits and review things accurately.<p>Solution Part 1: Tidy the PR<p>1. Reorder the commits by type and relevance:
3 fix -&gt; CI -&gt;5 refactor -&gt; 2 doc -&gt; test -&gt; feature.<p>2. Squash logically similar commits:
fix -&gt; CI -&gt; 2 refactor -&gt; doc -&gt; test -&gt; feature.<p>A squashed commit should have a bullet list detailing each changed module and scope of change:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Fix(package a): Fix a, b, c<p>This patch fixes:<p>* (module b): fix [...]<p>* (module c): fix [...]<p>* (module c): fix [...]<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>3. Review and CI the PR<p>4. Add commits needed to complete the PR<p>The tidied PR was easy to understand: We fixed some pre-existing issues, beefed up the ci, then set the stage for the feature. The feature itself was clear and simple.<p>If you do just this, your history will be much cleaner.<p>Now I&#x27;m going to recommend something controversial:<p>Solution Part 2:  Squash-rebase the PR onto main<p>Yup. Take all that work and mash it together. The final commit message should look clean and detailed:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Big Shiny Feature<p>This patch implements  [...]<p>Feat:<p>* (module d): Implement big shiny feature<p>Doc:<p>* (readme): update feature list<p>* (userguide): add tutorial for feature<p>CI:<p>* (workflow a): modify [...]<p>Fixes:<p>* (module b): fix [...]<p>* (module c): fix [...]<p>* (module c): fix [...]<p>Refactor:<p>* (module a): rename [...]<p>* (module b): delete unused [...]<p>[...]<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Benefits:
-  We drop 7x fewer commits onto Main
- Project history is more legible
- Commit messages are detailed and useful
- Bisecting takes log 7 = 2.8 fewer steps<p>Risks:
- File diffs can be illegible if feature work intersects with refactor or fix work 
- There are 7x more defects per commit
- It is harder to uncover root cause if we bisect<p>Conclussion<p>Tidying PRs before review is a no brainer - it greatly improves our review and history.<p>Squashing PRs onto main loses some information, but can make history easier to navigate. Since we&#x27;re disciplined and detailed in our commit messages, this is often much less of a footgun than it might seem. Each commit is now a logical and self-contained unit.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39898580" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39898580" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hn_user82179</span><span>|</span><a href="#39898746">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39898566">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39898580">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39898580">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good review, I enjoyed it.

Deadlines at a tax company are always going to be worse than one with no high and low periods. Missing a back to school launch in edtech is going to be catastrophic, and I&#x27;d rather know sooner than later so that we can pull things out of the release.<p>In the massive integration days, everyone had already done most of the work and there were a lot of pieces that were 70% complete, and the integration dependencies made it brutally difficult to pull something out of a release.

Let&#x27;s go back to the 2000 edition.<p>&quot;Each project phase is marked by completion of one or more deliverables. A deliverable is a tangible, verifiable work product such as a feasibility study, a detail design, or a working prototype. The deliverables, and hence the phases, are part of a generally sequential logic designed to ensure proper definition of the product of the project.&quot;<p>2.1 and 2.2 talk about waterfall and spiral before heading into stakeholder management. It follows through the entire system - consider what integrated change control looked like in those days. It&#x27;s all things we take for granted now - when was the last time you had to write a design doc that was longer than 2 pages? When was the last time you got in a room to hash out and negotiate scope for a year of work? It&#x27;s truly brutal!<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t to say I love Scrum. I agree that if you are letting your metrics get in the way of your work then you&#x27;ve done the exact wrong thing. If you know you need to start building your model early then you start building your model early. If you aren&#x27;t paying attention to your dependencies, then the process has failed and maybe you jump to something else.<p>I&#x27;m not even saying there are no flaws in agile, Scrum or otherwise!

You could hack a more useful Copilot with AutoHotkey, today.<p>I have GPT-4o hooked up as a voice assistant via Home Assistant, and what a breeze that is. Sure, every interaction costs me some $0.03 due to inefficient use of context (HA generates too much noise by default in its map of available devices and their state), but I can walk around the house and turn devices on and off by casually chatting with my watch, and it work, works well, and works faster than it takes to turn on Google Assistant.<p>So no, I honestly don&#x27;t think AI advances are oversold.

There is very obviously a marketing phenomenon happening now where “AI” is being added to the name of every product. Not because it’s actually AI in any rigorous or historical sense of the word, but because it’s trendy and helps you get investment dollars.<p>I think one of the results of this is that the concept of AI itself increasingly becomes more muddled until it becomes indistinguishable from a word like “technology” and therefore useless for describing a particular phenomenon. You can already see this with the usage of “AGI” and “super intelligence” which from the definitions I’ve been reading, are not the same thing at all. AGI is&#x2F;was supposed to be about achieving results of the average human being, not about a sci-fi AI god, and yet it seems like everyone is using them interchangeably. It’s very sloppy thinking.<p>Instead I think the term AI is going to slowly become less marketing trendy, and will fade out over time, as all trendy marketing terms do. What will be left are actually useful enhancements to specific use cases - most of which will probably be referred to by a word other than AI.</div><br/><div id="40735584" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40735584" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">surfingdino</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40734861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40735584">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40735584">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Couldn&#x27;t agree more.

That evolution is ongoing as we discover more about ourselves and the world we live in, refine our knowledge, disprove old assumptions and theories and, on occasion, admit that we were wrong to dismiss them. Also, over time, we place different levels of importance to knowledge from the past. For example, an old alchemy manual from the middle ages used to record recipes for a cure for some nasty disease was important because it helped whoever had access to it quickly prepare some ointment that sometimes worked, but today we know that most of those recipes were random, non-scientific attempts at coming up with a solution to a medical problem and we have proven that those medicines do not work. Therefore, the importance of the old alchemist&#x27;s recipe book as a source of scientific truth has gone to zero, but the historic importance of it has grown a lot, because it helps us understand how our knowledge of chemistry and its applications in health care has evolved. LLMs treat all text as equal unless it will be given hints. But those hints are provided by humans, so there is an inherent bias and the best we can hope for is that those hints are correct at the time of training. We are not pursuing AGI, we are pursuing the goal of automating the process of creation of answers that look like they are the right answers to the given question, but without much attention to factual, logical, or contextual correctness.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40735723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40735723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ben_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40735577">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736167">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40735723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40735723">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">GPT-3 is about the same complexity as a mouse brain; it did better than I expected…<p>… but it&#x27;s still a brain the size of a mouse&#x27;s.</div><br/><div id="40736107" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736107" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dgb23</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40735723">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736107">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736107">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mice are fare more impressive though.</div><br/><div id="40736336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ben_w</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve yet to see a mouse write even mediocre python, let alone a rap song about life in ancient Athens written in Latin.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, organic brains learn from far fewer examples than AI, there&#x27;s a lot organic brains can do that AI don&#x27;t (yet), but I don&#x27;t really find the intellectual capacity of mice to be particularly interesting.<p>On the other hand, the question of if mice have qualia, that is something I find interesting.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40736172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">surfingdino</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736107">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736336">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736112">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736172">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And they can cook.

There is very obviously a marketing phenomenon happening now where “AI” is being added to the name of every product. Not because it’s actually AI in any rigorous or historical sense of the word, but because it’s trendy and helps you get investment dollars.<p>I was reading one famous book about investing some times ago (I don&#x27;t remember which one exactly, I think it was a random walk into wall st, but don&#x27;t quote me on that) and one chapter at the beginning of the book talk about the .com bubble and how companies, even ones who had nothing to do with the web, started to put .com or www in their name and were seeing an immediate bump in their stock price (until it all burst, as we know now).<p>And every hype cycle &#x2F; bubble is like that. We saw something similar with cryptocurrencies. For a while, every tech demos at dev convention had to have some relation to the &quot;blockchain&quot;. We saw every variation of names ending in -coin. And a lot of company, that where not even in tech, had dumb project related to the blockchain, which for anyone slightly knowledgeable with the tech it was clear that it was complete BS, and they almost all the time were quietly killed off after a few month.<p>To a much lesser extent, we saw the same with &quot;BigData&quot; (who even use this word anymore?) and AR&#x2F;VR&#x2F;XR.<p>And now its AI, until the next recession and&#x2F;or the next shiny thing that makes for amazing demos pops-out.<p>It is not to say that it is all fake. There is always some genuine business that have actual use case with the tech and will probably survive the burst (or get brought up and live on has MS&#x2F;Google&#x2F;AWS Thingamajig). But you have to be pretty naïve if you think 99% of the current AI company will live in the next 5 years, and believe their marketing material. But it doesn&#x27;t matter if you manage to sell before the bubble pop, and so the cycle continue.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40736227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mdp2021</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736252">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40735976">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736227">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>AGI is&#x2F;was supposed to be about achieving results of the average human being, not about a sci-fi AI god</i><p>When we build something we do not intend to build something that just achieves results «of the average human being», and a slow car, a weak crane, a vague clock are built provisionally in the process of achieving the superior aid intended...

And a sure way to realize you don&#x27;t know is to try yourself and fail.<p>¹ I had to think about my childhood friend, whose esotheric mother died of a preventable disease, because she fooled herself into believing into magical cures and gurus until the fatal end.</div><br/><div id="40736412" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736412" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40735804">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736412">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736412">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That is funny, because of all the problems with LLMs, the biggest one is that they will lie&#x2F;hallucinate&#x2F;confabulate to your face before saying I don&#x27;t know, much like those leaders.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40735804" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40735804" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">davidgerard</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736008">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40734924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40735804">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40735804">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; was marketing from its creation.

We think people who work hard and come up with good ideas should become successful. 
But usually working &#x27;within the system&#x27; limits your ability to be succesful. If you save the day at your current job, you might get a 20% raise if you&#x27;re lucky. If you are mediocre but change jobs often, you will probably beat that.<p>In software, getting a high paying job usually hinges on your ability to get someone willing to pay you a lot of money.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are people who are getting paid 10x more or less for doing work that is fundamentally the same, just with different presentation.<p>For example I know a guy who&#x27;s a mediocre PHP dev, but managed to snag a couple of high paying clients, and got into OE over covid, and brings in a ton of money, despite the fact that somehow he still doesn&#x27;t seem to be working that hard.<p>Does he deserve that money?

More and more, the accusation of being angry specifically seems to be all people think they need to say to smugly claim to be speaking from a &quot;rational&quot; high ground, often despite having contributed nothing of substance to the topic at hand. Like pointing out that this person&#x27;s blog post aimed at no one particular person did not really have to contend with the perception that this person was going to actually become violent at anyone, although actually I could see getting that impression from this post more than most, since it frequently explained the anger as cartoonish threats of hypothetical violence.

*Thoughts on AI Innovations*
Published on June 19, 2024<p>The recent advancements in AI, particularly with models like GPT-4, have significant implications for society. These range from potentially eliminating tedious tasks to raising concerns about the livelihoods of artists and even existential risks to humanity.<p>As someone with formal training as a data scientist, who has excelled in competitive machine learning events and authored a Master&#x27;s thesis by creating custom libraries in MATLAB, I have some perspective on the field. While I&#x27;m not claiming to be the best, I believe my experience gives me some authority on the subject.<p>It is concerning to see the rampant enthusiasm for AI deployment, often without a clear understanding of its limitations and appropriate use cases. The AI landscape is filled with hype, leading many to push for AI initiatives without fully grasping the complexities involved.<p>During my time as a data scientist, I noticed that many leaders lacked a deep understanding of the technology they promoted. This led to numerous AI projects being launched without practical applications, driven more by a desire to ride the wave of AI hype than by a genuine need or strategy. Consequently, many companies invested heavily in AI without seeing significant returns.<p>I&#x27;ve since transitioned to data and software engineering, finding more stability and meaningful work. Unlike those chasing AI trends, we focus on building reliable systems and fostering genuine professional relationships.<p>The AI field has seen many initiatives fail, yet the hype continues. This disconnect is troubling, as it often leads to resources being wasted on projects with little chance of success. A more pragmatic approach would involve improving foundational systems and processes before diving into sophisticated AI technologies.<p>AI does have the potential to revolutionize various industries, but its implementation should be thoughtful and driven by clear, achievable goals. Many organizations struggle with basic IT operations, making it unrealistic to expect them to successfully deploy advanced AI solutions.<p>In summary, while AI can offer significant benefits, it is crucial to approach its integration with caution, ensuring that foundational issues are addressed first. The focus should be on solving real problems and improving operational efficiency rather than chasing the latest technological trends.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40735286" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40735286" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajkjk</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736501">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40734748">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40735286">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40735286">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Love the tone and the comments, personally.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40734748" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40734748" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oofbey</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40735286">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736052">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40734748">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40734748">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I abhor the style and disagree with most of their comments.</div><br/><div id="40734880" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40734880" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dang</span><span>|</span><a href="#40734544">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40734748">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736052">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40734880">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40734880">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You deserve credit for saying that so even-keeledly.

But as an end user I can say that this is wrong. I definitely need LLMs for one critical thing: search that works.<p>Google has become clogged with outright spam and endless layers of indirection (useless sites that point to things that point to things that point to things, never getting me to the information that actually fucking matters), but I can ask the best LLMs queries like &quot;what&#x27;s the abc that does xyz in the context of ijk&quot; and get meaningful answers. It only works well when the subject has a lot of &quot;coverage&quot; (a lot of well-trodden ground, nothing cutting-edge) but that&#x27;s 80% of what I need.<p>I still have to check that the LLM found a real needle in the haystack rather than making up a bullshit one. (Ironically, Google works great for that once you know what the candidate needle actually is—it just sucks at finding any needle, even a hallucinated one, in the first place.) For shortest path from question to answer, LLMs are state of the art right now. They&#x27;re not only kicking Google&#x27;s ass, they&#x27;re the first major improvement in search since Google showed up 20+ years ago.<p>Therefore I think this author is high on his own fumes. It reminds me of the dotcom period: yeah there was endless stupid hype and cringey grifters and yeah there were excellent rants about how stupid and craven it all was—but the internet really did change everything in the end.

The LLM tended to produce something I&#x27;d call a reasonable answer, especially on topics that weren&#x27;t completely obscure.<p>But we don&#x27;t even need to go that deep to answer the question. For example, if an LLM was pure search, you couldn&#x27;t make one generate text in some specific style or with specific constraints, unless that exact answer already existed somewhere on the internet. They can mash up ideas or topics, and still output good or reasonable data.<p>The billion dollar question isn&#x27;t whether it&#x27;s generative - it&#x27;s whether the generative capabilities are &quot;enough&quot;.

Based on my experience as a tech entrepreneur with edu-focused products across multiple startups and decades, scaling sales revenue to significant levels in edu is extremely challenging for unique and non-obvious reasons. None of the edu-specific challenges are directly related to the effectiveness or relative value of the product itself. They are structural problems related to the three main types of buyers, which are: 1. Schools, (K-12, Univ), 2. Companies (employee training, compliance, etc), 3. Individuals (self-learners). There are other types of buyers but they don&#x27;t represent nearly as much aggregated potential revenue as these three. Note that these are the economic buyers not the product end-users.<p>Each of the three types presents different challenges from the others, however there recurring meta-themes. The main one is that their purchasing decisions are often driven by factors unrelated to the product. For example, the primary focus of schools is, sadly, not maximizing net student learning. While that is a consideration, it&#x27;s swamped by other external requirements, many of them wickedly complex. For companies, employee training, whether a regulatory requirement or purely to increase employee effectiveness, isn&#x27;t core to their actual business - meaning it&#x27;s a cost not revenue. Individuals on the other hand break into two types, those doing it to actually learn something for themselves, and those seeking certification or external validation like a degree to increase their future employment earnings. Learning lovers are a pure consumer, non-essential, discretionary spending-type sale with all the same well-known LTV and customer acquisition cost challenges. For certification&#x2F;validation buyers, they aren&#x27;t <i>primarily</i> focused on the learning but rather checking a particular box that has high perceived value to external parties.<p>While I agree that creating a new large and growing type of customer in addition to these three is possible, it&#x27;s a huge lift that&#x27;s risky, expensive and will require substantial sustained investment over time - all ahead of meaningful revenue. So, I wish Andrej et al the best and I&#x27;m rooting for them but I&#x27;m not optimistic they&#x27;ll build a high-growth, high-revenue sustainable edu business around AI as the primary value differentiation.</div><br/><div id="40982632" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40982632" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zamfi</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981844">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40982632">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40982632">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s true that these markets are the huge ones today.<p>But there is another buyer that your post leaves out: parents. This is not the same as individuals&#x2F;self-learners (the buyer is not the user, exactly) — but the buyer has strong incentives that align with student performance that are different than the others.<p>Historically, this has been a very challenging market to scale up well — exceptional 1:1 tutors are rare, and hard to train, they’ll be expensive and often form a relationship with their tutees that incentivizes disintermediation of any platform that tries to capture some fraction of the value by offering a two-sided marketplace (YC has funded at least one of these!)<p>However, AI has the potential to dominate in this market. Most tutors are actually not amazing, but 1:1 tutoring is just so much more effective than basically any other kind of educational context (two-sigma improvements!) that it doesn’t super matter. AI <i>could</i> be a much more effective tutor — at a cost substantially lower than a human tutor. Of course, wealthy families may still want to hire the well-pedigreed, role-model-level, truly exceptional tutors. But folks who are lukewarm about their private (or small-group) tutors may just give the AI tutors a shot—and find that they’re better than what they were paying for.<p>Or not! That’s what makes it a risky bet. :)<p>But it’s a large, $50B+ market today, and growing fast — not one to be discounted.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40983487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40983487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rkuska</span><span>|</span><a href="#40981844">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40982632">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40983491">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40983487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40983487">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; So, I wish Andrej et al the best and I&#x27;m rooting for them but I&#x27;m not optimistic they&#x27;ll build a high-growth, high-revenue sustainable edu business around AI as the primary value differentiation.<p>I don’t have an X account and as such might miss additional information from subsequent replies but there is nowhere in the post mention about building a high growth&#x2F;high revenue business?

I am also building a learning platform as potential lifestyle business, having been a user of such platforms and worked in large corporate I fully understand that the groups you identify are absolutely true. One important point is that you can make successful business helping people prepare for the certificates without being the issuing party - not VC level, but still. This way you can cover some of the checkbox checkers and self-motivated learners at the same time.<p>Self motivated learners who will be willing to pay you can also be groupped in a few groups - the ones seeking future employment in tech sector, looking to understand the technology better and showcase it on their resume with some projects that your platform will allow them to complete and ones doing this purely for fun or to keep up, I believe the latter group is very small.<p>Platform alone, even with tons of learning materials will not be enough to get this off the ground, you will either need to leverage your existing audience, bringing us back to the fact that everything is an attention economy now, or, you&#x27;ll need to be very advertisement heavy on YouTube, which you can bruteforce with VC investment, see skillshare for example. NordVPN took off the same bruteforce way, although in a different product category.<p>My platform will combine technical learning with in-material challenges, sort of a sprinkled leetcode if you will.

What terrifies me is the idea that being born to slightly different parents or in a slightly different area could have had drastic effects on my outcome. I believe we should make policy decisions assuming any one of us could have been born to the poorest and most negligent parents imaginable. Making any other assumption is being dishonest about the benefits afforded to you by your upbringing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40981595" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981595" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brezelgoring</span><span>|</span><a href="#40979306">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40980807">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40982036">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981595">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981595">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Are you interested in living in a malthusian nightmare?<p>Some of them live in such an environment already.

Some of them live in an environment where you can rely only on yourself, requesting help is seen as weak victim-like behavior, but giving out for free is worse - detrimental because that other person might see what you&#x27;re doing and take credit for or steal your work; some say helping another with your skills&#x2F;time and not charging money is peak cuck behavior, and some of the more organized (I&#x27;d like to say &#x27;coeficient-driven&#x27;) members of our community really believe that money is the greatest measurement tool ever invented and we should measure everything with it, including a person&#x27;s worth.<p>That being said, generalizing is bad and there really are some truly golden individuals here who have done humanity a net benefit while charging nothing for their work.

The pandemic showed us exactly what children would prefer to do, when they don&#x27;t have a physical teacher standing over them, which is bugger all. We send kids to school, in the hope they get some education, but the reality is that we use schools for free childcare while we work. If parents have to additionally monitor their child&#x27;s learning, it breaks down pretty quickly.<p>I see AI being more of a teaching assistant, rather than a replacement for teachers.

There is an uncanny valley in communication where any inconsistent distortion of reflected appraisal can lead students down a path of irrational madness, in a way that they themselves cannot perceive. This is well known in certain circles.<p>AI always has the biases which are programmed into it by the creators of the AI, whether this is explicit or implicit, the fact remains, there are biases.<p>AI in education will be proven to be harmful because there is no possible way that AI can remain consistent in its interactions at all times. We already know this from hallucinations where experts went and fact checked it and found it had lied, where lawyers were disbarred or censured.<p>Put plainly, this is a safety critical system involving our children.<p>Given the level of care to date that&#x27;s occurred with AI in industry, there is no room for discussion or adoption of these tools, unless the actual unspoken intention is to drive your children crazy; where they self eliminate later as a result.<p>Rationally, good people don&#x27;t create a world of intolerable suffering and then magically expect that somehow, someone, will figure out a way to fix everything you&#x27;ve broken but were too blind to see; at the time when knowing would save lives.<p>For those who enjoy cinema, a perfect analogy of this might be the Day After Tomorrow, where the main scientist turns out to be correct, but was ultimately ignored until devastating losses and risks were nearly insurmountable.<p>Leadership didn&#x27;t want to hear the facts when knowing would have saved lives, and so they had to take a triage on the battlefield approach (abandoning half the country).

This is just to get you started (as an overview), with the least amount of ambiguity.<p>Torture induces vulnerable mental states which can create lasting changes in combination with a little knowledge of our (humanities) psychology.<p>I believe Cialdini covers the other lever&#x27;s of influence in his book on Influence.  These can all be used in any perceived communications system. He directly mentions PoW camps in his chapter on Consistency (with a lot of additional references).<p>Most modern documented cases of torture involve mental coercion, absent most physical coercion. This may take the form of varying and intermittent loud noises, bright lights (meant to disorient and confuse), isolation, sleep deprivation, etc which are intended to induce hypnotic states. There may also be covert hypnosis techniques that can be used as well, not excluding modern pharmacology derivatives based in narco-analysis (which during WW2 were known to not be effective), or drug dependency (not related to the current discussion).<p>The subject may become psychotic&#x2F;violent, or withdraw (disassociate) becoming non-responsive, from extended exposure to mental coercion. Only a very rare few may be cursory unaffected (but still be hallowed out somewhat). Largely this is just a function of time and exposure.<p>In many cases all cohorts will to a degree adopt characteristics of their torturer (through distorted reflected appraisal), or whatever they promote (towards the promise or hope of relief, which is not physical relief).<p>Additionally, this material also includes the process of breaking down an individuals self-concept. As an example through destructive interference, by forcing the subject into acts that violate their deeply held beliefs, Abu Ghraib comes to mind, an example might be subscribing deeply to jewish traditions, and then being fed meat in your food without your knowledge (until later) where invectives and humiliation are induced. Overall, this subject matter is some of the darkest evil stuff you&#x27;d ever want to know, but it is entirely necessary to know in order to recognize and put a stop to it.<p>Most people don&#x27;t recognize how evil works in reality, it works through willful blindness, and continues until its stopped, and perception requires you to not be blind to alert to that fact. Those who have blinded themselves are incapable of stopping.<p>Many of these structures, tactics, and techniques that originate in torture, form the basis for what is used today very commonly in advertising and marketing, as well as subversion and propaganda.<p>The reality is its fairly simple to break people with certain structures. One such structure is prompting for confession to induce consistency traps, then using that to mold the person to a certain narrative in a circular loop.<p>The use of the hot potato in the classroom, for open-ended questions (opinion) is one such example where this material has found purchase in K12 education.<p>Often, these elements are subtle, and are non-alerting; but demonstrably effective. What I&#x27;ve mentioned is just scratching the surface.<p>Edit: on a side note:<p>There is an interesting, and somewhat convincing argument to be made in this area related to active shooters. It may be that these related crimes may in some part be linked to the mental coercive spirals that are regularly being induced in our population. Bullying, Harassment and &#x27;Silencing&#x27;&#x2F;Shunning, and Discrimination (of any kind) for example are forms of social (mental) coercion.<p>While it is not a causal link, nor does it excuse any outcomes (which are unjustifiable, and worthy of condemnation). It is certainly plausible given the background knowledge in this subject area and some basic a priori reasoning.<p>Inducements through ads, and other isolating tactics may be ephemeral data that is not collected.<p>Given the risks, it certainly should merit much further scientific investigation and funding than it currently receives. It is well known that tortured people eventually break.<p>For simple lookup (Author&#x2F;ISBN):

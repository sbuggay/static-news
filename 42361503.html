This name was coined by economist Horst Siebert based on an anecdote taken from the British Raj. The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. The cobra breeders set their snakes free, leading to an overall increase in the wild cobra population.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cobra_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cobra_effect</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42362552" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42362552" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">redwall_hp</span><span>|</span><a href="#42362466">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362694">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42362552">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42362552">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They should all receive the same sentence as someone they arrested for making and selling crack cocaine would.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42362507" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42362507" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robjwells</span><span>|</span><a href="#42362466">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362552">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42362507">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42362507">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Everybody involved in this should get fired.<p>I don’t disagree but the events in question took place and were discovered over 30 years ago. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upi.com&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;1992&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;Appeals-court-Sheriffs-cocaine-lab-illegal&#x2F;1267694501200&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upi.com&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;1992&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;Appeals-court-Sherif...</a></div><br/><div id="42362753" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42362753" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boringg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42362466">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362507">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362912">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42362753">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42362753">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Id agree -- it is crazy but this is 30 years ago..<p>For those still impacted thats a problem.

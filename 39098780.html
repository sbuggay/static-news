It is racist to believe that one race is superior to another and act accordingly.  For example, it is not racist to acknowledge the frequently measured metric that African Americans on average score lower than other races on scholastic aptitude tests.  It is what one does with that observation that can lead to racism.<p>It is useful to define terms.  Merriam-Webster has what I believe is a quite useful definition of racism: &quot;a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race&quot;.<p>That is a useful definition because it helps to separate a racist interpretation of test scores from a non-racist interpretation.  The racist interpretation is to jump to a conclusion of fundamental inferiority in academics.  The non-racist interpretation is to acknowledge and emphasize the environmental factors that can lead an historically oppressed&#x2F;displaced&#x2F;enslaved minority to underperform academically, to acknowledge that African-born immigrants do quite well on standardized testing, and also to understand that standardized tests are normed on academic success, which creates a causality issue when measuring groups that have historically not been allowed in academic institutions.  Perhaps all of those arguments don&#x27;t hold water: or at least the pitcher holding them has holes of its own.  But it is quite erroneous to jump to a conclusion of racial biological determinism, and that is what the racist conclusion would be.<p>There is a particular kind of fallacy where a person can, seemingly unconsciously, take what are perfectly valid observations, like the test-taking disparities, and spin them into non-evidential overarching beliefs.  This happens all too commonly when it comes to scientific (or at least metrical) observations and racism.  People were all too eager to embrace phrenology, IQ testing, evolutionary biology, etc. when it confirmed their cultural preconception that their race was superior.  All of those areas, even phrenology, had some scientific merit to them (and still do in the case of IQ testing and evolutionary biology), but that merit is lost when the conclusions get spun into non-evidential belief systems like racist ideology.  Seemingly (I can&#x27;t peer into their heads, really) skepticism is lost in a chase for the personal gratification of a belief of fundamental superiority.<p>Discussions around academic standards are a case in point.  Academic standards change quite frequently.  The Oregon requirement we&#x27;re discussing was only instituted in the early 2010&#x27;s.  When race is not part of the discussion, it is entirely normal for educators to say that a new standardized test doesn&#x27;t really have evidence it serves the population and to remove it. There is a very lively debate amongst educators about how excessive measurement, i.e. standardized test taking, can interfere with the normal give-and-take of teaching.  But, if the evidence is that non-native-English speakers are underserved, or that African-Americans are underserved, suddenly it is &#x27;racist&#x27; to remove a requirement or hurdle.  What I saw in the two articles is that those in favor of removing the requirement saw a lack of evidence it was beneficial, and saw evidence that it was not beneficial; while those opposed had no evidence other than it would graduate &#x27;dumber&#x27; students; ignoring the fact that presumably dumber students were being graduated before the 2010&#x27;s when the program was instituted.<p>In short, it is often a smokescreen to say that observations about race are racist, because that makes it impossible to act against inequality, or sometimes even to act at all.  Once again, racism is the belief of one race&#x27;s inherent superiority over another.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39099844" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39099844" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daseiner1</span><span>|</span><a href="#39099427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39099807">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39100000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39099606">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39099844">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39099844">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Welcome to the world of striving for equity over equality.<p>Lots of blame levied at a strawman white culture.

I don&#x27;t think the snark helps.<p>Not my field, but my understanding of how these things work in big medical research factories: first few authors tend to be young researchers (maybe med students or even undergrads) trying to match residency or get into grad school. They do much of the work actually assembling the submission. The later names on the author list (who this article is taking to task) run labs or oversee research groups. Should they correct the record when it&#x27;s pointed out? Yes. (But the snark and tenor of the post doesn&#x27;t exactly convince someone they can admit an oversight in good faith.)<p>Should they be vigilant enough to check and notice these things? Of course. Some of the fakes are not subtle. Others, like the copy-paste of empty space in the lane to cover some undesirable result? Way harder to spot with the naked eye. I don&#x27;t think there was great automated tech to detect image duplication in the 00&#x27;s when these were published.<p>So your med student fudges data on a paper. The ethical answer is to expel them—&quot;the world needs plenty of bartenders.&quot; But it appears big institutions these days are pretty invested in the sunk costs of prestige, dislike admitting error in admission or hiring, and prioritize go-along-get-along environments. It could be career limiting if students don&#x27;t get any&#x2F;enough pubs working in your lab. It&#x27;d a lot of hearings and paperwork to report him, plus I heard his uncle&#x27;s a donor. If she got kicked out she&#x27;d lose her visa. And if I reported them, I&#x27;d be obliged to report everyone, and I&#x27;d be sunk in discipline hearings three times a year. So much easier to just... not look very hard.<p>It&#x27;s bad science and bad ethics, but if you want better, reform the incentives. &quot;Public&quot; shaming by a niche newsletter... might be better than nothing, but doesn&#x27;t qualify as an incentive.</div><br/><div id="39099879" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39099879" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wrs</span><span>|</span><a href="#39099597">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39099820">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39099894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39099879">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39099879">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They won&#x27;t correct the record because they &quot;can&#x27;t admit an oversight&quot; due to the snark in a niche newsletter...a newsletter which you then say isn&#x27;t important enough to serve as an incentive?

The snark plays to individual psychology in the moment. When someone comes at you in a way that&#x27;s demeaning and clearly states that they think you shouldn&#x27;t have the position you have, that&#x27;s a bad way to start a conversation where you&#x27;re supposed to admit error. More likely, you avoid them.<p>To the real brass tacks incentives: yeah, it&#x27;s &quot;someone is angry on the internet&quot; vs, &quot;I will have to deal with a discipline process with documentation and meetings and maybe depositions and adversarial lawyers. That&#x27;s not my bag, I&#x27;m a scientist. There will be volatile young people and bad feelings communicated in person, plus gossip among my close coworkers. Also undesirable. If this becomes a repeated pattern, learners might start avoiding my lab, and deans&#x2F;my superiors might start asking very awkward questions.&quot; Yeah, stacked against that, angry person on the internet is a weak incentive. Even if they&#x27;re right.<p>And the snark does matter. Because this guy writes like a YouTube comments section, and that&#x27;s not how you talk to adults or solve problems in elite institutions. So the contrast in styles draws lines of &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them.&quot; And it&#x27;s natural to care more about the opinions and esteem of your in-group (who talk like you) than the out-group (who deride you).</div><br/><div id="39100765" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39100765" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boxed</span><span>|</span><a href="#39099597">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39099998">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39099894">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39100765">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39100765">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the snark comes from having screamed about the situation for years and years and no one listening.<p>Let&#x27;s all remember what we are talking about here: every single one of us will know someone who will die several years early because of scientific fraud.

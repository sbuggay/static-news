I don&#x27;t even know whether it would be possible to write an exploit that overflows something in an external ABI binary in Rust without sacrificing everything that Rust stands for. After all, the binary would have to be statically linked for deployment, have to support invalid types, have to support invalid control flows etc.<p>On the other hand, in Go that&#x27;s what CGo is made for. The VM and GC in Go doesn&#x27;t care about what CGo does.<p>Edit: nevermind, the only example that is using Rust for this type of exploits is a sudo cli argument exploit, lol. I would have expected a little more than a char array generator that&#x27;s using the FFI package.

It doesn&#x27;t have many established libraries&#x2F;frameworks compared to other languages, so &quot;I wrote X but Rust&quot; is a viable thing. In other languages, this wouldn&#x27;t stand because there are already established libraries so interest in new ones is not as high + there are certain quality standards you have to meet.<p>5. It has certain high-profile features which are easy to explain why they are better - option types and slices for example. These Rustaceans are usually not exposed to functional programming before - so they start to embrace simple forms of functional programming. It makes Rust programs look fairly different compared to similar languages, which is another differentiator.

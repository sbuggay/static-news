Live performances have physical and temporal limitations that books and movies don&#x27;t, and are often divided into acts and scenes in order to overcome these limitations. The stage is rearranged between acts, the performers grab a glass of water, while the audience has time to go pee.<p>The Homeric epics are divided into 24 &quot;books&quot; each, one for each letter of the Greek alphabet. The size of those books makes them feel very much like the chapters of a modern novel. It is said that the divisions were not made by Homer himself. One could easily imagine his students using some convenient unit to refer to parts of the poem: &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s perform scroll no. 16 tonight!&quot; &quot;Have you memorized no. 2 yet?&quot;<p>Some of the more play-like books of the Old Testament, such as Esther, also lend themselves naturally to divisions between scenes. The deliberate context switches leave the audience anxious about what will happen next, just like modern shows often end in a cliffhanger to make the viewer return for another episode. Not surprisingly, medieval priests who assigned chapters to the Bible preserved many of these natural breakpoints.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38470669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38470669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drewcoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38470934">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38470669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38470669">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; No one before Dames seems to have asked where this ancient and deeply established convention came from, or how it spread<p>That&#x27;s odd. In the 90s I took a college course called History of the Book and I distinctly remember talking about chapters. I also remember talking about them in several medieval history classes, where we talked about how information and art and letter styles spread, too.<p>Maybe Nicholas Dames is a time traveler!</div><br/><div id="38470811" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38470811" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">readthenotes1</span><span>|</span><a href="#38470669">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38470811">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38470811">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m looking forward to the prequel, where he is the first to ask about punctuation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

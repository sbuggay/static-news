My experience with my laptops is that windows will arbitrarily use 2-3x idle power draw while on battery for no apparent reason. There is no reason for a CPU to be running higher than idle the vast majority of the time in a laptop, for tasks that you would be using a laptop for on battery.<p>I think most laptops are just poorly designed and Windows isn&#x27;t reliable about using minimal power. MFGs make big laptops with 60whr batteries (instead of 100wh), they put bloatware on them that consume excess power at idle, MS Windows doesn&#x27;t reliably ensure low power consumption on battery (seriously, I have to hibernate&#x2F;shut down my laptop when I stop using it, otherwise it will consume its entire battery in 8hrs during sleep mode, somehow), and so on. Most problems with Windows laptops aren&#x27;t Intel&#x27;s fault, IMO.<p>I agree that Intel really should clarify, at least, the difference between their &quot;Celeron&quot; class (e-core only) and &quot;Core&quot; class processors (with P cores), since there&#x27;s such a massive difference in performance capability between them.</div><br/><div id="41199160" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41199160" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WalterBright</span><span>|</span><a href="#41195300">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199048">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41199412">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41199160">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41199160">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There is no reason for a CPU to be running higher than idle the vast majority of the time in a laptop, for tasks that you would be using a laptop for on battery.<p>True.

Even if their public roadmap has shown all the time that they will continue to have big losses for at least one more year, that was obvious only for technical people, who could compare the future Intel products with the AMD products, because Intel has not said any word in their roadmap about what the competition will have at the same time.

This is a bigger difference than I expected, admittedly, though the gap closes if you care about multicore performance numbers.<p>Here in AU, a 16GB air with 512GB SSD = 2400AUD.

It also happened to be the cheapest laptop with a new Meteor lake processor I could find, though I&#x27;d have to imagine there are laptops with worse specifications in other areas for the cheaper.<p>You can obviously spend up from there to improve build quality, get more SSD space (probably by swapping out the stock NVMe drive), more RAM (if you&#x27;re lucky maybe they have SODIMMs, though I&#x27;d guess most laptops, especially non-16&quot;, might have soldered memory).<p>In terms of non-savvy vs savvy, mostly it&#x27;s that a non-savvy laptop buyer, generally speaking, doesn&#x27;t understand:<p>- Screen quality&#x2F;tech. Resolution, TN vs IPS vs OLED, matte vs gloss, maximum brightness<p>- How different processor generations compare. Especially walking into a store, it&#x27;s common in my experience for laptops with 5500u (Zen 2 6 core) to be sitting next to a laptop with a new eg. 125H, both at similar prices. The newer processor is the pick (performance wise), but this is completely nonobvious. It&#x27;s particularly bad at lower specs, where you can have an i3 N300 (8 e cores) next to perhaps a Ryzen 5700u or Intel 13600h...<p>In theory salespeople should lead them in the right direction, but likely as not they can spend twice as much on a fancy laptop that looks schmick (and probably is) when they could get 90% of the same experience with something like the Acer above. eg:

Why should it be able to break into other competitive markets today when it no longer has those advantages?<p>Maybe because you&#x27;re looking at it backwards? There must be some conspiracy among Softbank investors to portray everyone that doesn&#x27;t pay for ARM licenses as a Muppet. Intel has no competitive advantage manufacturing licensed RISC CPUs when their desktop and server markets are hot, and even when x86 dies it will still be less attractive than owning fabs. With how bad the Cortex designs continue to be and how much leeway ARM gives licensees like Apple, even businesses like Qualcomm can&#x27;t be bothered to take the ISA seriously. It feels disingenuous to say ARM is the panacea when designing ARM cores would have left Intel in an even worse position.<p>Look at Samsung; a company people on this site would describe as misery incarnate, but chances are they&#x27;re typing their comment from a device using Samsung-fabbed silicon. They&#x27;re not even that competitive either; they just offer a cheap alternative to TSMC that offers OEMs an economically-minded option for less dense components.</div><br/><div id="41196498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41196498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">klelatti</span><span>|</span><a href="#41196336">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41196498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41196498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; It feels disingenuous to say ARM is the panacea when designing ARM cores would have left Intel in an even worse position.<p>Sorry, where does the article say Intel should design Arm cores in 2024?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

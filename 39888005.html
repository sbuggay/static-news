(Kind of like CDO.[1])<p>Anyone who makes an effort has skin in the game. Unless your PR was made by ChatGPT or you are sending out spam PRs, you have skin in the game. (Of course there’s an asymmetry here since the maintainer has to deal with this spam. But isn’t it like email? Eventually with enough spam it will be tolerated to by-default ignore solicitations based on heuristics.)<p>Someone can spend a week on a PR and get immediately rejected because the maintainer liked neither the approach nor the feature. Okay but wait, you say, why didn’t you just ask about the design before you made the PR? Because some projects will politely say “send patches” if you first do a preliminary feeler-inquiry. They won’t even tell you what the chances of such a change being accepted and will just give you a generic “we will judge it on its merit and usefulness” approach.[2]<p>&gt; In a sense this is a generic rant about missing the “good old times” (that probably never were), where people talked to each other eye to eye.<p>They’re simulating eye-to-eye&#x2F;real life interactions.

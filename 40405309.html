I am sure my fingerprints (code I wrote) still exist in past jobs... the past companies I have worked for.<p>Sadly, going back to my first job, I know the project I wrote came to an abrupt end a few years after I left. I am sure that codebase has long since disappeared... though I might still find some code in USB sticks, somewhere.<p>Even my previous job, some front end gui projects are likely terminated due to structural changes in the company. Going all-cloud with a product which would have changed bespoke applications.<p>All comes down to experience. If I could go back in time to my first job, I could &quot;hack&quot; out that code in days.. rather than months, but I am diverting the topic a little. lol.<p>&gt; These days, I take the most pleasure out of building careers and mentoring younger engineers<p>Again -- agreed!<p>Doing my bit to help find their feet is very rewarding. Being in my 40s and seeing &quot;kids&quot; that are 10, 15, or near 20 years younger than me is a reality-check for me! It comes a point when my humour in the room no longer lands... because they have no idea what I refer to. I nearly get a heart attack when I hear someone say &quot;I have not seen Robocop&quot;<p>The other reality-check, and a more serious one, is that I am at an age of guidance... for them. I remember being their age, with little help or guide from the older, senior devs in the room. I swore I would never be like this. Well, I am now at that age they once were.<p>I know at least a couple of guys I have worked with, for different reasons, have moved on and are successful. If I can claim atleast 2% of their good decisions.. I will take it. Very happy for them!<p>Getting good pay is one thing.
Mentoring new careers is heart warming.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40413025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40413025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">m463</span><span>|</span><a href="#40412597">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413439">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40412667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40413025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40413025">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most of the companies I&#x27;ve worked for no longer exist, let alone the code.<p>Even stranger, I&#x27;ve never had anything to show as the code never &quot;existed&quot; in the physical sense.</div><br/><div id="40413523" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40413523" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drmpeg</span><span>|</span><a href="#40412597">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40413025">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40412667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40413523">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40413523">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">None of the companies I&#x27;ve worked for exist today.

How does that relate to money problems and health problems?<p>Is becoming a multiplier mutually exclusive from chasing financial success in your opinion?<p>EDIT to elaborate on the concept of a multiplier. Say you can become a mythical 10x engineer or you can become a mentor. If you can mentor 5 normal engineers from 1x to 2x then you&#x27;ve now got 10x engineering and the org also has reduced bus factor.<p>What about if those 5 2x engineers can bring another 25 0.5x engineers up to 1x engineers. Suddenly your org can become much more than a single 10x engineer can accomplish.<p>This is quite spurious and 9 mothers can&#x27;t have a baby in 1 month but it&#x27;s a useful mental model for the value of individual contribution vs coaching&#x2F;managing.<p>In reality while people like to balk at the idea of the 10x engineer, the truth is there are probably 100x and 1000x engineers out there. Von Neumann is probably a 1000x or more.

Quotes from Jobs or Woz don&#x27;t show even the tiniest real glimpse into who a person is.  Stories about persons, especially those with significant media presence, are often tailored, and invariably seen through the optics of the author of the article.  Certainly, anyone who has been through an interview knows that what they say is cut, altered, quoted in partial context, etc.<p>Only people who have actually worked with Jobs and Woz know them.  And even then, they often only know them <i>at work</i>.  A brief interjection into a work day once a month isn&#x27;t &quot;knowing someone&quot; either.  Sitting in a room of 1000 people for a company wide meeting isn&#x27;t knowing them.<p>My point is, these sorts of deep thoughts aren&#x27;t something we can gauge from 2nd party discussions about someone.  You need to <i>know</i> a person, personally, to actually be able to gauge what they actually believed.<p>I&#x27;ve always been sort of... sad that so much of the world looks at people from so far away, and then takes stock in what they hear&#x2F;gleam.  Quotes from figures religious, from every religion, are a popular theme here.  &quot;Some guy said something 2000 years ago&quot;, filtered through a half dozen translations, and church dogma, are taken as if a person had known the person for 20 years.  Meanwhile, we literally haven&#x27;t a clue what was said in such cases.<p>Yet the same is true of all hearsay strewn about all such figures.  It&#x27;s just word snippets taken out of context, of a single hour in a person&#x27;s life.<p>For example, if I asked anyone here the same question 10 years apart, would the answer be the same?  Would the response even remotely resemble the prior?  If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then the topic isn&#x27;t complex, or the person hasn&#x27;t learned anything in their life.<p>So to this I would say, irregardless of how many dislike Job&#x27;s work ethics re: employee interaction, what would a 70 year old Jobs say?  And say in person, without being &quot;on&quot;?

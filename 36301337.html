You say lots of complementary things about HN and suggest that the quality is what you’re aiming for. But you also say you “don’t believe in censorship”. Depending on what you mean by censorship (people have wildly different definitions!), you’ll need to reconcile the fact that HN has relatively restrictive community guidelines, and very active moderation. Many people would credit the high quality of discussion to those things.<p>Secondly, I think your “tags as subreddits” misses the point of subreddits. They’re not a filtering mechanism for which links you want to see, they’re a way to let users associate into small(er) communities where community norms, standards, shared experiences, running jokes, moderation expectations, and generally a community identity and spirit can develop.</div><br/><div id="36303921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36303921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danudey</span><span>|</span><a href="#36302456">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304531">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36303921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36303921">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think <i>most</i> &#x27;Reddit alternative&#x27; options that people are trying to show off are missing what made Reddit great.

It might just be that smaller forums are easier to moderate, but also I think lobste.rs&#x27; moderation isn&#x27;t vulnerable to some of the exploits that HN&#x27;s moderation succumbs to. For instance, on HN if someone posts something mildly negative, they&#x27;ll likely get moderated; however, if they post something that&#x27;s pretty obviously hostile (to most people, anyway) but with the thinnest possible veneer of plausible deniability, they&#x27;re not likely to be moderated (and anyone who challenges this plausible deniability may themselves be moderated for violating the &#x27;assume positive intent&#x27; guideline). Lobste.rs&#x27; moderation lets users flag violating posts and too many flags will result in some moderation--I&#x27;m sure this could also be abused, but so far it seems to be doing a good job--maybe there&#x27;s something Zsync could learn from their approach as well?</div><br/><div id="36303057" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36303057" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aw1621107</span><span>|</span><a href="#36302456">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36302856">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36302994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36303057">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36303057">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Lobste.rs&#x27; moderation lets users flag violating posts and too many flags will result in some moderation--I&#x27;m sure this could also be abused, but so far it seems to be doing a good job<p>I believe HN moderation works similarly.

You don&#x27;t want to be one of those fascists that only allows speech you agree with, do you?<p>We all know that limiting speech is bad and that freedom of speech is an unalloyed good (I&#x27;m being very serious there, it is), but this absolute position really applies to governments restricting speech and the spread of ideas in the population. Where exactly the line is when it comes to slander&#x2F;libel&#x2F;defamation, or what constitutes incitement to violence, or a myriad of other things...  well that&#x27;s not something people can easily agree on within or across societies. But regardless, you get &#x27;points&#x27; for being in favour of freedom of speech even if you can&#x27;t fully define it. Because you&#x27;re not anti speech or anti freedom, are you?<p>When this translates to private companies and the internet, the services want to claim they&#x27;re all for free speech, but they also realise that this emboldens really unpleasant people to say really unpleasant things, which in turn drives away the mainstream audience. So they have to find ways to moderate or censor without triggering the voices that will shout about censorship. This means doing it quietly, passing the buck where possible, and generally trying not to look like you&#x27;re doing it at all.<p>To me it all stems from a couple of odd logical disconnects people have -<p>1. Private platforms and government censorship are equivalent - &quot;The government censoring stuff would be totalitarian, therefore if Twitter doesn&#x27;t give the most vile hatred exactly the same platform and prevalence as all other speech we may as well all be living in North Korea&quot;. This doesn&#x27;t follow, to me. You can still spew your bile with impunity, but there is no obligation for any one company to hand you a megaphone, you can always go buy your own.<p>2. The marketplace of ideas - Good ideas will win out over bad, the best way to tackle bad speech is with more good speech to counter it. Lovely, high-minded principle but a complete bust when many participants in the alleged marketplace aren&#x27;t in the slightest bit interested in seeking truth, exchanging ideas or finding the better ones, but rather flooding the common space with verbiage for political or monetary gain.<p>But in the face of &quot;You believe in free speech, don&#x27;t you?&quot; this sort of nuance is lost.</div><br/><div id="36305292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36305292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nl</span><span>|</span><a href="#36304038">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304489">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36304365">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36305292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36305292">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just a note that sarcasm doesn&#x27;t translate well online.

To that I mean, take a standard community.  A community that has existed for, quite literally, through our ancestors for countless generations.<p>In such a community, sure... people could say anything they wanted.  People can do so now!  That is, you go for a walk, and people can approach you, say whatever, there is a wide range of what you can say in public.<p>But... if you act too aggressively, you get a punch in the head.  If you yell and scream obscenities, people ignore you, if you do it too much, you again get a punch in the head.  If you say &#x27;crazy things&#x27; but are polite, people make excuses &quot;Sorry, have to go look at this bush over here... talk to you later, have a nice day!&quot;.  If you stand in the middle of a park and start screaming, again ... if you don&#x27;t stop ... punch to the head.<p>(In more modern times, &#x27;punch to the head&#x27; may be replaced by &#x27;officials that come and make you stop via force if necessary&#x27;, but the result is the same)<p>And to this, if you have people sitting in a park at a picnic table, enjoying a conversation, there is a limit to what people will tolerate.. if you just amble on over, start talking, and at the same time don&#x27;t &quot;fit&quot;.  If you join a church, same thing.  If you join a club, same thing.<p>Imagine if people got together, a group of 5 friends a picnic table at a park weekly, to talk about hockey, and some guy came over <i>every day</i> and started talking about how hockey is really fascist, and you&#x27;re all asshoes, and blah blah.<p>Would that go over well?  HELL NO!<p>In short, there is no moderation in traditional society, but there is also no tolerance for people shoving their face in your business.  People that do not fit are not tolerated.<p>People confuse &quot;how people interact in real life&quot; with &quot;people can say anything they want in real life&quot;.<p>Taking a step back, people have never had limitless ability to force others to hear their crap.  You could take out ads in a periodical &#x2F; newspaper... IF the newspaper thought it was not going to get many people mad at them!  You could print your own &quot;stuff&quot;, and pay to have it delivered, or hand deliver it to people on the street.  You could print stuff and try to get people to <i>buy</i> it.  There are loads of delivery methods, but even this is all <i>new</i>, 200 years ago no average person could do this.<p>So some online forum where you&#x27;re talking about turtle eggs, and endless people liken it to &quot;MY GUY!&quot; or &quot;POLITICAL THING&quot; or &quot;BUY MY APPLES&quot; is absolutely non-real in terms of how humans have ever acted before!<p>Something like &#x2F;., with its moderation system, and its meta-moderation system was a good start.  &quot;No!  Go away from my picnic table!&quot; with the comment still there but gone, is much like real life.  But even that is not completely real, for eventually people &quot;punch you in the head&quot; if you persist.<p>As this thread discusses, most moderation systems seem unable to handle this.  The truly sad thing is, I think that:<p>* until sock puppeting is impossible<p>* until identity is linked to your actions immutably<p>We won&#x27;t ever get past this.<p>And this means that anonymity needs to end, and a person&#x27;s actions need to count, because in the real world everyone can see &quot;Oh crap, Bob&#x27;s coming over here again&quot;, and &quot;eventually you go to jail&quot; is how we deal with human interaction in <i>real life</i>.<p>NOTE: none of this detracts from people <i>wanting to</i>, in real life, have a club of &quot;completely open ideas&quot;.

Having a high bar for censorship is what places like HN are founded on. Setting guidelines is a good course of action for that. This is opposed to a code of conduct, which is essentially a pseudo-legal system that assuages some idea of fairness, which you&#x27;ll frankly never have in social.<p>- Given the name ZSync it seems like you want to attract techies. I don&#x27;t think ML or any algorithm which cannot be sufficiently explained is going to work well.<p>- Tags are not a substitute for subreddits; there&#x27;s hard separation in a subreddit whereas tags are pretty fluid and usually a filterable option.<p>- There are so many zsyncs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=zsync" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=zsync</a> and I don&#x27;t even get what it&#x27;s syncing.<p>&gt; HN still has the highest discussion quality of any &quot;forum&quot; I know of, but (1) it can sometimes randomly be very hostile&#x2F;toxic to new tech, the most glaring example being crypto.<p>HN was pretty amenable to crypto when it came about. Over time things soured. I think when things crossed the line here is probably when people started openly advocating removing code hosting for even basic non-grift crypto tech and then were seen advocating for AI ~1.5 months later. I don&#x27;t think you can pick and choose what future weird attitudes your users will adopt.<p>&gt; HN is basically a single subreddit mostly geared towards tech and startups. It&#x27;d be nice to have an equivalent of &quot;subreddits&quot;.<p>HN is geared towards curiosity technically. The community may select for more than that via the flag and voting system; the selection bias will also change as HN gains more users of more diverse backgrounds and as people age into new careers&#x2F;life.

Tags are not the equivalent of subreddits. They throw away the good parts of subreddits. You can&#x27;t foster a community around a niche with tags. Submitting the same content to multiple subreddits is an optimization not really even related to the problem of high quality content.<p>2. Incentivizing&#x2F;rewarding high quality content isn&#x27;t enough to prevent low quality content. Without moderation, you&#x27;ll have enough terrible content get through that those incentives don&#x27;t outweigh the poor experience.<p>3. Crypto tips are not a strong incentive to create high quality content. I would never even consider participating in this for that reason alone. It is one thing to not want crypto-bashing, it is another to assume that people <i>want</i> crypto tips instead of upvotes and downvotes.<p>4. The machine learning idea also goes against what made subreddits so useful: what is great about Reddit is that it doesn&#x27;t just feed you random posts you might like, instead it fosters small communities. People create meaningful content for their communities. Content curated by ML is not as meaningful.<p>5. All those things above that I mentioned in theory, show up in practice when I go to your site. The front page is already a low quality spam dump.<p>If you want to come up with a solution to your goal I would focus on aspects of other platforms that work well, and innovate&#x2F;improve on them, rather than throwing the good parts away entirely and hoping it will be better just because it&#x27;s different. Learn what makes Reddit great and what makes it not so great. The people who are participating in the current reddit blackout are protesting being locked out of using third party apps that enhance the user experience. They are not protesting the design of how subreddits work, lack of crypto tips with upvotes, or the fact that subreddits are moderated.

The concept of subreddits may seem restrictive, but it&#x27;s also good at filtering low-effort content when you want a more curated experience. If you allow anyone to tag any post with any tag, it could become chaotic.<p>2. I think the only way to incentivize high quality content is by only having users that value high quality content. You can&#x27;t take a random sample from the general population, give them a button that says &quot;this is high quality content&quot; and expect them to actually select high quality content. You need a way to filter users, and it doesn&#x27;t need to be an explicit filter, you just need to find ways to discourage the people you don&#x27;t want using it from using it (e.g. by not having any images&#x2F;video, like HN).<p>3.

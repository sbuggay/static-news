We thought the same initially, it turns out the system depends on many more components than you would think.<p>I imagined the EV system to be like an onion where you can take layers off, not so!It is much more like an egg, once you smash it, you have a few shards that you can re-use but you end up with a mess due to high connectivity between systems.

Or you isolate the inverter and motor and make them believe they are still in the original vehicle by replaying CAN messages, ZombieVerter is a project with that approach.

The same can be said about all kinds of things from food to pig iron. We&#x27;re not talking about tech in any sense. The US mastered every single industry it sent to China with great efficiency, but the exchange rate situation and low wages there make it very difficult for a US company to compete.<p>Also, China protects its markets much better than we do. In order to sell in China you have to set up a 51% Chinese-owned outfit just to do that. Meanwhile they dump all their products on the world market with very few reciprocal relationships. Imagine how different things would be if we required Chinese companies to do the 51% US-owned franchise thing here. We could even require them to build factories here. Of course, there is no point doing that. If they did it, the goods would be just as expensive as 100% American companies. That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t bother. They on the other hand do it mainly to swipe whatever knowledge they can from foreign companies. I&#x27;ve seen many accounts of this from US companies.

But I will try to spell it out even more.<p>Labor is almost certainly not as cheap in Mexico as it is in China. China still enjoys benefits of &quot;developing nation&quot; status despite being very advanced when it comes to manufacturing. There are many variables when it comes to productivity such as the amount of investment, the size of the workforce, and government subsidies. If you believe in specialization, then having a much larger population to work (as also consume the product) is a big advantage. The Chinese government is heavily involved with its domestic businesses, from literally owning them to spying on their behalf, to putting up roadblocks for any competition. Mexico might be as advanced as China if we had outsourced everything to them instead of China, but I&#x27;m sure that did not make sense when we started doing it and it probably still does not.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magic about China. It&#x27;s just got lots of people and cheap labor, and a bunch of policies that are unfair to the rest of the world. They have a head start of about 30+ years on Mexico and other competition. The US and euro nations have let everything basically rot for 30+ years instead as everything got shipped to China. It&#x27;s not that we can&#x27;t do anything that they can do in principle, but it takes time and investment and the result is hard-pressed to make enough money due to the fact China can do it cheaper. In most cases Western manufacturing was better than Chinese for the longest time, but we basically taught them all our trade secrets without them sharing back any knowledge. We don&#x27;t have a large pool of workers with manufacturing experience as they do, because of the outsourcing.<p>We have some subsidies, but they pale in comparison to what China does and come with random obligations like quotas per ethnicity or sexual orientation. TSMC complained about this stuff recently. They got billions of dollars in subsidies but still struggle to hire the right people locally in the US.<p>It takes decades for some of these industries to build up, even going back to the university training pipeline. The idea of pushing a &quot;service economy&quot; is a costly mistake that nearly all Western countries fell into. At some point, China and other manufacturing-based nations will refuse to take worthless Western currencies in exchange for their goods. That is, unless we have something real to offer in exchange.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42031100" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42031100" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Qwertious</span><span>|</span><a href="#42028443">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42029427">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030672">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42029516">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42031100">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42031100">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Their prices are lower because China went all-in on EVs in 2010 (as a country, not just their car companies), whereas US companies are <i>still</i> flirting with ICE and hybrids <i>in 2024</i>, and woe betide any US politician who advocates making it harder to register an ICE vehicle.<p>Labor prices matter, but 14 years of dithering matters more.</div><br/><div id="42031634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42031634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Animats</span><span>|</span><a href="#42028443">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42031418">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42031634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42031634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; woe betide any US politician who advocates making it harder to register an ICE vehicle.<p>Right.

First, the time period is more like 30 years for cars having engine control units (ecu), but most car up until 10 years ago or so had hard physically wired throttles where you stepping on the throttle pulled a physical cable. If that cable doesn’t get pulled the engine doesn’t get enough air to go really fast no matter what the ecu tries to do. More recent cars have fly by wire throttles meaning they are like electric cars in that sense.<p>An ecu has a far more complicated control algorithm than a electric motor controller. If it were suddenly damaged it’s more like that the engine would fail to run at all then run out of control because the ecu needs to control the airflow, fuel and spark position for the engine to run, if any of those fail to work, or stop firing at the right the exact time they are required the engine will just stop or run very poorly. I actually think this is true of electric vehicles too, it’s far more likely to stop the motor working than to have it run out of control, unless a wheel speed sensor is damaged or something.<p>A petrol car can be placed into neutral if all else fails, the engine will run out of control but the car wont. Also the gearbox controller is typically a different computer from the ecu.<p>The brakes on any car should be able to over power the engine. This is not a challenge for 99% of petrol cars because the torque they output is tiny compared to what a brake system can apply to the wheels. If you slam on the brakes the engine doesn’t even come close. Idk about other countries but in Australia this also applies to electric cars that are road legal, it’s a requirement.<p>the ecu is usually located in the passenger cabin or sometimes next to the battery quite deep inside the engine bay.<p>The only thing that would cause a petrol engine to really go out of control would be if it was fly by wire throttle and that throttle position sensor was broken in the particular way that it’s reading as full throttle. Idk if manufacturers do this but it wouldn’t be hard to design a fly by wire throttle that when it fails the ecu will see it as closed not open.<p>Anyway I don’t think it’s much of a concern for electric cars either tbh.</div><br/><div id="42031496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42031496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grecy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42028562">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030677">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42030796">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42031496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42031496">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once had a diesel engine runaway (google it, the engine ran on its own oil at some insane rpm).

The air conditioning, power steering, and many other components are run off of these belts. An EV motor doesn&#x27;t spin while idling. These components will need another power source, or they&#x27;ll have to be replaced with EV-specific components.<p>- Combustion vehicles use waste heat from the engine to heat the cabin. Unless you live in a mild climate, a retrofit will need electric heating coils (or a heat pump for maximum efficiency).<p>And after making all of these modifications, you&#x27;ll need to deal with regulations around making sure the vehicle is street legal. Those can differ greatly based on the state and the model year of the vehicle you&#x27;re converting.

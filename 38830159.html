Have <i>it</i> read and triage my inbox, and if it&#x27;s important and urgent, call me. Otherwise just summarize it in an EOD back and forth.<p>Rather than seeing AI as enslaving me to overstimulation for my monkey brain I see it as a potential liberator at long last.<p>Similarly, while yes Moore&#x27;s Law for most traditional computing workloads means we&#x27;re hitting a flattening curve, specifically neural network workloads have continued massive potential in hardware shifts over the next decade. And the ways in which we are already seeing proof of concepts for moving traditional computing tasks to AI has me wondering just how important traditional processing is actually going to be for the majority of my increasingly liberated computer usage.<p>For the first time in over a decade I&#x27;m actually looking forward to what tech has to bring to my life beyond a slightly faster processor with diminishing returns.</div><br/><div id="38839362" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839362" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justanotherjoe</span><span>|</span><a href="#38839169">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38839177">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839362">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839362">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I see this sentiment a lot.

It really shed light on the &#x27;always online&#x27; thing: we never really &#x27;want&#x27; this, rather we feel that it is necessary for survival.  
Given the same benefit, people would rather not be on the internet.

It is an amazing capability to be able to run Stable Diffusion and LLMs like Mistral in the privacy and control of your own hardware.<p>Despite whatever assurances OpenAI may give you about the privacy of your data, you are not in control. They already deem certain prompts problematic. How long before they forward problematic prompts to law enforcement? Also, how safe is your IP? We already know that LLMs can reproduce some of their training material verbatim. Do you want your source code to be able to be reproduced like that?<p>The latest consumer hardware is able to run a lot of these models at acceptable performance.

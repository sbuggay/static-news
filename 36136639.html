I&#x27;ve lived in Canada, the UK and the US. My experiences with the police in the UK were really very good. They are polite, affable, efficient and seem to care about their work. Canadian police are not quite as good, IMO, but still reasonably ok, although they do tend to have the &quot;command attitude&quot; and slight military edge that I associate with the US police. I did not have any contact with police in the six years I was in the US.</div><br/><div id="36147884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36147884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brutusborn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36147545">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36148550">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36147884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36147884">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d say the same for Australian as you do for Canadian police: mostly good but with a &#x27;command attitude.&#x27; The general feeling here is that police spend too much time &#x27;revenue raising&#x27; rather than policing crime the community actually cares about, like theft and violence. I think this would be solved with a dedicated force for less serious offenses and fines. I think the best system is the UK where most police have no weapons and little power, but can call for an armed response if necessary.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36148550" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36148550" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mihaic</span><span>|</span><a href="#36147545">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147985">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36148550">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36148550">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">After reading this list of basic yet primary principles on how to police, my first though is what changes would make sense in the age of technology -- almost none IMO.<p>Yet after that I&#x27;m thinking of how many layers of second or third order arguments I see from the US to deal with lawlessness is San Francisco for instance, and how that&#x27;s altered even my views as far-removed Eastern European.<p>There don&#x27;t seem to be obvious actions, but the US really needs to cut down on its layers of abstraction, since it&#x27;s leaking then all over the world.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36147985" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36147985" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rektide</span><span>|</span><a href="#36148550">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36147237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36147985">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36147985">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;d just caution that Bill Parker, police chief in 1950 Los Angeles, was also thinking he had consent of &quot;civilization&quot; in suppressing the &quot;disorderly chaos&quot;, but which often really meant anyone not fitting certain stereotypes. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thin_blue_line" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thin_blue_line</a><p>This lead to extreme racial injustice&#x2F;discrimination, which lead to the 1965 Watts riots.

The classic legal view of police power is that the only extra authority police have is the authority to arrest on suspicion. Anyone has the authority to arrest if they witness a felony. This worked in the UK until the second half of the 19th century, before handguns were common. A group of citizens could detain a crook. See &quot;Hue and cry&quot;.<p>(Handguns didn&#x27;t work very well until the second half of the 19th century, with
the development of all-metal cartridges and revolvers. Handguns before that were single shot,
high-maintenance, rather fussy to use, and often misfired.

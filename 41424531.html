The value of a single family home in California has increased 10%-11% year over year. Is your salary increasing 10-11% year over year? What’s the point of chasing income at your job once you own a single family home here? Lol. I had to explain to my wife today that it’s ok that she hasn’t replaced her 70k a year salary and that it’s ok for her to be in school right now. We could sell our house and pocket the difference and nothing was lost financially.<p>Hopefully the companies doing business here catch up, I know it’s going to take a lot of difficult conversations and hand wringing, I’m really rooting for them.

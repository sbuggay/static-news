The pricing structure is based on making moms feel like they got a good deal on a &quot;sale&quot;, but actually everything is just overpriced and you can&#x27;t get things with the appropriate price unless you play their dumb game.  There are stories about department stores stopping this and losing lots of sales because their customers were addicted to it.<p>They simply failed to change to attract new generations, their buyers couldn&#x27;t buy for the next generation, so they kept targeting their aging customer base until they were gone and poof, no more department stores.<p>You probably could do a new generation of department store targeting younger folks, but it would have to be much different.  Probably won&#x27;t happen.<p>My last department store trip was to buy socks, they didn&#x27;t have what I wanted, then I paid an outrageous price for average athletic socks because I didn&#x27;t have the right coupon, store card, flier, whatever.  I wanted socks more than I wanted to go through the trouble of buying nicer or cheaper ones on the Internet as I was already there.<p>Kohls has a deal where they will give you a substantial coupon if you return something from Amazon to the store.

And the sales pitch is one of high value, you might even say beauty or care.</i><p>Yes, exactly.  To add to that, the salespeople in each department got a percentage sales commission.  E.g. at Sears department store, the salesperson in jewelry dept was on a commission structure.  The salesman working the Sears appliance center got a commission when the customer bought a washer &amp; dryer or refrigerator; same situation in the Sears furniture department when a customer bought a sofa.<p>In contrast, the big-box discount stores like Walmart and HomeDepot have hourly paid employees without sales commissions.</div><br/><div id="41640839" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41640839" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vector_spaces</span><span>|</span><a href="#41640226">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640568">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41640839">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41640839">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I realize you aren&#x27;t saying this, but note that while commissions are common among larger department stores, it doesn&#x27;t hold true in general across specialist retailers that every staff member is on commission. For instance, if you go to a specialty cheese or wine shop, or a fishmonger or supplement store or even smaller local department stores, it&#x27;s entirely possible to meet a sales clerk on commission, but it&#x27;s also (perhaps more) likely that you won&#x27;t.<p>Also, RE staff commissions -- this isn&#x27;t always bad for the customer as some here are implying. Although there are stores where commissions can come directly from the manufacturer, or where some manufacturers offer staff commissions but some don&#x27;t -- this tends to be bad, nearly always.<p>On the other hand, if the commission comes from the employer, this can incentivize staff to build deeper product knowledge and awareness of tradeoffs between different brands and products (not to mention: mindfulness of trends, customer feedback and return rates, etc), which IME leads to better service and better sales for everyone involved. I mean, yes, sure, it can also lead to employees simply parroting whatever they learned from the manufacturer brochure. YMMV<p>Brick &amp; mortar retailers that don&#x27;t provide commissions at all often still allow manufacturer led trainings of staff -- the retailer views this as essentially free staff development and morale building by increasing staff product knowledge while often providing free product or steep discounts. Sometimes manufacturers will straight up give away prizes unrelated to the products they sell (I&#x27;ve seen supplement vendors give away iPhones or cash prizes, for instance). Sales reps sometimes build personal relationships with certain retail workers they know have influence over purchasing or merchandising decisions. Often this is explicitly forbidden, but in practice virtually every company that has rules like this also rarely enforces them<p>In any case, my point is that commission structures do not imply that you&#x27;re getting bad&#x2F;misleading information from sales staff, and lack of commission structures don&#x27;t mean that sales staff are free of undue influence from sales reps and manufacturers or that they otherwise aren&#x27;t incentivized somehow to push a particular product on you.</div><br/><div id="41641414" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41641414" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RGamma</span><span>|</span><a href="#41640226">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640839">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41640626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41641414">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41641414">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s probably a good idea if you can find a self-employed expert for that specialty (like a decorator or kitchen builder) and have them make recommendations on what to get where.

He&#x27;s the middleman between the manufacturers and the stores. He has a territory and based on what&#x27;s happening in other stores in the region he can steer them toward the right stuff for <i>their</i> store. I.e., what&#x27;s this store&#x27;s target age range, how affluent is the area, and so on. In return, when he does a good job with them, they will learn to trust his advice on what will generally sell well, and he ends up getting better commissions. He sells about a dozen lines from about six manufacturers, though about three or four of the lines tend to make up the bulk of his income.<p>Since he&#x27;s very good at his job, he can demand higher commissions than other salesmen just to take a line on.

I never buy anything outside of maybe a snack from their over-the-top food halls (most recently Moomin-shaped-gummies in Helsinki), or a sometimes surprisingly affordable lunch at one of their lunch counters (it&#x27;s hard to beat the view you get along with your lunch or apéro at the top Galeries Lafayette on their terrace).<p>But in any case, none of these flagships have ever seemed empty or disused.  On the contrary, I&#x27;m always surprised that while I might be astounded by the prices on display, there are always hundreds of local shoppers who seem to be quite happy to pay them.</div><br/><div id="41644277" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41644277" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#41640477">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41644074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41644277">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41644277">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In the Netherlands, most of the traditional department stores have imploded and are long gone. I live in Germany currently and the local chains here have been struggling for decades as well.<p>The exception to this seems to be flagship luxury stores with exclusive and expensive stuff on display. Here in Berlin that would be the Alexanderplatz Galeria and the KaDeWe on Kudamm. Both attract a lot of tourism. But the chains that own them are struggling as well. Tourists of course look but there&#x27;s only so much they are going to stuff in their hand luggage when they fly back home. And they don&#x27;t come back that often. The issue is that the locals ignore these stores because they can get better deals online for essentially anything sold inside those stores.<p>KaDeWe filed for bankruptcy and is being restructured. And the group that owns Galeria is also being restructured. And not for the first time. Most of these things have been handed off between various hedge funds for decades now and they are just milking these things for short term profit.<p>Online shopping killed off that market.

Fiskars had frying pans, scissors, and everything they make, up to and almost including  their wood splitting axes. Other brands had their frying pans, pots, cutting boards, aprons, salt shakers, and whatever. I felt that I was supposed to decide first on what brand I wanted, and then what kind of thing. Maybe some people shop that way, but for me it certainly didn&#x27;t work. Same thing with Magasin du Nord in Copenhagen. All about brands. A little bit of friendly service, but nothing special. But yes, they are busy with tourists and even some locals shopping. Glad we still have a few shops that specialize in the kind of things they sell, and can provide good service.

Linguists describe it as &quot;Early Modern English&quot;. It&#x27;s contemporaneous with the King James Bible, which is still widely read, without translation.<p>The difficulty with Shakespeare isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s in Elizabethan English, but that it&#x27;s in poetry. The Russians and French have strong poetic cultures. They enjoy reading poetry, and the challenge of writing it, including translation. That just doesn&#x27;t exist in Anglophone cultures.<p>But Shakespeare wasn&#x27;t meant to be read. It was meant to be performed, and a native speaker watching a good performance has no need of translation. The emotions and flow of the story are clear. They may not understand each and every word, but that&#x27;s often true of even the latest movies. (The dialogue is often mixed in a way that makes it hard to understand -- by the director&#x27;s choice.)<p>I regularly perform Shakespeare for audiences who have never seen it before, and I never translate a word of it. I generally edit it to make it move more briskly than Elizabethan audiences wanted, but the only time I&#x27;ll change a word is to make the pronouns match the actors I cast (and not even always then).<p>Shakespeare&#x27;s stories are rarely worth preserving for their own sake. The stories themselves are dated -- not the words, but the culture. There&#x27;s no &quot;translation&quot; that will make Claudio not an asshole for the way he treats Hero, or make Hero not look pitiful for taking him back.<p>Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in modern words are always flat, dull, and penitential. If you&#x27;re going to modernize the language, modernize the whole thing -- go see the delightful &quot;Ten Things I Hate About You&quot; or the magical &quot;West Side Story&quot;.</div><br/><div id="40981935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">materielle</span><span>|</span><a href="#40978283">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40978852">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981935">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1) Shakespeare didn’t use literary language.

It&#x27;s not because the words are unfamiliar, but because Shakespeare has a fondness for long, elliptical sentences and convoluted grammar. It can be hard to figure out where the emphasis goes.<p>It helps that the poetry gives you a lot of cues. Iambic pentameter gives you a framework. Deviations from it are cues that something is important. It&#x27;s not a formula for performance, but it reveals just how much more Shakespeare was directing you than just the words to say.<p>John Barton&#x27;s &quot;Playing Shakespeare&quot; course has been how they teach that to RSC actors, and that has given us some of the greatest Shakespeare lights of the last 50 years. The videos of it with his students are magnificent views of a comically young Patrick Stewart, a ridiculously baby-faced Judi Dench, a positively embryonic Ian McKellen, and many others.<p>Inexperienced readers may not be able to get that just from reading it aloud by themselves.

To me it feels like foreign language learning on easy mode.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not good at foreign languages.  I&#x27;ve never become fluent in one.  But I studied Latin back in high school, and Japanese more recently, enough to slowly read some works written in those languages.  When doing so, there&#x27;s a real thrill in seeing a familiar idea expressed in a way that&#x27;s grammatically totally alien.  Using sentence structures that aren&#x27;t allowed in English.  Using a vocabulary that marks out a different lattice in the space of possible meanings, connecting some ideas that are disconnected in English, or splitting apart ideas that English connects.  Or just using idioms or cultural references that don&#x27;t exist in English.  Meanwhile, in the case of Latin, the vocabulary is full of words that are the ancestors of English words, with meanings that are sometimes the same, sometimes subtly different, and sometimes seemingly totally unrelated, making it feel mind-expanding just to consider the series of semantic shifts that let one meaning evolve into the other.<p>Reading Shakespeare is like that, just… less so.  Grammar, vocabulary, and idioms are all familiar enough that you can understand their meaning with just some helpful glosses, yet foreign enough to reproduce some of the same thrill.  Sometimes they&#x27;re more thrilling <i>because</i> they&#x27;re familiar – because they could be plopped right into modern English and fit into the existing scaffolding, filling in what can now be recognized as a gap.<p>So in a way I agree with John McWhorter.  When I read Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the foreignness of the language does distract me from the content.  But it&#x27;s in a good way, a fun way.  To have an experience that&#x27;s more about the content, in contrast, I can watch performances of the plays.  When performed, the dialogue usually goes by too fast for me to understand the unfamiliar bits, but the way the actors speak it helps get the meaning across.  There does still tend to be a risk that I miss out on part of the meaning and get confused about a plot point… but it&#x27;s not the end of the world.<p>Still, I&#x27;m sympathetic to people who find it hard to get into Shakespeare because of this.  Not everyone has to share my interest in language.  Some may find it difficult; some may just dislike the tradeoff of language distracting from content.  If translation helps those people, I&#x27;m in favor of that being an option.  But reading poems in translation has its own massive cost.  A translation of Beowulf <i>isn&#x27;t</i> Beowulf; it&#x27;s something related but new and different.  Same goes for the Divine Comedy, the Odyssey, the Bible, et cetera.

Arguably, the Internet is having an even stronger influence, turning English into a global lingua franca the likes of which the world has not seen since the Roman Empire, or possibly even before that. Also, more and more people are educated throughout the world, and English is taught in a fairly consistent manner everywhere.<p>Writing, consistent and universal education, and global dominance are all factors that work against the development of a language. Yes, new words and slang terms are being adopted constantly, and perhaps just as many are falling out of use, but overall the meaning of a sentence spoken today would be easy enough for a speaker from the 1800s to understand, and there’s no reason to believe it will be any different for a speaker from the 2300s.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40981962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40981962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Affric</span><span>|</span><a href="#40978283">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40979079">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40981440">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40979109">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40981962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40981962">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Point of information: we don’t have a Shakespeare manuscript.

When you arrive at a word like mutiny think that Shakespeare isn’t talking about a literal mutiny (though he might be) but something that is like a mutiny. What are mutinies like, not in cause but in deed. When Shakespeare starts talking about “atomies” he has no knowledge or Bohr or QM, but we know that atoms are really small. When Mercutio mentions Crickets bone… well, Crickets don’t have bones but if they did they would be small.<p>Shakespeare’s scribes weren’t writing an API for you to extract the plot out of.

In order to have have a context at all, one must have some critical mass of understanding.  The density of parts I can understand is never enough to achieve that.
My experience is that any portion of Shakespeare that I attempt to read goes the same way.  
If I dig farther into &quot;mutiny&quot;, there&#x27;s no way to know if I&#x27;m eventually going to produce a &quot;context&quot; or whether I&#x27;m on a fool&#x27;s errand.
In order to develop a context, one must somehow achieve a sufficient foothold of comprehension from which to build it.
There are precious few sentences in Shakespeare for which I would be able to do that.  The farther you get into the play, the more references there are to earlier, so you kind of have to start at the beginning.  But I can&#x27;t understand that part either.<p>You keep saying it&#x27;s easy.  I believe you when you say that&#x27;s your experience.  What I&#x27;m trying to tell you is that it&#x27;s not easy for everyone.  There is no amount of patience that I could apply to this pursuit that would yield success.

IMO, you need to develop patience with not understanding, and continuing anyway. Just read the play, see what you pick up, then read it again. Treat it like poetry and don&#x27;t worry too much about understanding every word; see if you can get the feel.

It seems like the goal of someone approaching early modern English -- the earliest iteration that&#x27;s roughly intelligible to us today  -- <i>should</i> be to learn how to read it comfortably, and that with effort, that it <i>should</i> be feasible. Like, that&#x27;s one major point of reading Shakespeare in school: so that you can get used to the feel of the language (and become a well-cultured, lifelong, paying audience member). On the other hand, there&#x27;s so much &quot;should&quot; already around reading at all, much less reading difficult old texts, that I suppose that helper notes are a public service -- and even after reading &amp; seeing lots of Shakespeare, I still need notes for some of the obscure idioms and references. And I suppose there&#x27;s no real reason why someone has to start with Shakespeare, particularly if you&#x27;re coming to this era in midlife after dozing off in English class.<p>It&#x27;s a weird thing about the canon that we pick out one or two authors from every period, and completely forget about all the others. Like, what&#x27;s the chance that the bottom 10th percentile of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are better than the top 10th of Marlowe, or of this guy Chapman who I&#x27;d never heard of? And it makes you wonder, who are the artists today who will be idolized through the ages, and who will be totally forgotten?<p>Like, it&#x27;s cool to study the compleat works of an exemplary figure like Shakespeare, but maybe if we learn to study his contemporaries and cultural context, we&#x27;ll gain a better understanding of the life and times, and be less prone to wild theories about how he couldn&#x27;t have possibly written the plays, how it must have been some other figure with a fancier education, or even a group effort.

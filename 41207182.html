There are many different things than can increase a BP measurement above the &quot;baseline&quot; including talking, moving around, not having rested but also just waking up, not being in a supported position, only a single value, etc. Most of the major health agencies (AMA,AHA,CDC, etc in the US) have recommendations on how to do it properly, but in medical situations like doctors offices and hospitals, these are rarely done as they take too much time. A single measurement is not sufficient and can result in misdiagnosis.<p>A more reliable way to measure a continuum would make a difference, but I imagine it would still require time to collect as BP is a dynamic value that changes with behavior, posture and activity.</div><br/><div id="41211309" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41211309" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hereme888</span><span>|</span><a href="#41209179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41210592">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41211309">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41211309">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m a resident physician and I deny having my BP taken in outpatient clinics.<p>The techniques used are ridiculously inappropriate:<p>&quot;Ok, Mr. So-and-so, come with me.&quot; calls the nurse, as the pt who is irritated for having to wait 30 minutes quickly gets up to walk along unknown hallways, while rushing to finish a phone conversation, stressed and not knowing where to turn next...&quot;Ok, now we&#x27;re going to weigh you on this scale&quot; while the pt thinks &#x27;oh man, I&#x27;ve probably gained weight&#x27;, followed by &quot;ok, now we&#x27;re going to measure your blood pressure.&quot; &#x27;I don&#x27;t want BP meds...let me try to relax...breathe slooowly...but I don&#x27;t want the nurse to notice I may be trying to cheat this sudden examination.&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s why the most appropriate way nowadays is to measure it at home, and keep a BP log.</div><br/><div id="41212087" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41212087" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">slaymaker1907</span><span>|</span><a href="#41209179">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41211309">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41213507">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41212087">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41212087">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One thing that I think would dramatically improve the routine screening numbers at doctors&#x27; offices would be to try and take it after the patient has been sitting down for a few minutes waiting for the doctor after the other vitals have been taken.

I also just set a timer when walking and told the nurse &quot;no not yet&quot; when they tried to take my BP. They listened except the one nurse who insisted I was wrong and that I was 5&#x27;11&quot; not 6&#x27;2&quot; which was entered in by the urgent care the day before because people get shorter as they get older. You know, a day later, at 40, after being 6&#x27;2&quot; since I was 18. no possible way she could be wrong, everyone else was. Also tried to mark me as an active smoker because I&#x27;d been in a resturant with smoking before, in the 90s and she had magically never been around smoke in her 50 years. The doctor corrected the smoker note but the height hung around in some SOT field even though the next 15 height measurements were 6&#x27;2&quot; until I had an extra 10 minutes with a PA who went over all my records with me and corrected things.<p>I had trouble with 2 of the BPs drugs, one gave me head spins in the afternoon seated in my car sometimes, another gave me the dry cough (could feel a prickle in my thorat). My bp is actually high esp when I&#x27;ve had caffiene (what coder doesnt), move around, etc, but it&#x27;s usually low pre-hyper tension. I also had it taken about 300 times in the last 6 months getting certified as an EMT. There&#x27;s a LOT of variation in how the tools take the BP and just how close you&#x27;re listening. I compared a manual cuff with one of the fancy automated ones and it&#x27;s not that hard to hear your dystolic down 10 below what the automated reads. Same with systolic, you can hear it higher if you really listen before it starts sounding like a watch with another 10 spread, and you leave that cuff at 200 for 10 seconds and everyone&#x27;s going to read higher and tense up more. I can feel my blood pressure surge any time an automated machine decides &quot;nope I need to go higher on systolic&quot; and it squeezes and I know I&#x27;m going to read high and have yet another conversation with the nurse and doctor. Just take it to 200 and come down stupid machine.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41209392" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41209392" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nulbyte</span><span>|</span><a href="#41209179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41210592">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41210616">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41209392">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41209392">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As an adult with a congenital heart defect and white coat hypertension, I can relate.

Bill Softky describes a startup he&#x27;d worked for using a similar sound-transduction continuous non-invasive blood-pressure monitoring technique.  It ... had problems:<p><i>Our non-invasive device was supposed to measure blood pressure just as accurately [as an arterial line], but without the cutting, using specially-sculpted sonic vibrations and fancy algorithmic analysis, which was my job. The overall challenge was like measuring the pressure inside a bottle without opening it.  Our device worked fine, in that our algorithmically-estimated blood pressure moved up and down, beat to beat, in lockstep with the actual blood pressure. The problem was that our estimate also moved up and down at other times as well, say when the patient moved her fingers, rotated her arm, or took vaso-constricting drugs like nicotine.  I spent most of a year understanding these problems, and understanding they couldn’t be solved before our funding ran out. That was when an old-timer taught me an important lesson of measurement: it’s fairly easy to calculate a signal which correlates with what you want to measure, the way our vibration-estimate correlated with actual blood pressure. It’s much harder, though, to calculate a signal which does NOT correlate with what you DON’T want to measure, like arm motion.</i><p>&lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;monster-monetization-bill-softky" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;monster-monetization-bill-sof...</a>&gt;<p>I&#x27;d be <i>exceedingly</i> curious as to how the CalTech team have solved that non-correlation problem.</div><br/><div id="41209472" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41209472" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mhb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41207574">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41209022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41209472">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41209472">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;pnasnexus&#x2F;article&#x2F;3&#x2F;7&#x2F;pgae252&#x2F;7717708?login=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;pnasnexus&#x2F;article&#x2F;3&#x2F;7&#x2F;pgae252&#x2F;77177...</a><p>They tested on the carotid artery.

For the last 100 days or so I have been running a personal health experiment and collecting multiple data points during the process.  I guess some use the term &quot;bio-hacking&quot;, not sure if it applies.<p>The experiment has included multiple fasting periods, with a maximum of 7 days as well as changing one variable at a time in categories such as diet and exercise.  The results have been very interesting and I intend to continue on this path until at least the end of the year.<p>As part of the data collection I have been taking my blood pressure a minimum of twice a day, sometimes more.  Also blood glucose, ketones and (consumer) EKG.<p>The first thing that jumped at me was the inaccuracy or variability of these measurements.  I even got a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor.  Interesting but useless for my purposes. The thing produced 20% error with respect to finger poke measurements.  And, then again, when I got a calibration kit to check my finger poke meter, the calibration range is approximately +&#x2F;- 18%.  In other words, unless you hit extremes it feels like these measurements are almost useless.  You can kind of tell you are going up or down, yet don&#x27;t really know where you are.<p>The same, of course, has been true of blood pressure measurements.  I went through three consumer machines.  I can&#x27;t say any of it is accurate because there are too many variables.  I have run multiple experiments with regards to where and how to measure BP.  All I can determine are relative changes by effectively measuring under as close to the same conditions as possible twice a day, morning and evening (both before meals).<p>During the last month or so I have been using a protocol I learned from one of Andrew Huberman&#x27;s presentations (can&#x27;t remember which one or I would post a link).  I believe he was interviewing a researcher who explained the process they use during their studies.  In simple terms, they take three measurements and then average.  The first is after 15 minutes sitting, feet on the ground, back supported, no movement, no speaking, no activity. The second and third are at 5 minute intervals under the same conditions.  In other words, the entire process takes at least 25 minutes.<p>After adopting this approach I have been seeing wildly different numbers with respect to the single measurement protocol I had been using for two months.  In addition to that, the standard deviation of the computed values are much tighter now.<p>This experience, so far, has made me wonder about just how many people might be misdiagnosed and put on medication every year because of bad data.  I can see the value in having more data, of course.  Yet, continuous data is only good if it is accurate to within a reasonable margin.</div><br/><div id="41213939" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41213939" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lostlogin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41210399">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41210026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41213939">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41213939">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; how many people might be misdiagnosed and put on medication every year because of bad data<p>Another variable that causes this is the patient.

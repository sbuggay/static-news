Kiwi.com does this now.<p>We worked on it from about 2008 till 2013 then basically gave up, as it was too hard to offer a service that customers could really love and trust. (It wasn&#x27;t for nought; the technology we developed was valuable, and the company was able to rebrand and pivot and now does important work for airlines to optimise loads and fares [2], though I left when the rebrand&#x2F;pivot happened).<p>The thing that makes it hard to do is it&#x27;s basically impossible to get all the flight inventory, including fares and seat availability, that&#x27;s complete and up-to-date enough to deliver a service that customers can trust.<p>The engineering challenge is one thing - solving a multi-dimensional travelling salesman problem (price and distance&#x2F;duration) highly repetitively - but you can solve that with enough smart engineers and &quot;compute&quot;, which ITA did in the early 2000s, and on a smaller scale, our team did a decade later.<p>But you could build the most beautiful routing engine the universe has ever seen, and still have a user experience that&#x27;s kind-of garbage because the industry just keeps the flight inventory data so locked down.<p>These days there are APIs and feeds available from the major distribution platforms - Sabre, Amadeus and Travelport, but it&#x27;s still not comprehensive. You often still need to negotiate individual agreements with major airlines in order to be able to publish and sell their fares. And even then, many of the low-cost airlines (which are often most of interest to travellers who want to find the cheapest route and deal with self-transfer) are not available through these distributors, and some, like South West, have blanket refused to be on 3rd party search sites, only starting to relax that position very recently and only with the dominant platform [3]. Kiwi.com has only recently come to a partnership agreement with RyanAir [4] after being in legal battle with them for years [5]. (I hate the thought of having to be at war with your most important partners).<p>Others have mentioned Skyscanner, which was always the closest to us in what we were each trying to offer (we talked briefly with them about being acquired by them).<p>Right from the beginning when we got funded for Adioso, my mind became fixated on the thought &quot;if only you get every single flight in the world loaded into one big graph database, what could you do with it?&quot;, but it turned out to be a very big &quot;if&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;adioso&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;adioso&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amadeus.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;articles&#x2F;creating-a-private-resale-marketplace-to-optimize-carbon-emissions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amadeus.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;articles&#x2F;creating-a-private-resa...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;adioso&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;adioso&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.kiwi.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;kiwi-com-and-ryanair-announce-strategic-partnership" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.kiwi.com&#x2F;company-news&#x2F;kiwi-com-and-ryanair-ann...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.travolution.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;kiwi.com-celebrates-three-wins-in-court-over-ryanair&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.travolution.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;kiwi.com-celebrates-three-w...</a></div><br/><div id="41599742" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41599742" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MichaelZuo</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598559">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41598786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41599742">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41599742">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why would airlines even want penny pinching customers to snag the best deals via a third party?<p>At the very least it would make more sense to let their own frequent flyers snag such deals.</div><br/><div id="41600010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41600010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Ekaros</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598559">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599742">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41598786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41600010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41600010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One reason I could see is to keep perceived price level for the frequent flyers.

Kiwi.com apparently works around this by booking tickets on pools of Ryanair retail accounts, to which they don&#x27;t share the credentials with travelers – making mobile check-in impossible. (And Ryanair at least at the time was charging over 100€ of a &quot;service fee&quot; for a boarding pass print at the airport...)<p>This is only marginally related to booking separate tickets, but I suppose the larger point is that it&#x27;s never a great situation to be stuck between the lines of two companies actively hostile towards each other, when you really depend on their cooperation to get to your destination.<p>&quot;Official&quot; interline agreements are an explicit statement that two or more airlines will make at least some reasonable effort to get you and your luggage to your destination, and will be on the hook for it (under ICAO regulations) if things don&#x27;t work out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41598398" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41598398" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aero-glide2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598381">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41598352">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41598398">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41598398">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Skyscanner</div><br/></div></div><div id="41598352" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41598352" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throawayonthe</span><span>|</span><a href="#41598398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41599238">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41598352">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41598352">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">skiplagged shows you “self-transfer” flight options, which i think solves what OOP was asking</div><br/></div></div><div id="41598815" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41598815" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chriscappuccio</span><span>|</span><a href="#41599238">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41598390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41598815">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41598815">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A web search engine that combines results from different web sites?

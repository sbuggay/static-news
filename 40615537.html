For the extra money you get 5% of the upload + much higher latency. I&#x27;m looking into starting my own ASN just to get IPv6 here.<p>In the US there are millions of locations stuck with IPv4 only networks due to ISPs that are solidly committed to never supporting it.<p>IPv6 evangelists don&#x27;t give a meaningful crap about those millions - and are happy to push IPv6 rosiness in a way that denies their existence.<p>Because of this, IPv6-only services can only ever get so far off the ground. An exciting service is less exciting when it&#x27;s unreachable from point B.</div><br/><div id="40616163" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40616163" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">renewiltord</span><span>|</span><a href="#40615675">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615925">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615619">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40616163">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40616163">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can get a free 4 to 6 tunnel here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tunnelbroker.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tunnelbroker.net&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s really not a big deal.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40615619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40615619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">paulddraper</span><span>|</span><a href="#40615675">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615874">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40615619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40615619">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a lot of drama about irrelevant stuff.<p>The core questions are IP rights and non-compete.

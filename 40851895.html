I mainly manage and review code at this point in my career. I find many bugs, every once in a while finding something that would have caused an outage or notable problem for users.<p>What I find more though is code that isn&#x27;t thought through. Tech debt and code smell are real, and they affect the performance of a team. Nipping that in the bud takes quality PR reviews and time to meet with submitters around issues you find.<p>Knock on wood but working at the company I do now where I, along with my team, have made quality PR reviews normal.. our codebase is now enjoyable and fun to work on. I highly recommend it!<p>One key aspect is being “kind, not nice”. Be helpful when leaving comments in PRs, but don’t be nice for the sake of avoiding conflict.<p>Also if you find code reviews to be a waste of time I can reccomend one thing I do often - give warnings. I approve and give comments around things I’d like to be fixed in the future for similar PRs.

Everyone is happy to smile and nod and the appropriate tickets are filed with deadlines attached, but then the next release rolls around and there&#x27;s new business-imperative stuff that&#x27;s the focus and the cleanup tickets are quietly moved to backlog with the deadlines removed.<p>Seeing this repeated over a number of years has left me with kind of a cynicism about the process, where it feels like code review is at least partly an exercise in frustration; I don&#x27;t have the backing required to insist on doing it right upfront, so instead I&#x27;m really just getting a preview of what is going to land in my lap a year or two from now.</div><br/><div id="40853117" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40853117" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hakunin</span><span>|</span><a href="#40852271">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852681">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852829">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40853117">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40853117">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Couple of points on this.<p>1.

If you have enough people, then from the business perspective it shouldn&#x27;t even be that noticeable that someone is refining previous work, while someone else is building the next thing.<p>2. If you&#x27;re not understaffed, then the best time to clean up new code is during or immediately after writing it. A phrase I like to use is &quot;while it&#x27;s still fresh in memory&quot;.

They are effectively training others by example.<p>- Make sure that code changes under review are reasonably sized.

Because as soon as these people become jaded, your ability to make good PR culture will also vanish. And they can become jaded for many reasons. If these people are not explicitly or implicitly valued, they will know. If people who are doing the incorrect things are getting promoted first (or even at the same rate!), the same raises&#x2F;bonuses, and on all accounts are treated equally, the employee will almost always converge to &quot;well why am I putting in all this extra hard work if it&#x27;s not benefiting me in any way?&quot; And I don&#x27;t think promises of early promotion or similar have a good effect because there&#x27;s many employees who&#x27;ve had those promises made to them and it not follow through[0].

You don&#x27;t have to say it for everything, but I think you&#x27;ll be surprised by how many people have never heard this from management.<p>[0] I wanted to share a story of an instance I had with this. I was a green (mechanical) engineer working at a startup. I had a physics degree instead of a ME, but have always been hands on. But because of this I was paid less and not valued as much. I asked my manager what I would need to do to get promoted and to be on par with everyone else. I got it in writing so I could refer back to it. At my next performance review I was just talked down to. Complaining about how I didn&#x27;t do this or that (sometimes things that were impossible and sometimes they were weird like &quot;your code may have been 20% faster but X couldn&#x27;t understand it so we can&#x27;t use it&quot; -- X was a manager who had only been writing in C++ for &lt; a year and I __heavily__ documented my use of functors). I asked about the things I did and the promises. They admitted I did all of them and even more. One of these being getting a contract (I think they put that there not expecting me to get it), and I was the only non-manager with one, bringing in 20% of company revenue while being the only person on that project. You can imagine I walked out of that meeting polishing up my resume and I was strictly a 9-to-5er doing the bare minimum from that point on. But the next manager I had, was liberal with complements and would critique instead of complain. Understood that there were unknown unknowns and all that and would actually tell me to go home when I was putting in overtime. I never worked harder in my life AND it was the happiest I had been. A manager can make or break an employee. And to part of this is that there may be ways to get back those broken employees, but you might need to figure out why they became broken in the first place. And if it is something you can fix or not. I believe environment has a big impact on employee attitudes and thus, efficiency&#x2F;productivity. If passion is worth 10 IQ points, then happiness is at least a big factor in making an employee productive.

For an external contributor or someone I&#x27;ve never collaborated with (by reviewing code or having my code reviewed), I don&#x27;t accept the code until almost everything is worked out to my satisfaction. With someone I work with regularly, it&#x27;s not uncommon to accept a change with a comment like &quot;this is all good, but you need to take X into account which will change almost everything in this patch&quot; (I exaggerate, but only slightly). I know whether an update could be problematic and whether it is necessary to see it again. Sometimes there are a couple of obvious ways that something could be done, they picked one but weren&#x27;t tied to it if I had a reason for picking a different one, I picked a different one for $REASON.<p>Most are somewhere in between.<p>Though in some ways it works the other way around. For an unfamiliar open source contributor, I need to be confident that the change is worthwhile. I will be lenient on stylistic things, and I&#x27;ll just land their patch and then fix it up afterwards. For someone I&#x27;ve worked with a bunch (whether a familiar contributor or a coworker), I will trust their opinion on the underlying quality of a change, but be less tolerant of unnecessary stylistic differences since they should have already come into alignment on those and it&#x27;s more likely to be an oversight if they missed something.

And what&#x27;s even funny is at surface level the claim that code review &quot;does nothing&quot; __sounds__ ludicrous. But people &quot;believe&quot; because they are annoyed with code review, not because they &quot;actually&quot; believe the results.<p>But statistics are tricky. With the example given in the article &quot;15% of smokers get lung cancer&quot; compared to &quot;80% of people with lung cancer smoke.&quot; These two are not in contradiction with one another but are just different ways to view the same thing. In fact, this is often how people will mislead you (or how you may unintentionally mislead yourself!) with statistics.<p>Another famous example is one that hits HN every once in awhile: &quot;Despite just 5.8% sales, over 38% of bug reports come from the Linux community&quot;[1]. In short this one is about how linux users are just more trained to make bug reports and how most bugs are not system specific. So if you just classify bugs by the architecture of those submitting them, you&#x27;ll actually miss out on a lot of valuable information. And because how statistics work, if the architecture dependence rate was as low as even 50% (I&#x27;d be surprised!) then that&#x27;s still a huge amount of useful bug reports. As a linux user, I&#x27;ve seen these types of bugs, and they aren&#x27;t uncommon. But I&#x27;ve frequently seen them dismissed because I report from a linux system. Or worse, support sends you to their page that requests you to &quot;upvote&quot; a &quot;feature&quot; or bug issue. One you have to login to. I can&#x27;t take a company like that seriously but hell, Spotify did that to me and I&#x27;ve sent them the line of code that was wrong. And Netflix did it to me saying &quot;We don&#x27;t block firefox&quot; but switching user agents gave me access.

They have a frustration that you might not be aware of but they aren&#x27;t aware of all the code and constraints. It can even be in design, which is still important. Very often there is a way to resolve a feature request that is not what the user explicitly asks for. But to do that you have to read between the lines, and carefully. Of course, some people go completely the wrong way with this and <i>cough</i> Apple <i>cough</i> decide that they know what is best for the user. It&#x27;s totally a hard balance to strike, but I think it is very common for it to be framed much simpler.<p>There&#x27;s the joke that the user is dumb, and maybe they are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the issue they face is. It&#x27;s not always dumb when a person pulls on a door that says push, because it may actually be that the sign and design are saying different things[0].

I might throw that in the garbage, but it can often give me better context clues as to what they&#x27;re trying to ask for and really does tell me if they&#x27;re thinking hard about the problem that they care about the product.

Since they require involvement of people, code reviewing is often the longest part of the code integration activities. Using experience gained at Microsoft and with support of data, we posit (1) that code reviews often do not find functionality issues that should block a code submission; (2) that effective code reviews should be performed by people with specific set of skills; and (3) that the social aspect of code reviews cannot be ignored. We find that we need to be more sophisticated with our guidelines for the code review workflow. We show how our findings from code reviewing practice influence our code review tools at Microsoft. Finally, we assert that, due to its costs, code reviewing practice is a topic deserving to be better understood, systematized and applied to software engineering workflow with more precision than the best practice currently prescribes.<p>“Code Reviews Do Not Find Bugs:

The statistic cited by the article that 15% of comments were about a bug seems in line with expectations, and I think it would only really be worth discussing if the number were _much higher_ or _much lower_.<p>Instead, I think there are two far more interesting questions to ask:<p>1. Is the rate at which code review identifies defects sufficient to use code review as a detection mechanism for defects?<p>After nearly 20 years of writing software, I&#x27;m pretty convinced that the answer here is no. Some reviewers are better than others, and some circumstances are more favorable to finding defects than others, but we should generally try to build processes that don&#x27;t assume defects will be caught at a substantial rate by code review. It&#x27;s nice when it works, but it&#x27;s not a reliable enough way to catch errors to be a load bearing part of the process.<p>2. Is mandatory review of all code justified?<p>This is the one I&#x27;m on the fence about. In an environment where code reviews are high priority, people are trained to review effectively, and there are minimal organizational politics at play, then I hypothesize that allowing PR authors to decide whether to get a review or not would generally improve quality and velocity because code would ship more quickly and code that would benefit from a review would still be reviewed. In that scenario, I think we&#x27;d see the benefits of getting things shipped more quickly when they don&#x27;t require a review, and reviews would be higher quality because code being flagged for review would be a positive sign to pay more attention.<p>Unfortunately, I could be wrong, and it&#x27;s not the sort of experiment anyone wants to risk their reputation pushing for, so I doubt we&#x27;re likely to see an experiment at a large enough scale to know for sure.

The reason it is a trick is because in many cases the alternative isn&#x27;t placebo, it is an existing treatment. Then doctors learn about a more &quot;modern&quot; treatment, favor it for being modern and the better treatment may not be prescribed.<p>The alternatives to code review aren&#x27;t doing nothing. The article claims that code reviews find a defect per 10 minutes--but only in the first ten minutes. By this same argument (ignore qualifications, extrapolate the numeric result), fast automated testing can potentially find thousands of defects in a second--if they run that quickly and the defects were already tested for. Static analysers, pair programming, documentation these are all alternatives and there are many more.<p>If you&#x27;re spending an hour a day reviewing code then you are spending 12.5% of your time doing it. Using it that way comes with an opportunity cost that may be better spent depending on your particular organization and code base. Of course, analysing everything to death also has an opportunity cost, but not analysing it generally leads to moving goal posts where the supposed rationale for doing something keeps changing. Today its purpose is uncovering defects, tomorrow it is knowledge sharing, the day after it is security. It is all of those things, but other practices may achieve these goals with more effective use of time and people&#x27;s patience.<p>So why am I pro code review? Because choosing to interact and work together as a team, to learn about and compromise with your colleagues makes for good team building while serving other technical purposes. I do think that pair programming can achieve this to a greater level while also being more taxing on individuals. This assumes you control the process and own it though, if it has just become a rote ceremony then my feelings are you probably aren&#x27;t net benefitting from it: you are simply doing it because you have no choice, not because you believe it to be a valuable use of time. If you have experienced both, a culture where people choose and find value in code reviews and a culture where people are forced to do it unquestioningly, then you may have witnessed how a dicta can destroy the prosocial value of a practice.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40852544" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40852544" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">david2ndaccount</span><span>|</span><a href="#40854260">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40852691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40852544">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40852544">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience, code reviews catch a lot of bugs.

Cheap planes and telecoms let people shuffle all over the planet, and the ones who will live and die in the same city or town where they were born will forever be fewer and fewer. Paris <i>has</i> its people - the people who choose to live there today. They might not look or talk like Napoleonic Parisians, but so what? Paris as a whole still feels very much alive and inhabited in pretty much every corner.<p>I think the problem is that you have an idea of Paris in your mind and refuse to accept that reality does not match it (and probably never did - literature is never a perfect mirror, since it will reflect an author&#x27;s view rather than reality).<p>Venice has a different problem. The historic centre is literally dying out: nobody wants to put up with the annoying logistics anymore, and buildings are more profitable when used by tourists; so the &quot;locals&quot; (as in long-time residents; many of them were not born there) choose to live on land instead, in Mestre (which keeps growing). What is left is indeed largely a museum, an open-air tourist trap. This is well-understood and nominally opposed by local politicians, but it&#x27;s unlikely that these macro-trends can be significantly reversed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40616161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40616161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">realusername</span><span>|</span><a href="#40615658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615862">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615839">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40616161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40616161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; People who lived there for generations.<p>Yes and no, Paris was an economic powerhouse even back then and attracted a lot of workers from the nearby regions,</div><br/></div></div><div id="40615839" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40615839" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grondilu</span><span>|</span><a href="#40615658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40616161">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615992">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40615839">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40615839">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Friendly reminder that &quot;Paris syndrome&quot; is a thing:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_syndrome" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_syndrome</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40615992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40615992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eastbound</span><span>|</span><a href="#40615658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615839">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40615837">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40615992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40615992">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just a reminder of historical milestones for Paris:<p>- 1789 The revolution, which lasted a decade, Louis XVI being guillotined in 1793, and the entire 1800 being busy with Napoleon, Restauration of monarchy, then Napoleon III,<p>- 1880 Haussmann refurbishes Paris. Think of the writings of Zola and Victor Hugo. Every grandiose avenue, every beautiful building, every train station comes from that period. Gare d’Orsay (now a museum) with 15 tracks and its magnificent glass ceiling is built in just 2 years, along with a dozen kilometers of rails under the river’s level. Yeah imagine that today, they can’t even build a cycle lane in 2 years. Orsay was just built for Exposition Universelle then shut down like 10 years later.<p>- 1889 Exposition universelle where the Eiffel tower is built. Paris is truly the capital of the world, everyone comes to see it, Paris and France are able to execute grand plans in just a few years. The Russian cour of the tsar speaks French because it’s classy, President Poincare forms an alliance with Russia and visits Saint Pétersbourg in 1913.<p>- XXth century: Nothing really happened in Paris (with the exception of May 1968, the local version of the worldwide cultural changes about freedom of the youths of the 1970ies, feminism, anticonservatism, etc). The entire history of the world happened in Berlin, the gay bars in 1934, the Nazis, the Russian rapes after the occupation, the 40-year wall, the Weidervereinigung in 1989, the EU in the 2000s… Berlin truely was the capital of the world’s events for an entire century.<p>- 2024 The Olympic Games in Paris. Pay close attention to the events, it will tell you what Paris wants to be.<p>What would you say will be the capital of the world for the next 50 years? I’d say San Francisco, because so much of our world is dictated by our startups’ community policies.

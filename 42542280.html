Notes is fundamentally a programmable, non-relational, client&#x2F;server replicated database with a UI on top of it. It&#x27;s a workflow engine for accomplishing whatever business processes a company might have that can be made to keep working pretty well when the client computer is offline. It can be anything.<p>But it is remembered first and foremost as an email system, a feature that&#x27;s fairly trivial to implement once you have a replicated database and a UI on top of it that can display lists and text.

But instead IBM bought both and merged them. It got kinda lost from there, while also getting way bigger, but that is a different story.<p>Even so, it did have some app templates that came with it back in those early days - a helpdesk ticketing system, a sales CRM, discussions.

E.g. if there&#x27;s already an established market for engines or frameworks, then a business can use your conforming engine almost plug-and-play.

We (the initial amzn team of bezos, myself and shel kaphan) were certainly not looking at any others that I recall besides bookstacks who had a telnet-based online bookstore.<p>I think people overlook the role of luck here. Bezos was simultaneously very smart but also incredibly lucky to be &quot;the guy who was doing books on the web&quot;. It really was the ideal product for the first large scale online retail, and Bezos brought a lot of imagination and energy to the effort. But if it had not have been him, it would have been someone else, who likely would have been more or less as successful.<p>Personally, I think that Bezos&#x27; relentless focus on customer service was the biggest factor in amzn&#x27;s early success, combined with his near-insane quality standards for the people he was willing to hire.</div><br/><div id="42545091" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42545091" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kragen</span><span>|</span><a href="#42544480">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42545020">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42544800">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42545091">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42545091">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What was the &quot;lucky&quot; part?  The article claims that Bezos learned that web usage was growing 2300% a year (public knowledge), decided to sell stuff on the web, made a list of 20 potential products, and decided that books were the one where an online store could best compete.  Is that wrong?  It makes it sound like the particular way Bezos was lucky was by happening to be smart, smarter than the rest of us who were paying attention to what was going on.

He wasn&#x27;t smarter than the rest of us. Had Shaw not asked him to research possible online opportunities, he may never have come up with the concept at all.

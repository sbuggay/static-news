Not every day. Not all day. But I am sure many people like me read of the risks now, and worry what we&#x27;ve been exposed to unbeknownst (it was casually sold to us as &quot;the safer option&quot; although nobody would have said safer meant totally safe)<p>More weed tolerant forms of food production are also not risk free: There&#x27;s been a small outbreak of poisoning from immature non-spinach leaking into the crop for bagged baby spinach sold in the supermarkets. Cross contamination with unexpected plant material poses some risks.<p>Another systemic poison &quot;Confidor&quot; was bloody good at keeping bugs off our plants but always came with &quot;you can&#x27;t eat anything afterward&quot; which was a painful lesson in what it takes to kill a modern mite. It&#x27;s mostly off the market now too. Chlorpyriphos was used for Cockroaches and other bugs as a surface spray, &quot;your kid would have to lick the walls to be affected&quot; they said: now, banned for domestic use.

It&#x27;s in that category of chemicals where possible effects show up at the limits of detection for very high dose exposures. It&#x27;s either weakly carcinogenic or that&#x27;s just noise. Of course many chemicals, quite a few of them natural, are in that same class.

How the risk of getting cancer grows if one eats glyphosate? How does it compare to other factors, like pollution, obesity, etc.<p>We used to have a similar discussion about contraceptive pills, at some point there was research that they increase probability of getting cancer by 30%. Holy crap, 30%!!!<p>Sounds horrible, right? Some political groups that call themselves &quot;right wing&quot; pick this subject up immediately.<p>The point is that you calculate this 30% out of a very small probability value and, as a result, it is negligible if you look on other factors like smoking, bad food, pollution, alcohol or drugs usage or genetic factors. They increase getting cancer by thousands percent, so, in practice, contraceptives influence is not practically important, as it might affect just a few cases out of millions.<p>Same with herbicides. What if we stop using them, are we able to stop the biggest killer from old times, various fungus, that grow on plant, are not visible but very toxic. Does the risk of consuming glyphosates is that big so we can drop it and risk something else?<p>How about prices, food will be more expensive, people in Europe will perceive themselves poorer and will riot. Bollocks! What an absurd claim, you say, Europeans are rich as they&#x27;ve never been!<p>Objectively this is true, the point is people are not objective - see what happens in Germany, one of the richest countries on our planet. People got more expensive gas &amp; oil and what happens? See how much popularity gets NSDAP reconstruction group, called AfD (in the polls they have 20% and still growing).<p>Is the cancer risk enough to justify a risk of getting us into political rumbles Western Europe hasn&#x27;t seen since 1939?<p>And so on, this is not simple if you deal with something that might affect millions.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37640935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37640935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oulipo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37640874">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37640935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37640935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Shameful</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

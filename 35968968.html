It&#x27;s obviously true that an open source project can have good coding standards with multiple contributors of different skill levels, but you get there by managing the project really well.<p>And while more engineers can mean that an individual engineer is slower, the idea is that with good management and engineering the aggregate output can increase with each engineer (i.e. Having 10 engineers who only work at 25% of the pace of a standalone engineer will still output 2.5x as much as a single engineer.

But one needs to switch the framing from universal truths about team organization to psychology.<p>I can relate to the situation quite closely because I think it&#x27;s the same overall situation that I find myself in.  I might be totally off the mark here because, like anyone, I can&#x27;t read minds, but let me engage in some speculation.<p>The ability to have truly peer-to-peer relationships that are not based on any one side dominating the other is very rare.  One needs to have a highly developed psyche to be capable of such relationships, so only a small minority of people have this ability.  The vast majority of all human relationships work on a &quot;dominate or be dominated&quot; principle.<p>If you consistently find yourself on the losing end of power struggle, you start to see everyone as a threat to your autonomy.  The result is that you work alone.  Obviously, that&#x27;s extremely limiting, and, for myself, I find it extremely painful to try to develop through that.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35972634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35972634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bayindirh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35971952">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35972129">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35972080">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35972634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35972634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Er... reading this, I would rather suspect the author of &quot;not being a team player&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d respectfully disagree on this.

I have also experienced people that do better, more accurate and resonable work when they work together with someone else, because they will anticipate the other seeing their code.<p>The quoted passage tells me one thing: If you invite people to work on your project, no matter if it is a film, a garden party or a software product, the right casting is crucial. Don&#x27;t invite people that won&#x27;t understand the thing you&#x27;re doing, and if you absolutely have to make sure there is something in it for them when they do their own job well and see your thing succeeding — but the crucial thing is, you should always know what is in it for the other person.<p>As someone who has been on a number of amateur film sets where nobody got paid the ones that really sucked where the ones where the initiator treated everybody like dumb paid labour that should just do as they were told, pushing people that might have cared into actively sabotaging the project.<p>If you want people to care about your project it is <i>your</i> task to find people who do and it is <i>your</i> task to keep them there, if they are needed for the project.<p>And very often that means not doing it 100% dictator-style, but letting people play and evolve within their own domain.

Years ago (more than I&#x27;d like to admit), I took to playing Travian with friends and coworkers. Travian is an RTS, where &#x27;Realtime&#x27; really means &#x27;Real-Time&#x27;! If you attack the town next to you, just a few squares away, it can take 5 hours for your troops to arrive and the battle to ensue.<p>It was the perfect game; you could play it casually, in between stuff at work during the day, or on break, or in the evening.<p>My friends started getting really into it and spending a lot more time on it. I did not want to spend more time playing it, but it was a fun game. The makers of Travian did something interesting, though - they would dump one database table with city data every night for people to do interesting things with. My friends were using a bunch of these tools already, but I perceived some opportunity to build tools which didn&#x27;t yet exist - like a tool which let you discover inactive accounts to pillage. I starting building more and more tools, eventually starting to write a bot to play the game for me, by automatically raiding inactive accounts and automatically building up my current towns to avoid appearing inactive. My goal in doing this wasn&#x27;t to play the game per se, but to learn and get better at programming.<p>So I made the mistake of mentioning all this to another friend who was playing Travian. He was interested. I told him if I ever finished, he could try out the bot, but in the meantime he could use the rest of my tools.<p>Well, he got impatient waiting for the bot (which btw, I never finished, but I did learn some cool stuff from the experience). He decided he was going to &#x27;help&#x27; me, by group calling me with another programmer friend of his who first of all quizzed me on how I was building it, and telling me I was doing it the wrong way and that I needed to use different languages, frameworks, messaging layers, etc. Yeah, so now that I am way further in my career, that guy was dead wrong and an idiot who was trying to overcomplicate everything. But the point was - he didn&#x27;t want to help, he wanted to stroke his own ego by fixing (or as the case may be, fucking up) some other idiot&#x27;s project.<p>This actually really strained my relationship with my friend. Huge dick move, and one that took me a long time to forgive him for. Stay out of my personal projects! To me, it felt along the lines of hearing about an argument with my wife, and then unbidden forcing me to take a call with a relationship coach who told me I was a bad husband.</div><br/><div id="35970802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35970802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asdfman123</span><span>|</span><a href="#35970009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35971692">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35970802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35970802">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; he didn&#x27;t want to help, he wanted to stroke his own ego by fixing (or as the case may be, fucking up) some other idiot&#x27;s project<p>Maybe that’s just the way he approaches problems.

It’s certainly not impossible, and id rather put in effort to manage team(s) than to place an increasingly insurmountable amount of pressure on myself.<p>Perhaps the reason the author’s project has “few users” is that there are competing alternatives that have authors who understand how to leverage team work to deliver more value to users, and users go where they perceive value.<p>Also, if you worked for an organization that actually hired (and retained) people with malice intent, i dont think team size was the real issue. In that sense i do agree with the author that you should screen anyone and ensure your goals align before agreeing to invest time in trying to work together. If someone is offering to add a feature you dont think fits in the project, i have a hard time characterizing that as “malice intent”, though!</div><br/><div id="35970134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35970134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">foobar1962</span><span>|</span><a href="#35969916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35972587">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35970134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35970134">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; The author seems to propose it is impossible for large teams to be productive.<p>Not productive, efficient.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35972587" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35972587" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lofaszvanitt</span><span>|</span><a href="#35969916">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35972392">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35972587">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35972587">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everyone cares about himself and everyone wants the limelight for himself.

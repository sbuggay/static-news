What is the reasonable expectation of a business to profit off a product that we’ve deemed “required”? Who would make or support a product they can’t profit on?<p>We kind of urgently need new models for certain things that start as for-profit and then fade towards more publicly owned utilities.  This is the essence of the idea behind things like patents and copyright, and when we&#x27;re talking about a <i>service</i> where the creators have been wildly successful the basic issues are mostly the same.  Fair compensation, but not ownership in perpetuity.  The thing about maps and similar is, it&#x27;s not an idea to be protected because the idea is the easy part but the data is hard.  Since google did some part of the actual mapping, they certainly deserve credit, but of course the whole thing could not exist if GPS wasn&#x27;t essentially available as a public utility.  Maybe if they want to be stingy with the map data <i>forever</i>, they should pay license fees for the GPS technology, since that&#x27;s a piece of infrastructure they outsource to the public?  Or for our individual data, since it&#x27;s required to build their models?<p>Regardless of your stance on political&#x2F;economic ideology, surely individuals can agree that it&#x27;s not sustainable for society to be beholden to for-profit corporations forever for things like maps, the ability to use a flashlight or a toaster, the ability to open doors on houses or cars you own, or access to water&#x2F;air.  Maintenance is a real issue for most technology even after it&#x27;s figured out, so probably the corporations should be forced towards spinning off actually separated co-ops&#x2F;nonprofits&#x2F;utilities in the fullness of time.<p>So basically wild profits and all the awful antisocial and anti-competitive behaviour you can get away with, but having some explicit expiration date for service-monopoly as well as idea-monopoly.  And as for the question of motivation.. does it <i>really</i> disincentivize creative crooks to know that the next generation of crooks will need a new scam?

He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained.<p>This is pretty misleading. You can see the location information your device sent to google, but you can&#x27;t see or delete the assumptions that google has made about you based on that data. A list of GPS coordinates showing where you frequently go on Saturday nights isn&#x27;t what people are concerned about Google having. The fact that those GPS coordinates show that you spend hours at, for example, a gay bar is more of an issue. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you delete the list of GPS coordinates from your google account because what you can&#x27;t delete is the &quot;This user is gay and often goes to gay bars on Saturdays&quot; flag that google put there the instant they got that data.

It&#x27;s also our cell phone companies, the random cameras and license plate&#x2F;toll transponder readers we pass by, our &quot;smart&quot; cars, etc. There&#x27;s so much tracking going on that the typically American has zero control over at all, but which police (and others) could tap into.

You can anonymously post on HN (or similar tech-oriented forums) with proof and it would be enough to get the ball rolling.<p>I&#x27;d bet that very few people would have the kind of access to see what violations of people&#x27;s privacy are taking place and that proof someone posted to social media (besides a massive leak of innocent people&#x27;s personal data) may not be verifiable by anyone other than google employees or regulators&#x2F;government who could get into Google&#x27;s internal systems.<p>I suppose that they could if there was a lie_to_public_about_data_collection() function in Android&#x27;s source code or a massive store of location data that shouldn&#x27;t exist just sitting unencrypted on our devices and being transmitted to google unencrypted, but other situations would be much less clear.<p>For example, when you open Google maps, you&#x27;d fully expect that your location would be sent to google. You&#x27;d also expect that google wouldn&#x27;t keep that information tied to your account if you&#x27;d opted out of that tracking in your account settings. If google were keeping a copy of that location data on an internal server somewhere, associated with your dossier, but not made visible to users (or even most google employees) what proof would you expect to see posted to HN that we could verify for ourselves? Screenshots of the database&#x2F;internal tool&#x2F;documentation might be good, but screenshots can be faked and since we don&#x27;t have access to the database, or the server deep inside google that hosts it, or their internal documentation we&#x27;d be unable to say for sure if it the screenshots were real.<p>Companies are using all kinds of tricks these days to catch whistleblowers like logging anyone who accesses sensitive information and adding hidden watermarks to documents and images. Just going to social media or the press could be very risky.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40959661" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40959661" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">not1ofU</span><span>|</span><a href="#40958590">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40958836">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40959675">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40958957">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40959661">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40959661">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;You can anonymously post on HN&quot; - New account? flagged &#x2F; green &#x2F; unvouched and HN will still be able to connect the account unless &lt;extra work&gt;.

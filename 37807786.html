But the counterpoint to the linked article is that he was about 30 metres from the epicentre of the Omagh bombing, and the minidisc recorder in his pocket did significant damage to his abdomen and still worked perfectly afterwards.

For some reason, I&#x27;ve noticed this &quot;design quirk&quot; far more in various import products than domestic ones.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to read statements like this:<p><i>The DSP and control IC&#x27;s in new Sony recorders e.g. MZ-R90&#x2F;91 cannot be removed from the board due to a packaging design in which the pins are mounted under the chips and cannot be accessed for de-soldering.

Sort of worked.  Didn&#x27;t even have solder tape, just a sucker.<p>I didn&#x27;t even understand how a hot air station worked, until youtube showed me years later (I moved onto the software side).  The things people could never find out, never know, never even knew existed pre-Internet are staggering.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone under 30 can even begin to comprehend how limited knowledge was before.  Quite often, if you wanted to know something, you <i>literally</i> could not find any info about it at all.

I&#x27;d love to get another one, but prices are high and reliability is poor. While they worked, they were really great for recording, and decent for listening to music, but today I&#x27;m using simple digital recorders that write MP3 and FLAC to SD cards and it&#x27;s hard to beat them for reliability.

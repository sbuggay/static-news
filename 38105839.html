All modern pharmaceutical companies heavily leverage computational tools - including some powered by deep learning.<p>Any company building a computational platform to accelerate drug discovery &#x2F; development is not a pharmaceutical company. They are a software company who wants to sell software to pharmaceutical companies, which is a terrible business to be in.<p>The product the author is selling already exists for free.  All of the big knowledge bases use automated ML tooling for curation and extraction. And the people who run them and QC them are world class experts in their domains. I mean, just take a look at uniprot.[0]<p>And the only types of pharma companies who would want a big knowledge graph would be the large ones with active programs across multiple therapeutic areas.  Most of the small companies &#x2F; start ups tend to be focused on getting one or two assets to market in a therapeutic domain. And the big companies possibly have their own ML teams doing literature extraction - because a team of 5-10 FTE ML &#x2F; software engineers is like a rounding error in their R&amp;D budget.<p>The other thing is that the most valuable knowledge is the stuff that is not in the literature.  That’s why we do experiments.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;nar&#x2F;article&#x2F;51&#x2F;D1&#x2F;D523&#x2F;6835362" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;nar&#x2F;article&#x2F;51&#x2F;D1&#x2F;D523&#x2F;6835362</a></div><br/><div id="38108126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38108126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">w10-1</span><span>|</span><a href="#38107621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38109767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38108126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38108126">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ingenuity&#x27;s Pathway Analysis product has been the standard tool big pharma has used for 15+ years.  Founded by folks from Stanford, they created their own knowledge-graph database a decade before they were popular, and have been paying PhD&#x27;s to curate that database with genetic findings from papers over the last decades.  Obviously their analysis also includes the publicly-available databases, and they have their own private genomic databases and expertise from helping many of the first-available genomic services go live.<p>Still, it&#x27;s a tough business, and they were bought by Qiagen (to make an end-to-end solution, with moderate success, as the market is strangled by Illumina&#x27;s control over NGS sequencing).  And with exponential growth in information, their early relative advantage likely has waned.<p>Also note Veeva software, which provides infrastructure for pharma, is a public benefit company, legally devoted to its clients.  That&#x27;s how much power the customer has.<p>That said, there&#x27;s something of a revolution in drug discovery as more is being done by small companies with ultra-focused expertise.  If they get a viable candidate, a bigger company buys it to marshal through approvals, and then it can be sold again to a marketing company.  Focusing on these pop-up drug-discovery companies that evolve out of someone&#x27;s PhD could be a good niche; I would expect Pharma VC&#x27;s to prefer funding companies using their favorite computing vendor, for reliability if not insight.  Here computational discovery assistance would help a bit, but validating findings and science could be golden.</div><br/><div id="38108263" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38108263" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pfisherman</span><span>|</span><a href="#38107621">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38108126">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38109767">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38108263">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38108263">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the big case study everybody gives is Schrödinger who took 20 years to IPO.<p>The problem is that the market is just not that big.

I&#x27;ve been thinking a bit about taking some computational insights we have developed over years to bioinformatics.<p>During my Ph.D., my PI wanted to do some work on signalling pathway analysis. He was interested in knowing when and why sometimes body starts assuming that the sick state is the right state and start acting against drugs given to patients. This making treatment very hard.<p>I don&#x27;t know what is status of that but one insight I got from him that most (all?) Pharma companies do not trust acdemic data. I didn&#x27;t ask reasons but I&#x27;d assume because of replication issue (crisis).

The well-meaning and hard-working author went through several iterations of trying to make a profit on &#x27;academic-knowledge-graph-adjacent&#x27; products, but things ultimately fell through.<p>The article describes two separate things likely to appeal to HN readers. The first is that there is a lot of tacit knowledge not captured in scientific publications. The second is that the author and his team, despite best efforts, never found product-market fit.<p>To the first point: it wasn&#x27;t until I got to graduate school that I realized that the scientific literature isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;An accurate record of true facts.&#x27; It is instead the paper-trail of a slow-moving conversation among researchers, where old ideas are slowly jettisoned and new ideas are evaluated and tried on.<p>To the second point, a few reactions:<p>* If your primary market &#x2F; audience is graduate students or post-docs, good luck! You can&#x27;t sell to people who don&#x27;t have money: grad students are paid around minimum wage, postdocs its slightly better. If I had to sell a science or research-adjacent product, I&#x27;d either sell to entire departments or colleges &#x2F; campuses. This is likely a pretty protracted sales process and doesn&#x27;t seem pleasant.<p>* I wonder if Law would be a better place to start. Either selling to law-firms directly (building tools for generating internal knowledge graphs when they are given 80k documents in the discovery process), or particularly for IP lawyers. IP lawyers have the money and expertise to have their skills augmented by AI-powered literature searches. I have to imagine it&#x27;s not just patents they read when looking for prior art.<p>* I wonder if the author and his team tried to solve too broad of a problem: they never seem to have gotten hyper-specific, and built something from the bottom up.</div><br/><div id="38108532" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38108532" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Al-Khwarizmi</span><span>|</span><a href="#38107117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38107382">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38108532">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38108532">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Academic here.<p>To be honest, while the author&#x27;s depiction of academic publishing is mostly not wrong, they make it sound much worse than it actually is.

Not only grad students and postdoc wages are low, in many countries (not the US) professors aren&#x27;t well paid either (and buying software subscriptions from grant funds is often not allowed or difficult due to crazy bureaucracy).<p>As a full professor myself, I almost don&#x27;t buy software for work. I suffer the torture of Microsoft Office, which my institution is subscribed to, I&#x27;m subscribed to Overleaf with grant money (for now, but I might be forced to cancel depending on how the funding goes) and I pay for ChatGPT out of pocket because trying to use grant money for that is bureaucratic hell.

The book was popular in the 19th century, and two of the protagonists were the source, a century later, of the names of the cartoon characters Tom and Jerry [2]. It’s a cleverly written work and I enjoyed reading it a few years ago, but the density of the slang and topical references can make it difficult to parse today. An excerpt:<p>‘Tom’s box at the Opera caused many a languishing eye and palpitating heart to wander towards its elegant owner. His <i>stroll</i> through the Theatres caused a different sensation among another class of females, and no lures were neglected to decoy and entrap him. In the Parks, Tom was the GO among the “goes!” His <i>peep</i> into the <i>Stews</i> were merely <i>en passant;</i> and the knowing, enticing, Mother Dish-<i>up’s</i> something “<i>new</i>” was tried on in vain to “have the best” of our Hero only for a single <i>darkey!</i> Upon his descending into the <i>Hells,</i> if he did not prove himself as troublesome an inmate as the <i>dramatic</i> Don Giovanni, or possess the icy qualities of Signor Antonelli, the fire-eater and hornpipe-dancer upon red-hot iron bars, he nevertheless had found out the secret, —which, if it did not altogether prevent him from being <i>scorched</i> a little, yet saved him from being <i>burnt to death!</i> At Newmarket, Epsom, and Doncaster Races, Tom was viewed as the <i>tulip</i> of the turf. He not only took the shine out of the <i>Prime Ones</i> at <i>Tattersal’s,</i> but his <i>nod</i> for decision of judgement was the <i>fiat</i> of taste. In showing himself at the <i>Fives-Court,</i> all the <i>peepers</i> of the <i>Fancy</i> were on the stretch to <i>ogle</i> his beau-ideal form and appearance.’ [3]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;search?query=title%3A%28Life%20in%20London%29%20AND%20creator%3A%28Pierce%20Egan%29%20AND%20mediatype%3A%28texts%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;search?query=title%3A%28Life%20in%20Lond...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_and_Jerry#History" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tom_and_Jerry#History</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;bub_gb_505pL_b9D2IC&#x2F;page&#x2F;n111&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;bub_gb_505pL_b9D2IC&#x2F;page&#x2F;n111&#x2F;mo...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37841446" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37841446" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">resolutebat</span><span>|</span><a href="#37840905">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37841161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37841446">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37841446">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>On the other hand, the people he refers to as pickpockets and cat burglars are rarely thieving guilds, but simply racial or ethnic others. “In Finland, the fellows who steal seal skins, pick the pockets of bear-skin overcoats, and talk Cant, are termed Lappes.”</i><p>Lappi = Lapland, the northern region of not just Finland but Sweden and Norway, and <i>lappalaiset</i> is a derogatory term for the Sami people who live there.<p>That said, there are no seals anywhere near Finnish waters (except a few very rare freshwater seals) and neither has wearing a &quot;bearskin coat&quot; even been close to a normal thing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37841161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37841161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">distortedsignal</span><span>|</span><a href="#37841446">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37840518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37841161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37841161">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Now we have urban dictionary.</div><br/><div id="37842039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37842039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">derefr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37841161">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37840518">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37842039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37842039">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For English-language words.

Also neat how this bridge between the two topics of archaic language and slang is the same one that I cover in my viral tiktok[2], which retells ancient stories traditionally associated with archaic language but in modern slang. There&#x27;s really nothing about slang that makes it less official than less informal language. Dictionaries don&#x27;t define language but document its usage. And universities don&#x27;t define language but study it.<p>[1]: immaculatalibrary.com<p>[2]: @gen.z.bible.stories</div><br/></div></div><div id="37840976" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37840976" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aaron695</span><span>|</span><a href="#37840518">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37840976">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37840976">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">TL;DR what everyone wants to know  - &#x27;cant&#x27; is <i>not</i> ye olde speak for &#x27;cunt&#x27;.<p>From the book [1] -<p><pre><code>  Cant is old; Slang is always modern and changing. To illustrate the difference: a thief in Cant language would term a horse a prancer or a prad,—while in slang, a man of fashion would speak of it as a bit of blood, or a spanker, or a neat tit. A handkerchief, too, would be a billy, a fogle, or a kent rag, in the secret language of low characters,—whilst amongst vulgar persons, or those who aped their speech, it would be called a rag, a wipe, or a clout.

  Cant was formed for purposes of secrecy. Slang is indulged in from a desire to appear familiar with life, gaiety, town-humour, and with the transient nick names and street jokes of the day. Both Cant and Slang, I am aware, are often huddled together as synonymes, but they are distinct terms, and as such should be used.

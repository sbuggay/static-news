It&#x27;s their creative &amp; clever designs that get them attention and career incentives.”</i><p>This is a massive change from my first software industry job in 1997.<p>I was essentially a “design intern who knows HTML” on a team that built a shrinkwrap Windows application for enterprises. The core of the design team was a graphic designer, a cognitive scientist, an industrial designer, and a product manager with industry experience in the customer domain.<p>The application was Windows native. User research was conducted on site with scientific rigor. Adhering to platform guidelines and conventions was a priority. I think I spent a few weeks redrawing hundreds of toolbar icons so they’d be in line with the Office 97 look (the kind of boring job you give to the junior). If the app stood out on the Windows desktop, that would have been considered problematic.<p>Today a similar design team would only have a graphic designer and a PM, and neither of them would care the slightest about platform guidelines or customer domain. The UI is primarily an extension of the corporate brand. Hiring a cognitive scientist? Forget about it…<p>Everything certainly wasn’t perfect in the Windows&#x2F;Mac desktop golden era. But the rise of the web wiped out a lot of good industry practices too.</div><br/><div id="36382593" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36382593" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilyt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36382057">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36382179">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36382328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36382593">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36382593">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Remember times where you could change the theme and all of the apps followed suit ?<p>Even in Linux there were tools to sync gnome with QT look so you could have one theme applied to every app for nice and consistent look, all the way to how the common icons look.<p>Nowadays ?

Think of Slack&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;VSCode&#x2F;etc. Sure: Qt, Flutter, etc also have web versions, but they just don&#x27;t look&#x2F;feel as good in the browser as an HTML app normally can.<p>If you want a &quot;Premium&quot; native look and feel, people gotta go directly to the source: native APIs.

Or they go directly to HTML when there&#x27;s not enough cash (or even things like Flutter, which look ok in mobile).

My take is significantly more top-down: senior management has a deficient concept of how product development works.  They believe Manpower is to be spent to achieve revenue, either by directly selling the result as a product (e.g. airplanes selling wifi to passengers) or by it being a differentiating feature for the sales department.  This causes every allocation decision (like hiring) to fundamentally be biased around getting a tangible return: by creating new projects, new features, and new buggy microservices.<p>Further, since management only has two knobs (manpower and timeline) to play with, they like to move them to feel like they&#x27;re optimizing the project.  It&#x27;s always the same fallacies, too: &quot;we hired more people so we can create explosive growth&quot;, &quot;we created ambitious timelines, now we&#x27;re striving to fill them&quot; etc.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution for this, except to note that it can be mitigated by managing up.

One would argue that you should write documentation so that people will use your thing.  That&#x27;s true!  But there is almost no incentive to have users; you pay a cost, but they pay nothing in return.  (Someone will send a bugfix now and again, of course, but it&#x27;s very very rare.)<p>Some other incentives are balanced, though.  Persistent low performance or bugginess affects the author and end users equally; the more the author uses their own software, the more this will hurt.  Sometimes the low performance is a design trade off; Python isn&#x27;t Rust, and the users seem to be okay with that.  It was done on purpose.  Sometimes low performance is a factor of the author&#x27;s needs; you&#x27;re trying to run the thing on 1 billion machines, they only have 1; something has got to give.  But that&#x27;s not misaligned incentives so much as it is lack of suitability for a particular purpose.  A screwdriver is terrible for hammering in nails.

We were creating a page that was going to use state in a certain way.  I was trying to insist that we address the way state will be handled across pages ahead of time.  These concerns were dismissed as premature optimization.  A few months later we had 5 pages with the state being handled in 5 different ways, and being synced in different ways between each page, complete with if statements, sometimes passing state through URLs, sometimes through local storage, sometimes through session, sometimes through JWT data, generally through a combo of several of them.  Then we&#x27;d end up with confusing redirect loops for certain edge cases, state getting overwritten, etc..  We spend weeks fixing these bugs, and, eventually, weeks refactoring to manage state in a simpler way.  These bugs often got caught by customers, drawing us away from feature delivery that was critical for demos to large customers.<p>All of that could have been avoided by spending 1 day thinking a little harder and planning for the future.<p>It ultimately boils down to a couple assumption that people like to make. 
 (1) engineers know nothing about the domain, they can never predict what will be needed.  That might be true in a large company with obscure domain-specific things for engineers who work far away from the day-to-day, but sometimes the engineers know exactly what&#x27;s going to come up. (2) You can hill-climb your way into optimal program implementation.  You can get to local maxima this way, but there are regular ways that programs grow based on how the business is growing and you can predict certain places where you will soon hit diminishing returns for current implementations.  As long as you&#x27;re up front about it and double-check your assumptions about the way the business is growing (and hence the application), I think there are ample places where you actually are going to need it.</div><br/><div id="36383716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36383716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pydry</span><span>|</span><a href="#36381745">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36383358">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36384791">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36383716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36383716">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;I can give you an abundance of examples.

The first half is a maybe reasonable description of a common way for certain kinds of contracts to go wrong. But obviously lots of software doesn’t get developed in this sort of arms-length way. I would say that imaginary problems (as the author defines them) cause failed projects by consultants&#x2F;contractors.<p>I find the rest of the article to be bizarre. The discussion around retail banking software seems unacceptably incurious and a very likely incorrect diagnosis of the cause of the problems (it basically stoops to an ‘I could do that in a weekend’ level of criticism[1]). It then transitions to a screed about Goldman Sachs which is, as far as I can tell irrelevant (Goldman do very little retail banking; their software development will be quite different to that done for retail banking), and then some description of how the author thinks (all?) large companies are (mis)run. I don’t know if Goldman was meant to be a prototype for this model of company management but it seems like a particularly strange example (in particular, they still will have some remnants from the culture of being a partnership, so they’ll be run somewhat differently from other big investment banks).<p>I found the second half did not ring true. I’m sure software projects fail at big companies (including retail banks, Goldman Sachs, other investment banks, tech companies, and so on) but I don’t find the reasons given in the article convincing to the extent that I think that section could have been written by someone who had only ever worked at very small companies. But maybe it’s just me and most companies are so obviously terribly wrong in these ways that no one even bothers to write about them and so I only see subtle ways they go wrong like projects dying off due to management acting in bad-faith ways or rewarding people for things that aren’t actually so good for the company or whatever.<p>If you’re interested in better discourse around certain kinds of bureaucracy, look into <i>moral mazes</i>.<p>[1] generally ‘I could do that in a weekend’ is code for ‘I could do some minimum thing that doesn’t actually solve whatever the important problems are in a weekend’</div><br/><div id="36387868" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36387868" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">angarg12</span><span>|</span><a href="#36382094">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36386429">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36387868">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36387868">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The second part of the article makes it clear that the author has never worked in online banking (I have), and possibly any other complex domain.<p>&gt; Have you ever heard about those three web engineers who figured out that secure online banking is actually quite an easy problem to solve?<p>&gt; The storage and transfer of numbers is not a particularly hard problem.<p>These quotes are so incredibly disingenuous that make me question any advice OP has to offer.<p>First, banking is quite a complex domain, and it&#x27;s complexity increases exponentially with the kind of services that you offer.<p>Second, banking is a highly regulated industry, which makes everything why harder than &quot;it should&quot;. In fact many &quot;neobanks&quot; have appeared in the last decade, and this is usually their biggest hurdle.<p>Third, online banking needs to deal with quite a few hard technical challenges.

People just love building things even when they&#x27;re not needed. After a while, your ego gets attached to whatever it is you&#x27;ve built and you can&#x27;t let it go.<p>I remember working at one place where somebody built a new framework to solve a common problem we all had. He pitched it to all the other devs in a meeting and I remember being confused about it because there was a standard framework that solved the problem already and did it in much simpler and more elegant way. (To be fair to him, this standard functionality was only recently introduced.)<p>During his presentation, I asked why the standard solution wouldn&#x27;t work for him. It turns out he wasn&#x27;t familiar with it. Fair enough, so later I messaged him and showed him the standard way to do it and how much simpler it was. He couldn&#x27;t be swayed.<p>He just couldn&#x27;t accept that his complicated solution wasn&#x27;t necessary. He constructed scenarios where his idea was needed, even though I saw solutions to those scenarios using the standard framework.<p>Interestingly enough, one of the scenarios where his custom thing was needed was in some tests he had written where he did some complicated things to set things up. I looked at the tests and even there saw those complicated things weren&#x27;t necessary! There were ways to simplify what he was doing so that the tests were better written <i>and</i> didn&#x27;t need his custom tool.<p>Anyway, he wouldn&#x27;t be convinced. And because he couldn&#x27;t be convinced, we got stuck with his solution and saw people continue to work on it, add more functionality to it, fix bugs, etc. All of that work was just a waste of time when we could&#x27;ve relied on a standard solution, which was way more mature and way simpler.<p>All of this drove me crazy, but I realized that sometimes people are just unable to see simple solutions to problems. Worse, having one complex solution begets more complex solutions elsewhere.</div><br/><div id="36383011" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36383011" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manmal</span><span>|</span><a href="#36381942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36382048">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36383011">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36383011">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; people are just unable to see simple solutions to problems<p>This person might just have been terrified of admitting that all the (very tangible) time they spent on payroll building this thing was for naught.

Does it mean you should never optimize? No. Does it mean you should always optimize as a last step? Also no.<p>Here&#x27;s the full quote:
&quot;Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s way more nuanced and basically says: &quot;Stop wasting time on optimizations with little gain, but still do them where they are useful&#x2F;necessary.&quot;<p>Right now I&#x27;m working on an embedded device running a small Linux. Our resource usage is well within the bounds, so thinking about better architectures or optimizations is an imaginary problem. Right? No. Not at all. Making our software smaller and&#x2F;or faster doesn&#x27;t only mean we can put on more software, it also means we could produce cheaper because we need less resources.<p>Thinking about and experimenting with different architectures or newer technologies also seems like imaginary problem solving at first, but there is a good possibility that you improve your system as well. A better architecture could make your software more maintainable or give you the flexibility to implement new features in a way, that was really cumbersome with the old code.<p>So while I agree with the sentiment that you should not implement things you don&#x27;t need, I also think that there should be room for people to experiment and try out different things. Because sometimes, the people working with the code the longest are blind to it&#x27;s many shortcomings. Because it&#x27;s normal for them to just work around them. But getting rid of those shortcomings can save you hundreds of man hours of work in the long run.<p>To cut a long story short: Do experiment. Do think about problems you might have in the future. Do the mental exercise and think about how to improve your current code and architecture. <i>But don&#x27;t blindly implement it</i><p>Always evaluate what your trying to do. Check if it improves the things it&#x27;s supposed to improve and also check if it doesn&#x27;t make matters worse elsewhere. Get to know the tradeoffs and make informed decisions if changing something that works to something that&#x27;s better is worth it to you.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36382081" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36382081" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vbezhenar</span><span>|</span><a href="#36388336">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36380909">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36382081">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36382081">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How do you manage boring part though?

Management, sales, HR, support, legal, and even accounting departments have their own unique ways of creating imaginary problems.

They overemphasize a minute problem that is related to their role, or hire teams much larger than necessary to illustrate their importance.<p>I run into this more often than problems I imagine.   A whole series of what ifs and folks imagining things.

We can make it easier for sure, but if you have 20 rules with different weighted priorities:<p>1. It is complex for most people to think of.  It will look complex because it is complex.<p>2.

I&#x27;ve seen extra shit get built, but I&#x27;ve also seen e.g. a travel booking system that was built without a &quot;flight&quot; being a first class entity. Flights were deduced on the front end from attributes attached to seats... which worked well until a PM asked for the UI to show fully-booked flights, which HAVE no available seats that make it to the front end. Same product couldn&#x27;t handle the booker and traveler being different people, when they knew from day 1 that it would be a necessary feature. It would have been little extra work to incorporate into the data model from the beginning, even if the two values were always the same for a while.<p>I think the majority of the technical debt I&#x27;ve seen that isn&#x27;t ci&#x2F;cd related is disconnect between the domain model the product team is working in and the data model the engineering team is working with. Formalizing that domain model is now one of the first things I do when joining a team, so everyone agrees on precisely what the major nouns and verbs are and how they interact. Not just for the current system, for where we think we will be in 2-3 years. With everyone doing agile, it&#x27;s amazing how many incompatible, un-written assumptions you discover that hadn&#x27;t been ironed out.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

There&#x27;s a lot to dislike about Apple and I won&#x27;t go into it, but as an example, I like their support policy. They promise 5y and usually it&#x27;s 7y. They do disable features on older phones via feature flags where the performance would not be up to it (like on-device AI lately), but this rather long support does not seem to impact their sales negatively. Arguably it works for them b&#x2F;c people know they can resell their phones after 2y and still get a good price as buyers know they will get support. I am one who switched from Android&#x2F;Sony precisely because of this.<p>The same could be true for opening older phones as some Android makers do unlocking the boot loader and leave it to enthusiasts to port newer Android versions.

Your door opener isn&#x27;t connected to the internet, it&#x27;s connected to your router, which uses network address translation to make all your devices share a single internet connection.  So your door opener can send outgoing messages no problem, and the NAT router will route those outside, and then route responses to those messages back to the opener, but there&#x27;s no (easy) way for a device outside your home network to access your opener.  Of course, your phone or PC <i>is</i> on your home network, but only when you&#x27;re at home.  Presumably, you also want to be able to control your door opener when you&#x27;re <i>not</i> at home, and at those times, you have to get through the NAT.  Doing that requires the company&#x27;s server, or something like Tailscale which sets up a virtual private network (VPN) between your opener and selected devices.

They are very affordable and use an open source OS on what I think is an ESP32 enabling Bluetooth and WiFi. They have an IoT cloud thing paired with their app BUT you can disable their cloud or use your own cloud URL, enable RPC over http or UDP and write your own code, use MQTT, local web server in the switch, etc. The outlets are just relays though they measure load current and voltage. Bonus is they do not need to be commissioned through an app - you can do everything over a browser or http calls via curl so you can use whatever OS and even script it.<p>My only gripe is the wall switches do not have any ability to accommodate retrofitting a 3&#x2F;4-way setup which is quite common for stairwell and hallway lighting.<p>Edit: here&#x27;s the dimmer API for reference <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud&#x2F;gen2&#x2F;Devices&#x2F;Gen2&#x2F;ShellyPlusWallDimmer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud&#x2F;gen2&#x2F;Devices&#x2F;Gen2&#x2F;Shell...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41493666" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41493666" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajsnigrutin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41493511">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41493848">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41496864">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41493666">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41493666">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just look at the ones that support Tasmota (or ESPhome).<p>Those use opensource software, integrate nicely into home assistant, and well.. are &quot;local first&quot;.</div><br/><div id="41493752" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41493752" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">simcop2387</span><span>|</span><a href="#41493511">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41493666">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41496864">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41493752">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41493752">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For lights and relays (haven&#x27;t bought the others yet) i;ve been really hapoy with the quality of athom devices.

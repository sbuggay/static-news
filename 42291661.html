Code is my infinite playground but others won’t touch it - despite me trying to convince them for years. They would rather work in the sun, or with other people, or in a busy environment.<p>People filter themselves into jobs they would rather do, when they have awareness of the possibilities. With social media that awareness is increasing.<p>I’ve had friends who had the definition of blue collar standing job and chose to transition to nursing, which is another standing job.<p>Immigration status and lack of language skills may tie you to standing jobs, but if people want to learn and grow out of them, in the US there are pathways. If someone curates a course on career pathways via youtube and spreads them through immigration centers and schools and social programs that will help even more people find their way.<p>I find healthcare workers to be an interesting mix in this discussion. Their work is extremely physical and mental, and emotionally draining. Demand for it will only go up. Compensation for it will likely go up. Who picks up the jobs will be enlightening. Yes you have the bottleneck for doctor and nurse training, but CNA and PA are not as limited. Doctor liability is an extreme source of stress, but that somehow  doesn’t apply to nurses as much, so even doctors recommend their kids become nurses.</div><br/><div id="42326238" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42326238" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">emptiestplace</span><span>|</span><a href="#42325009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325123">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42326238">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42326238">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Physical activity is integral to optimal cognitive function and mental performance.

It is interesting that you think bookkeepers (accountants?) do little problem solving.

I live in Austin and have a major axe to grind about the public libraries here, which are nothing like what you&#x27;d get if you were actually interested in the pro-social goals that you&#x27;d think a public library would have in its charter.  A teenager looking to escape their high-risk environment or an adult who&#x27;s had their feet knocked out from beneath them basically stands no chance at getting out of their predicament if their only option were to use the public libraries here, which would unfortunately act more like a vortex to ensure they stay in the suck.

(That is not to say that it&#x27;s a simple one, or that naive economics trivially applies here or will necessarily give correct answers, or <i>especially</i> that either the supply or demand are straightforward to change, just that it&#x27;s a reasonable reasoning framework to start with.) The more people willing to do a job, the lower the standards of the lowest bidder. Solving this problem requires one or more of:<p>1) Raising the minimum standards of the lowest bidders on the worker side. This could be done through collective bargaining or regulation, making it so nobody is willing to &quot;defect&quot; (in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma sense) and work for conditions below a certain standard, which means there&#x27;s little to no supply of such workers.<p>2) Raising the standards on the demand side. This could theoretically happen if consumers are willing to preferentially purchase from places that provide higher standards for workers; effectively, coordinate and collectively bargain on the purchasing side. This seems unlikely to happen as consumers are even more likely to &quot;defect&quot; and purchase from the least expensive company. This is one case where a simplistic model breaks down: consumers&#x27; ability to collectively demand higher standards for how companies treat their workers is limited by the fact that consumers are getting their income and ability to afford higher standards <i>from</i> the work they&#x27;re doing.<p>3) Lowering the supply of labor across the board. This would happen if fewer people are willing to do the job, such as if people didn&#x27;t have to work in order to survive (e.g. UBI). If there isn&#x27;t an endless supply of workers who <i>have</i> to tolerate whatever conditions get them paid enough to survive, satisfying demand for labor requires substantially higher standards for pay and working conditions. (Conversely, if everyone in a workplace <i>wants</i> to be there, it&#x27;s easier to get quality <i>output</i>.)<p>4) Raising the demand for labor across the board. This isn&#x27;t going to happen, as it&#x27;d run counter to some of the primary defining qualities of an improving society; even if it did, it would be likely to ultimately result in similar stratification between groups of workers.<p>5) Raise the mobility from one category of labor to another. Constantly being worked on in many different ways, but will inherently never be able to fully solve the problem because not enough people can take advantage of this option to avoid stratification.<p>The feasible alternatives here feed back both positively and negatively into each other.<p>Personally, I think implementing (3) via UBI is the one most likely in terms of feasibility. (Not <i>politically</i> in terms of passing it, but <i>practically</i> in terms of how monumentally effective it would be compared to the rest.) (3) is the option here most immune to the prisoners&#x27; dilemma defection problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42323819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jp0d</span><span>|</span><a href="#42323449">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323161">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is really well done and was eye opening for me as I&#x27;m predominantly a sitter.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42323161" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323161" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oceanparkway</span><span>|</span><a href="#42323819">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325853">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323161">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323161">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The presentation of data was nice (slides with a constant format) and the measured amount of labeling was great</div><br/></div></div><div id="42325853" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42325853" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unnouinceput</span><span>|</span><a href="#42323161">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323160">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42325853">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42325853">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Quote: &quot;America got rich selling cotton picked by enslaved Black people&quot;<p>I stopped there.

Significant savings or investment are rare outside of a property.<p>It’s just money on the other side of the equation, government and socialised vs independent and free to use or not.<p>At the very bottom it’s not like it matters in either case, you might have time off but no money to do anything with it.</div><br/><div id="42325126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42325126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">diputsmonro</span><span>|</span><a href="#42323767">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42325126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42325126">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple, for at least two reasons I can immediately think of:<p>1) Several Americans live paycheck to paycheck with no significant savings outside of property either.  One unexpected emergency is enough to empty the savings of most Americans [1](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;one-emergency-away-study-shows-221950532.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;one-emergency-away-study-shows-22...</a>).  The idea that Americans make more money and that makes up for the difference just doesn&#x27;t play out in reality for all but the richest and luckiest.<p>2) Taking a 30 day vacation and coming back to the same job without any threat of repercussion is much more valuable than simply 30 days worth of saved wages.  The average American worker can&#x27;t just take 30 days off, even as leave without pay, and expect to come back to the same job.  If they want a 30 day period with no work, the vast majority of American workers will have to quit their current job and then hope to be able to find a new one later - which certainly isn&#x27;t a given if you&#x27;re working unskilled jobs to begin with.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42323821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42323821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rhmw2b</span><span>|</span><a href="#42323767">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42324833">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323799">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42323821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42323821">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It depends on the job.

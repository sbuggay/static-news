We ran it _every month_ (except for the pandemic). This year (2024), I stopped doing it.<p>I share a lot of comments here. Especially the effort, which is not seen&#x2F;appreciated. What I don&#x27;t share is the trouble finding sponsors. Local (tech) companies are often happy to sponsor a room, food, and drinks for the evening. In exchange, they get a slide in the intro speech and the opportunity to present themselves. Recruiters are not welcome. This worked pretty well. If you want this, this is a different question.<p>However, I summed up my learnings from organizing over 90 meetups in two blog posts:<p>* Lessons learned from running a local tech meetup for 11 years (Sunday 14 January 2024) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andygrunwald.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lessons-learned-from-running-a-local-tech-meetup-for-11-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andygrunwald.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lessons-learned-from-running-a...</a><p>* Lessons learned from running a local meetup (Tuesday 25 October 2016) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andygrunwald.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lesson-learned-from-running-a-local-meetup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andygrunwald.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;lesson-learned-from-running-a-...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40558466" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40558466" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rexreed</span><span>|</span><a href="#40560598">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559032">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40558466">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40558466">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some of my own experience: Meetup.com is an awful platform that now has a value-extraction owner who will just make it even worse, as bad as it is now. Don&#x27;t use Meetup.com. Second, being a meetup organizer is a thankless task. People have no idea how much work goes into the operation, and this article helps show all of that. But after all the work is done, there&#x27;s no glory for the organizer. There&#x27;s no loyalty or appreciation, so if you disappear tomorrow, people will just go somewhere else, and few months later forget you even existed.<p>After running meetups for many years, even big ones, I realized it&#x27;s not worth it, and I&#x27;ll never do it again. The same goes for big events, such as conferences, etc. It takes even more work to run and organize those, not to mention the cost, and there&#x27;s simply very little juice to squeeze.</div><br/><div id="40559484" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40559484" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yyggvbb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558466">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40559484">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40559484">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Before you read the rest of the comments, this guy has a competing product to Meetup.com he’s selling us today.</div><br/><div id="40560579" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560579" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">keithalewis</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558466">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558496">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560579">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560579">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Could you do us a favor and give us a link to his product?

So large that the pizza bill was way more than the host (who was the sponsor as well) had anticipated, so we were no longer welcome at that venue. And said host is a well known billion dollar Aussie company.<p>Thankfully for GolangSyd, my cohosts have been extremely talented with finding sponsors.

I realized at that moment that I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to.<p>I don&#x27;t like the business part of technology, I&#x27;d rather have a meet up of twenty people building cool random things with Python, than two hundred job-seeing networkers. I know it&#x27;s a bit of a false dichotomy, but I&#x27;ve found that sponsors turn the event businessy quickly.<p>This is all to say that, if you&#x27;re organizing a meet up, you should decide what you want from it. I don&#x27;t want a large meet up, I want a small group of people who know each other and have fun while presenting topics interesting to them. Maybe you want the biggest meetup in the country, with everyone there finding exciting jobs.

However, that does mean more time scoping out the capacity at the general time of the meeting. Going there 8am is irrelevant when the meetups at 7pm.<p>The atmosphere and ambience is important as well. A venue with insane echo is atrocious, or one a bit too busy.

You&#x27;ll never find a time that works for everyone, so just pick one that works for the core participants.<p>I was heavily involved in running several meetings for ~20 years, and we&#x27;d regularly have 30-50 people at them.<p>We got space from, at various times: Businesses, Universities, NIST, Hackerspaces.  Check around, it can be pretty tough to find space, especially for larger meetings and meetings that need projectors for presentations, but we always were able to find a place.</div><br/><div id="40560142" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40560142" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">genuine_smiles</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558288">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558636">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40560142">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40560142">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; they absolutely will not let you sign up for a room monthl<p>Ours seems to</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40558636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40558636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">solraph</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558288">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40559479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40558636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40558636">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve run various meetups in the past, some of which have been successful, some not.<p>The biggest thing I learned was that you if you start it, you have to drive it. If you take a few months off, don&#x27;t expect anyone else to pick it up and run with it, even if they offer and you give them the keys to do so.<p>Nowadays I don&#x27;t have time for anything too involved. Instead of meetup.com, I &quot;run&quot; a small private group (which is me with a mailing list and a google calendar invite) of remote IT workers in Inner North Melbourne (AU) who catch up for beers once a month (email in my profile for details) It&#x27;s surprisingly better in some ways. The group is tighter, and there&#x27;s far less stress.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40559479" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40559479" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aag</span><span>|</span><a href="#40558636">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40558075">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40559479">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40559479">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve run the Bay Area Lisp and Scheme meetings for a few years.

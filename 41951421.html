I know some models you can tweak the weights, without the source data, but it does seem like you are more restricted without the actual dataset.<p>Personally, the data seems to be part of the source to me, in this case. I mean, the code is derived from the data itself, the weights are the artifact of training. If anything, they should provide the data, the training methodology, the model architecture, the code to train and infer, and the weights could be optional. I mean, the weights basically are equivalent to a built artifact, like the compiled software.<p>And that means commercially, people would pay for the cost of training. I might not have the resources to &quot;compile&quot; it myself, aka, run the training, so maybe I pay a subscription to a service that did.</div><br/><div id="41951945" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41951945" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lolinder</span><span>|</span><a href="#41951587">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41951918">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41951945">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41951945">[32 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of people get hung up on `weights = compiled-artifact` because both are binary representations, but there are major limitations to this comparison.<p>When we&#x27;re dealing with source code, the cost of getting from source -&gt; binary is minimal. The entire Linux kernel builds in two hours on one modest machine. Since it&#x27;s cheap to compile and the source code is itself legible, the source code is the preferred form for making modifications.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work when we try to apply the same reasoning to `training data -&gt; weights`. &quot;Compilation&quot; in this world costs hundreds of millions of dollars <i>per compilation run</i>. Cost of &quot;compilation&quot; alone means that the preferred form for making modifications can&#x27;t possibly be the training data, even for the company that built the thing in the first place. As for the data itself, it&#x27;s a far cry from source code—we&#x27;re talking tens of terrabytes of data at a minimum, which is likewise infeasible to work with on a regular basis. The weights <i>must</i> be the preferred form for making modifications for simple logistics reasons.<p>Importantly, the weights are the preferred form for modifications <i>even</i> for the companies that built them.<p>I think a far more reasonable analogy, to the extent that any are reasonable, is that the training data is all the stuff that the developers of the FOSS software ever learned, and the thousands of computer-hours spent on training are the thousands of man-hours spent coding. The entire point of FOSS is for a few experts to do all that work <i>once</i> and then we all can share and modify the output of those years of work and millions of dollars invested as we see fit, without having to waste all that time and money doing it over again.<p>We don&#x27;t expect the authors of the Linux kernel to document their every waking thought so we could recreate the process they used to produce the kernel code... we just thank them for the kernel code and contribute to it as best we can.</div><br/><div id="41953019" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41953019" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragonwriter</span><span>|</span><a href="#41951587">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41951945">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41952175">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41953019">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41953019">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A lot of people get hung up on `weights = compiled-artifact` because both are binary representations,<p>No, that&#x27;s not why weights are object code.

In reading our thread again I realized we are probably talking past each other. Really this discussion should be about the philosophical aspect of what constitutes open source in the context of LLM’s. Which is a tough and more interesting topic.<p>Really the conversation should be reframed to be something along the lines of “is it even ethical for these companies to offer their LLM as anything other than open source”? The answer, if you look into what they do, is “probably not”. Arguing about the technicalities of whether they follow the letter of whatever rule or regulation is probably a waste of time.

But training data is not part of the preferred form for making modifications to an existing AI system. The insights and correlations in that data have already been learned.<p>This makes sense. What the OSI gets right here is that the artifact that is made open source <i>is</i> the weights. Making modifications to the weights is called fine tuning and does not require the original training data any more than making modifications to a piece of source code requires the brain of the original developer.<p>Tens of thousands of people have fine-tuned these models for as long as they&#x27;ve been around. Years ago I trained GPT-2 to produce text resembling Shakespeare. For that I needed Shakespeare, not GPT-2&#x27;s training data.<p>The training data is properly part of the development process of the open source artifact, not part of the artifact itself. Some open source companies (GitLab) make their development process fully open. Most don&#x27;t, but we don&#x27;t call IntelliJ Community closed source on the grounds that they don&#x27;t record their meetings and stream them for everyone to watch their planning process.<p>Edit: Downvotes are fine, but please at least deign to respond and engage.

I think the analogy breaks down slightly here because the memory is more like a remebered-target than something that &#x27;can be executed&#x27; like software can.<p>The vMem &#x27;memory&#x27; of what &#x27;shape&#x27; to grow-into can be altered (by adding chemicals that open or close specific gap junctions) such that any regrowth or development can target a different location in morphospace (ie grow an eye instead of epithelial tissue as in the tadpole example from Levin&#x27;s research).<p>Fascinating and I hope to have a read of the whole paper soon!</div><br/></div></div><div id="41127039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41127039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alexpopow</span><span>|</span><a href="#41127032">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41126483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41127039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41127039">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very nice perspective.

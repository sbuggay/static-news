I haven&#x27;t seen a decent paper release code in TensorFlow in years, and all the references I see to TF online are job posts from &quot;older&quot; companies (to the point that, if you are looking for a job in data science, seeing TF mentioned in the job post is kind of a red flag of a place you don&#x27;t want to be).<p>That said, I am quite certain that this has only a small impact on why Google is losing terrain, and even on why it is behind in AI (which is also debatable: narrative aside, Gemini is not that much lacking behind competitors). Certainly if TensorFlow + TPUs turned out to be better than PyTorch + GPUs they would have had a lead to start from, but if that was so important, Meta or NVIDIA would have created the first LLM, not OpenAI.<p>Simply, sometimes stuff happens, you can&#x27;t predict it all.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41264111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">websap</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264036">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264209">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264111">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Meta is the most leetcode heavy interviews for SWEs, they expect you to solve 2 leet code questions in every coding round.</div><br/><div id="41264201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fer</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264201">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unsure Meta now, but FB was indeed absurdly leetcodish 10 years back.</div><br/><div id="41264253" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264253" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mk67</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264201">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264271">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264253">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264253">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Same when I interviewed ~1-2 years ago.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41264271" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264271" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eclectic29</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263864">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264036">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264111">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264351">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264271">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264271">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Meta is less leetcode oriented?

I don&#x27;t have much thoughts on Eric Schmidt but I do know that teams work better when they&#x27;re together. It&#x27;s just more efficient.<p>There&#x27;s nothing like a team sitting together working towards a common goal. WFH can&#x27;t duplicate it.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re a dev who gets well defined specs given to you by someone who&#x27;s done the work to collaborate with others to get those specs to you, then WFH is fine. For any other role, WFH is simply worse for the business.<p>I think on HN, it&#x27;s skewed more towards pro-WFH because a lot of devs here do in fact get specs handed to them and they just work on the specs and occasionally answer&#x2F;ask questions on Slack.<p>On the other hand, nearly every other role is way worse WFH. For example, a product manager has to build relationships with other departments and teams, persuade other leaders, talk to customers (usually better in person). There are a ton of communication that needs to happen and often, it&#x27;s simply better in person than on Slack&#x2F;Zoom. Writing the spec is the &quot;easy&quot; part.<p>Where there is a disconnect between the HN dev crowd and businesses is that from the HN dev&#x27;s perspective, WFH is fine for them and it works well. They&#x27;re not losing much. But for everyone else in the business, it&#x27;s much less efficient. A business cannot let their devs WFH and everyone else must be in the office. It&#x27;s simply unfair. Therefore, businesses recalled everyone back in the office so it&#x27;s fair.<p>A HN dev is always confused about why businesses want them back in the office. They make up weird conspiracy theories like how executives own real estate so they need sabotage their own company to increase their real estate value. In reality, writing code is a unique task that can be done well at home. But every other role in the company suffers.

So China ends up driving any non-Chinese battery or solar panel manufacturer out of business.<p>If Chinese EVs were to be sold widely in the US, they would be less than half the cost of any Western-made EV and would take over the EV market.

USA rewarded Germanys aggression with the Marshal plan, rewarding aggression is great!<p>Another example, Norway didn&#x27;t want to be a part of Sweden any longer, Sweden rewarded this &quot;aggression&quot; by giving Norway independence. Everyone lived happily ever after, the end.<p>Happy endings are possible.<p>If you say that isn&#x27;t &quot;aggression&quot;, that is what people say about other separatist movements, separatists are always labeled aggressive and combative, somehow people always argue that separatists are never happy and always wants more, but evidence suggests that letting them separate actually can work and make both sides happy. So I am pretty sure that sometimes when two countries wants to unify you should let them, meaning &quot;rewarding aggression&quot; is sometimes the right play.<p>For example, if England instead of waging a war against Irish separatists let them separate I think both would be happier, but instead of doing like Sweden they punished the aggression and just caused misery for everyone.<p>Now about China you are possibly right, I just think you can&#x27;t say that you shouldn&#x27;t reward aggression in general, because often that is exactly what you should do.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41264089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41264089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">reducesuffering</span><span>|</span><a href="#41263923">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264044">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41264216">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41264089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41264089">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s actually about one major thing.

(For example, rather than directly holding a kid climbing up a ladder, let them climb it by themselves while you stand by to catch them just in case.) As a result, they develop more independence, self-confidence, and the lessons stick.<p>&quot;Every time we teach a child something, we keep him from inventing it himself. On the other hand that which we allow him to discover by himself will remain with him visibly for the rest of his life.&quot; -- Jean Piaget</div><br/><div id="42722599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42722599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">d1sxeyes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708964">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42722446">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42709884">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42722599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42722599">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Piaget is well known in teaching circles as a philosophical father of pedagogy. A (slightly) less know pedagogist is Vygotsky, who invented the term “Zone of Proximal Development”. The idea is that kids can learn from others and from experimentation if you can design activities where you take the skills they currently have, consider the skill you want them to acquire, and build steps between them that a child can succeed in. To develop this example: once a child can walk, they can learn to balance by being given a task which allows them to safely experiment with falling over and staying upright. Once they can balance, you can experiment with moving while balancing. Once they can move forward with balancing, they can learn stopping safely. Finally, they should be ready to learn how to pedal.<p>If you don’t allow them to complete all the previous steps, they may just keep failing at the next task, because they’re not yet in the “zone” to be able to acquire the next skill.<p>If a child can’t balance annd move forwards unaided, they won’t be able do the next thing (pedalling) even with help.<p>Children have different skills and capabilities and Vygotsky is not prescriptive about who needs to help, and the ZPD theory often encourages learning from peers rather than adults (parents&#x2F;teachers).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42709884" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42709884" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adamcharnock</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42722446">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42715029">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42709884">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42709884">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would love to see this approach in language learning, which I am fairly bad at.

Because people don’t actually engage with the core idea — they react to what they think it says.<p>The same thing happens in business:
- Founders get stuck in the weeds of their product without seeing the bigger market opportunity.
- Teams hyper-focus on the tech, missing the customer pain point.
- Investors hear the pitch, but miss the deeper vision driving it.<p>People miss the post for the trees.<p>Here’s the thing: breakthroughs happen when you push past surface-level reactions.
The best founders? They’re not just building products — they’re connecting dots others miss.
The best marketers? They’re not just optimizing campaigns — they’re shifting narratives.
The best investors? They’re not chasing trends — they’re seeing past the noise.<p>If you want to stand out in a noisy world, here’s the question to ask yourself:
Am I reacting to the surface? Or am I leaning in to understand what’s really being said?<p>The magic is always in the nuance. The signal is often buried in the noise. The big ideas?

I live in the Netherlands, both my kids could ride a bike at 2. Shortly after learning how to walk, many kids here get a &quot;loopfiets&quot; (walking bike) which is exactly this, a bike with no pedals (nor a chain etc) [0]. I never saw a kid that can&#x27;t ride this instantly.<p>Now, the funny thing is that most parents, when their kids are ready for a real bike, they put them on one with side-wheels (support wheels?) [1, 2]... My wife and I were looking at kids doing this and were thinking the same thing: &quot;Wait, this is unlearning the whole thing they learned about balance and steering on 2 wheels! Let&#x27;s go straight to no-support-wheels!&quot; And voila, there they were, within a couple of attempts (we ran along) they were riding around! While many kids struggle when their support wheels come off.<p>Since then we joke that we are part of the anti-support-wheel-club when we see kids steering uncomfortably on such a bike. Which is really awkward since the bike has to stay upright, the kids have to hang to one side for balance when steering. And yet, it remains the most (or at least, a very) popular way.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babyhomepage.nl&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;Loopfiets-2-jaar-768x768.jpeg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babyhomepage.nl&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;Loopf...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.s-bol.com&#x2F;qQv4Y69p8j33&#x2F;1155x1200.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.s-bol.com&#x2F;qQv4Y69p8j33&#x2F;1155x1200.jpg</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bike.nl&#x2F;loekie-booster-kinderfiets-12-inch-jongens-groen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bike.nl&#x2F;loekie-booster-kinderfiets-12-inch-jongens-g...</a></div><br/><div id="42715327" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42715327" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fortylove</span><span>|</span><a href="#42711168">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42716290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42715327">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42715327">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The &quot;walking bikes&quot; you mention are extremely common in the US as well, and are referred to as &quot;balance bikes&quot; here.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42716290" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42716290" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">efsavage</span><span>|</span><a href="#42711168">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42715327">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42711578">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42716290">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42716290">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  I never saw a kid that can&#x27;t ride this instantly.<p>As a data point, we tried this with my son, who is physically very capable if not advanced, and despite many attempts over months, it never clicked for him.

Sadly she got a bit over confident and had a bit of a spill which gave her a bleeding lip which set her back a couple of weeks but the next time she was off without assistance almost immediately.<p>A few months later she was cycling 10km around the Ile d&#x27;oleron in France!</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42703033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42703033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sudobash1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699892">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42709609">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42710309">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42703033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42703033">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember coaster brakes fondly. As an American kid, all of my bikes had them. What was great about them was that you can engage them so suddenly and forcefully that you instantly lock the rear wheel. If you did that on wet asphalt at high speed and jerk the bike just right, you could spin the bike around 180 degrees or more. It was a great day when I (accidentally) found that out. You can also do that somewhat on dry pavement, but your rear wheel is going to have a reduced lifespan.<p>I think that coaster breaks (and maybe steel frames) are better suited to kids who want to be rough with their bike. My wheels were never very true, and they would have rubbed awfully with rim breaks. (Disk breaks were unheard of on kids bikes then, and I think are still pretty rare now.) The main downside is that if you loose the chain, you loose all breaking power. That happened once to me, but thankfully there was a nice dirt ditch close at hand.</div><br/><div id="42709257" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42709257" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xerox13ster</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699892">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42703033">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42709257">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42709257">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I prayed for long stretches of dry days during the summer when I was a kid, because we had a tree-lined trail with an incline leading to a back field. The trees were such that there was little to no grass on the house side of the trail, so when it dried up nice it would become dusty and loose. My siblings and I would spend all day taking turns ripping down that trail then locking up the brakes to go sliding into the dirt patch, sending up dust clouds and competing to see who could make the biggest.<p>We kept this up into our teens (bc we were rural way outside of town and our parents were luddites about the internet so we had little else to do after playing all our video games to death) and I got to the point I could drift down the latter portion of the trail and right the bike and ride away without touching the ground. I had moved on to a regular &quot;mountain&quot; bike by my teens so I had to tighten my rear brake and true my wheel so it didn&#x27;t rub to get enough stopping force to lock out the rear wheel. At one point I was using that move as a core workout lol.

Geometry for kids bikes mainly comes down to the scale of the cranks. Small cranks are needed to lower the foot position and center of gravity enough to be &#x27;in scale&#x27; with how we tend to consider bike geometry to work, but the shorter cranks also limit the suitability to a shorter leg length, so my kids&#x27; Cleary Gecko is pretty small on my 4yo, but she&#x27;s ridden it for two years.<p>Small kids need smaller components, but it&#x27;s hard to make small components reliable and cost effective.

On early bicycles, both crank arms had standard right-hand threads. As the cyclist pedaled, the action tended to tighten one pedal and loosen the other, with the result that one pedal kept dropping off the bike. British inventor William Kemp Starley had solved a similar problem years before when the right-hand cups that housed the crank or &quot;bottom&quot; bearing on early bicycles kept coming loose. He simply reversed the thread direction on the right cup so the pedaling action kept it tight. It wasn&#x27;t long before bicycle makers realized the same solution could keep the pedals in place. Wilbur and Orville were in the vanguard of those manufacturers that offered right-hand threads on one crank arm and left-hand threads on the other.<p>That is, the Wright Brothers were early promoters of the design, but not the innovators.</div><br/><div id="42712173" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42712173" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">geocrasher</span><span>|</span><a href="#42708575">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42709428">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42710880">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42712173">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42712173">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You may be right.

A clutch is a torque control device, in the case of a car it’s more like a torque limiting device. The more you let the pedal out the more torque you allow the engine to apply to the wheels up until the point where the torque you allow exceeds the engine’s available torque at a given rpm and throttle position. So if you’re constantly letting the clutch out you’re ramping up the torque limit linearly but the engine speed and wheel speed don’t match and if the engine speed is low of course the engine can easily stall.<p>Instead what you want to do, what most people do subconsciously is let the clutch out partially until it is allowing the engine to apply some of its available torque but not all, and then pause there until the car’s speed roughly matches the engine speed, at which point the clutch will stop slipping even though you still have the pedal partially depressed, after which you should be able to rapidly raise your foot from the clutch and feel no acceleration or deceleration. For an experienced driver that pause is less than like half a second from standstill. Also technically the point at which you want to pause the clutch let out depends on a whole bunch of things like how quickly you want to pull off, how much torque the engine can provide and whether you’re on a hill etc, but we just do this intuitively with experience.<p>This is like a super over-complicated way to think about it and I would never try to teach a learner driver by first explaining this lol but the point is, you find the engagement point and hold there for a while and then release when the car is moving. This is what we all do but it helps to understand why we do it so we don’t explain things wrong.<p>I feel like people also don’t get what applying more throttle does while the clutch is slipping. All it does is raise the engine rpm, it will apply absolutely no more torque (and therefore acceleration) no matter how much you press down the throttle. While the clutch is slipping the clutch pedal controls your torque and therefore acceleration. You need some throttle though to give you some room for error and some minimum torque to work with.</div><br/><div id="42708023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nition</span><span>|</span><a href="#42707120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707870">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708023">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The funny thing is when I first started learning to drive, it seemed impossible to get right without stalling or bunny-hopping or something else going wrong.

We didn&#x27;t get onto the balance bike tip until my older kid was a little older, but my younger one started on their older sibling&#x27;s balance bike as more-or-less a toddler and was riding a bike with pedals by age 4. With basically zero frustration.<p>Watching peers of theirs who used training wheels, I&#x27;ve realized they&#x27;re a trap. The mechanics of how a bike actually steers are completely different when you put training wheels on it. Whenever a third wheel is touching the ground (something that seems to be hard to avoid while turning, from what I&#x27;ve seen) it starts to steer like a trike instead of a bicycle. So transitioning from that to riding without training wheels is doubly difficult, because you also have to un-learn the instincts and muscle memory you developed with training wheels.<p>Transitioning from a balance bike to one with pedals is much easier because the main instinct they&#x27;ll be taking from it - putting a foot on the ground when you get into trouble - remains useful. It naturally helps prevent skinned knees during the transition period.</div><br/><div id="42700082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42700082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">merlynkline</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699628">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42700082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42700082">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly this. The article has the right conclusion but invents a nonsense explanation. The truth is that bicycles counter-steer at any reasonable rolling speed - to go right, you nudge the steering to the left, which causes the bike to start falling to the right and then steer into that fall. People often find this hard to believe, even experienced riders, but it is easily tested. The problem is that training wheels turn a bicycle into a tricycle, which steers in the opposite way - to go right you steer to the right. So kids learn that and then you take the training wheels off and the first attempt to steer immediately causes a nasty fall because of steering the wrong way. I made this mistake teaching my first to ride, and she hurt herself and never really liked bikes after that. Seeing it happen, I had an epiphany (eventually) and just took the pedals off that bike for my second, who had the experience described elsewhere in this thread and loved bikes thereafter.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42699628" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42699628" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">johnmaguire</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699806">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699559">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42699628">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42699628">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hear this sentiment all the time.

I remember my parents were surprised but... maybe training wheels aren&#x27;t so bad for everyone?<p>One thing I think gets lost in the discussion of training wheels: people act like you have four wheels flat on the ground, with no opportunity to balance.

On a bike, this is mostly determined by the angle of your head tube when looking at the bike from the side (if the fork is &quot;bent&quot; from the side view, this would also contribute to the caster effect).<p>But I&#x27;ve now googled, and found a paper that says that a bike can be stable without gyroscopic or caster effects [1]. It seems like the specific mass distribution of the steerable mass (front wheel, fork, handlebars, etc) vs the rest of the frame matters, and of course all of these variables interact in complex ways. They do agree that caster plays an important role though.<p>Vehicle dynamics is notoriously tricky stuff.

Have the kid pedal the bike while providing balance for the bike to stay upright, this is the jogging part. The kid will inadvertently attempt to fall on a side so hold tight to provide balance and tell them to pedal faster. As soon as they realize that while pedaling and turning does not cause them to fall it clicks for them. Provide a little balance for the first turns.

It was the sense of security that allowed plenty of practice in advance of going without.<p>One day they just picked up their bike and started riding across the playground. Plenty of miles since then no wrecks yet.<p>We were not going for precociousness, but it was really great to get it down so young. I can ride my old coaster bike alongside when it’s dry, and we’ve done night rides.<p>We did not push any step of it, but did have the next bike available to them to see and look at and talk about.

&gt; “watching your white circles”<p>There&#x27;s an alternative philosophy that kids will learn safety by experiencing accidents. This only works for types of accident that the kid can reasonably predict. Crashing a bike seems like a perfectly good type of accident to learn from. This is my approach with my kid.

I very clearly remember when a bunch of kids around the age of six and seven learned to bike, all at the same time.  All it took was a woman&#x27;s bicycle, the old type (I should say &quot;very old&quot; type at this point. Big wheels too), easy for kids. The kids had to stand up, not sit (too big bicycle), and all it took was a <i>single</i> run with someone holding the seat, and letting go after a short while. That was it. No further training required. And that was indeed how I myself learned to bike as well, when I was a kid. Training wheels didn&#x27;t exist, and are in my opinion pointless unless you want your three year old &quot;bike&quot;.

Someone grabbing your handlebars would misalign where your body is going vs where your front wheel is going and this makes you fall.<p>EDIT: I just realized that &quot;steer with your ass&quot; is something our coach used to say when we were kids.

I&#x27;d never heard of balance bikes, and then my wife did some research when we had our first kid and found out about this.<p>We&#x27;ve now taught both of our kids to bike by starting with a balance bike, and the comparison with their friends who learned with training wheels was amazing - the balance bike kids were zooming around earlier, confidently, and with many fewer spills than the training wheel cohort.<p>Also, you can get a balance bike with a handbrake, which sets them up well for getting a bike with handbrakes instead of coaster brakes. Kids bikes in the US have to be sold with coasters but there are several manufacturers (like woom) who make it really easy to remove the coaster and have front and rear hand brakes.<p>Also also, most kids bikes in the US are too heavy: they&#x27;re tough and cheap but it makes it hard to control them. Woom and Isla and probably a few others now make aluminum frame bikes for kids that are much more appropriate weight for their sizes, though at a bit of a cost.</div><br/><div id="42703033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42703033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sudobash1</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699892">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708122">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42703033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42703033">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember coaster brakes fondly. As an American kid, all of my bikes had them. What was great about them was that you can engage them so suddenly and forcefully that you instantly lock the rear wheel. If you did that on wet asphalt at high speed and jerk the bike just right, you could spin the bike around 180 degrees or more. It was a great day when I (accidentally) found that out. You can also do that somewhat on dry pavement, but your rear wheel is going to have a reduced lifespan.<p>I think that coaster breaks (and maybe steel frames) are better suited to kids who want to be rough with their bike. My wheels were never very true, and they would have rubbed awfully with rim breaks. (Disk breaks were unheard of on kids bikes then, and I think are still pretty rare now.) The main downside is that if you loose the chain, you loose all breaking power. That happened once to me, but thankfully there was a nice dirt ditch close at hand.</div><br/><div id="42707699" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42707699" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">usefulcat</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699892">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42703033">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707203">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42707699">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42707699">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can definitely lock up the rear wheel with hand brakes.

Geometry for kids bikes mainly comes down to the scale of the cranks. Small cranks are needed to lower the foot position and center of gravity enough to be &#x27;in scale&#x27; with how we tend to consider bike geometry to work, but the shorter cranks also limit the suitability to a shorter leg length, so my kids&#x27; Cleary Gecko is pretty small on my 4yo, but she&#x27;s ridden it for two years.<p>Small kids need smaller components, but it&#x27;s hard to make small components reliable and cost effective.

A clutch is a torque control device, in the case of a car itâs more like a torque limiting device. The more you let the pedal out the more torque you allow the engine to apply to the wheels up until the point where the torque you allow exceeds the engineâs available torque at a given rpm and throttle position. So if youâre constantly letting the clutch out youâre ramping up the torque limit linearly but the engine speed and wheel speed donât match and if the engine speed is low of course the engine can easily stall.<p>Instead what you want to do, what most people do subconsciously is let the clutch out partially until it is allowing the engine to apply some of its available torque but not all, and then pause there until the carâs speed roughly matches the engine speed, at which point the clutch will stop slipping even though you still have the pedal partially depressed, after which you should be able to rapidly raise your foot from the clutch and feel no acceleration or deceleration. For an experienced driver that pause is less than like half a second from standstill. Also technically the point at which you want to pause the clutch let out depends on a whole bunch of things like how quickly you want to pull off, how much torque the engine can provide and whether youâre on a hill etc, but we just do this intuitively with experience.<p>This is like a super over-complicated way to think about it and I would never try to teach a learner driver by first explaining this lol but the point is, you find the engagement point and hold there for a while and then release when the car is moving. This is what we all do but it helps to understand why we do it so we donât explain things wrong.<p>I feel like people also donât get what applying more throttle does while the clutch is slipping. All it does is raise the engine rpm, it will apply absolutely no more torque (and therefore acceleration) no matter how much you press down the throttle. While the clutch is slipping the clutch pedal controls your torque and therefore acceleration. You need some throttle though to give you some room for error and some minimum torque to work with.</div><br/><div id="42708023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Nition</span><span>|</span><a href="#42707120">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707870">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42707998">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708023">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The funny thing is when I first started learning to drive, it seemed impossible to get right without stalling or bunny-hopping or something else going wrong.

All it took was a woman&#x27;s bicycle, the old type (I should say &quot;very old&quot; type at this point. Big wheels too), easy for kids. The kids had to stand up, not sit (too big bicycle), and all it took was a <i>single</i> run with someone holding the seat, and letting go after a short while. That was it. No further training required. And that was indeed how I myself learned to bike as well, when I was a kid.

A scooter is too hard for age 3 because it has no seat; the balance bike lets either foot instantly contact the ground no matter which way the bike is falling. Once the kid starts to coast on the balance bike, introduce a balancing scooter. That&#x27;s the ideal intermediary. It allows for longer coasting with the free squarely off the ground and on the vehicle: yet offers the psychological safety of always being able to jump off. Scooters also have brakes; the kid can learn the concept of braking. That allows them to coast the scooter down hills with confidence.  The main remaining challenge on a bike is starting and to some extent stopping.  The way you set a bicycle in motion is scooter-like. You don&#x27;t sit on it and start pedaling, but rather stand on a pedal and push off with the opposite foot.

I remember my parents were surprised but... maybe training wheels aren&#x27;t so bad for everyone?<p>One thing I think gets lost in the discussion of training wheels: people act like you have four wheels flat on the ground, with no opportunity to balance. But proper training wheels should have two or three wheels on the ground, depending on if the rider is balancing or not. In other words, the training wheels should be lifted slightly up: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twowheelingtots.com&#x2F;training-wheels-faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twowheelingtots.com&#x2F;training-wheels-faq&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="42700059" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42700059" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bityard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699628">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42700059">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42700059">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have seen kids learn to ride with training wheels.

With basically zero frustration.<p>Watching peers of theirs who used training wheels, I&#x27;ve realized they&#x27;re a trap. The mechanics of how a bike actually steers are completely different when you put training wheels on it. Whenever a third wheel is touching the ground (something that seems to be hard to avoid while turning, from what I&#x27;ve seen) it starts to steer like a trike instead of a bicycle. So transitioning from that to riding without training wheels is doubly difficult, because you also have to un-learn the instincts and muscle memory you developed with training wheels.<p>Transitioning from a balance bike to one with pedals is much easier because the main instinct they&#x27;ll be taking from it - putting a foot on the ground when you get into trouble - remains useful. It naturally helps prevent skinned knees during the transition period.</div><br/><div id="42700082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42700082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">merlynkline</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708604">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42700082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42700082">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly this. The article has the right conclusion but invents a nonsense explanation. The truth is that bicycles counter-steer at any reasonable rolling speed - to go right, you nudge the steering to the left, which causes the bike to start falling to the right and then steer into that fall. People often find this hard to believe, even experienced riders, but it is easily tested. The problem is that training wheels turn a bicycle into a tricycle, which steers in the opposite way - to go right you steer to the right. So kids learn that and then you take the training wheels off and the first attempt to steer immediately causes a nasty fall because of steering the wrong way. I made this mistake teaching my first to ride, and she hurt herself and never really liked bikes after that. Seeing it happen, I had an epiphany (eventually) and just took the pedals off that bike for my second, who had the experience described elsewhere in this thread and loved bikes thereafter.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42708604" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42708604" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pablobaz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699806">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42699559">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42708604">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42708604">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If the child had practiced on a balance bike for balance and a tricycle for pedalling it all comes together quite easily.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42699559" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42699559" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jugg1es</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708604">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42704896">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42699559">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42699559">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Training wheels and pull-up diapers are both things that make the problem worse.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42704896" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42704896" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tartoran</span><span>|</span><a href="#42699514">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42708617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42704896">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42704896">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve taught 5 kids to ride bikes this year.

Have the kid pedal the bike while providing balance for the bike to stay upright, this is the jogging part. The kid will inadvertently attempt to fall on a side so hold tight to provide balance and tell them to pedal faster. As soon as they realize that while pedaling and turning does not cause them to fall it clicks for them. Provide a little balance for the first turns.

On a bike, this is mostly determined by the angle of your head tube when looking at the bike from the side (if the fork is &quot;bent&quot; from the side view, this would also contribute to the caster effect).<p>But I&#x27;ve now googled, and found a paper that says that a bike can be stable without gyroscopic or caster effects [1]. It seems like the specific mass distribution of the steerable mass (front wheel, fork, handlebars, etc) vs the rest of the frame matters, and of course all of these variables interact in complex ways. They do agree that caster plays an important role though.<p>Vehicle dynamics is notoriously tricky stuff.

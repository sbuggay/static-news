I was skimming the spec for the script interpreter, which is something you&#x27;d expect would be focused on compactness, but it seems like it&#x27;s designed entirely around JSON semantics and concepts, which means any implementation necessarily carries along this complexity.  This isn&#x27;t to say that JSON is bad, but to put it at the absolute core of the data model seems problematic.  This problem happened with Matrix when they started having to layer JSON around base64-encoded-encrypted-JSON and generally the looseness of the format infecting the entire data model of the protocol.<p>Like the SPMessage format here too, uses JSON.stringify to indicate structure encoding, which necessarily implies that any implementation of the protocol is bringing along needing to handle JSON semantics.  JSON does not seem to be well-suited here as it doesn&#x27;t composing cleanly in the way a data structure defined in terms of bytes would.</div><br/><div id="36810955" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36810955" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">GoblinSlayer</span><span>|</span><a href="#36810417">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36808039">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36810955">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36810955">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, it&#x27;s a webapp, so everything there is designed with web technologies.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36808039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36808039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duskwuff</span><span>|</span><a href="#36810417">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36806861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36808039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36808039">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; End-to-end encrypted, federated...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shelterprotocol.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;federation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shelterprotocol.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;federation&#x2F;</a><p>&quot;Federation: Coming Soon!&quot;<p>And I&#x27;m seeing a lot of &quot;under construction&quot; and &quot;coming soon&quot; in other parts of the protocol which seem critical to functionality, to the extent that I can&#x27;t see how this protocol is even meant to fit together.</div><br/><div id="36808129" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36808129" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gslepak</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808039">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36806861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36808129">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36808129">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re right the documentation is incomplete, we are actively working on the protocol and for any sections that we feel are too much &quot;up in the air&quot; as far as details go, we have purposefully left blank so as to not mislead implementations of the protocol.<p>However, the core of the protocol is stabilizing and I can answer generally as far as missing sections go.

There are a couple options in this space. The zero-knowledge stuff likely comes from the blind salt (OPRF, Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function). There are different variants to chose from, with slightly different security &amp; performance trade-offs. This stuff indeed allows password authentication without ever revealing the password to the server, but the password database itself is still vulnerable to dictionary attacks once it’s stolen.<p>What worries me though is how they failed to mention PAKE. I’ve seen much of their talk, and to be honest it smelled like snake oil. Very shallow explanation of the protocol, and many missing steps between that and an actual use case. It’s supposed so solve many Big™ problems, but how it achieves it is very unclear to me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36809523" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809523" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gslepak</span><span>|</span><a href="#36808039">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809261">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36811467">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36806861">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809523">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809523">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of federated protocols (including partially implemented protocols, thinking @-protocol) are being released right now. There is a paradigm shift occurring in the way software development of web apps is done, and we want people to be aware of all of their choices when exploring this new way of building web applications.<p>Maybe you want to build a federated application yourself, but want certain features that some of these protocols don&#x27;t have. Well, now you know a little more about what&#x27;s possible in this design space. Perhaps you&#x27;ve already settled on a protocol (e.g. have started building on ActivityPub), but want end-to-end encryption. Well, now you&#x27;re aware that you can in fact add it in to your existing ActivityPub-based app. For example, there&#x27;s no reason why Mastodon couldn&#x27;t use Shelter Protocol to encrypt DMs between users. Shelter Protocol is very lightweight, and can be an add-on to existing apps.<p>Regarding the ZKPP, it is implemented, but like the rest of the code is not yet separated out from that repo.

This is a curiosity for how we happen to be using Shelter Protocol in Group Income (which uses Vue). Vue.js both is <i>and</i> isn&#x27;t saved to the contract. Each contract manifest has two versions of the contract: one &quot;complete&quot; contract containing all of the code necessary for reproducing the state, and one &quot;slim&quot; version that has any large dependencies passed in to the contract at runtime. Group Income uses the slim version so that the contracts load quickly, but it&#x27;s also possible for anyone to reproduce the state of a Group Income app independently, without using Group Income, by loading the &quot;full&#x2F;complete&quot; version of the contract because all necessary dependencies are bundled in.</div><br/><div id="36809877" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36809877" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Groxx</span><span>|</span><a href="#36809764">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36809855">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36806030">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36809877">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36809877">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>an append-only log that is stored in a key-value database.</i><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s definitely not clicking in my brain at the moment.

Most popular web apps today are centralised silos that don&#x27;t give you privacy from the operator, and those that aim for federation often also don&#x27;t give you much privacy either.<p>Now, it can be that those factors are not important for the specific thing you&#x27;re developing, and that&#x27;s fine. But, if they are, having an existing framework to build on top of can give you a head start (even indirectly, by showing you what works or doesn&#x27;t).<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m involved in the development of Shelter.

Crypto is just a way for enforcing certain trust relations that have already been established or agreed upon. Just like you can use crypto to help centralise power (e.g., allowing you to only run signed applications that can only show signed content), you can use crypto to help decentralise power with tools for confidentially presenting content and allowing you to vet your applications haven&#x27;t been tampered with.<p>In both cases the underlying technology has many common components, and what changes is the use you make of it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36807315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36807315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JohnFen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36806030">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36806796">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36806985">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36807288">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36807315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36807315">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t hate blockchain, but I also don&#x27;t see much use for it that isn&#x27;t better accomplished through other means.

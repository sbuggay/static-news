The percentage numbers don&#x27;t really indicate whether someone will stay in the field, it&#x27;s just a number that&#x27;s highly dependent on a lot of variables and a very bad indicator for &quot;people are staying in the field&quot;. I&#x27;m happy to be corrected, it&#x27;s just how I read this.<p>Additionally, if your assumption is that 23%&gt;20%, that would kind of mean that it&#x27;s capped at 23%, right? Once more the CS degree quota is higher than 23%, following your logic, that would be an indicator that women are more likely to leave the field because it naturally gravitates towards 23%.

You are our best Sigma 7 expert [I&#x27;d worked on the similar Sigma 5 at Transdata] and even you like the PDP-10 more. But at this point the only way we can get out of the Xerox deal is if the acceptance tests fail.&quot;<p>I took the hint, and the acceptance tests mysteriously started going haywire!<p>Eventually I failed to cover my tracks well enough, and Xerox spotted my username in a core dump.<p>Back to my manager&#x27;s office. &quot;Xerox figured out what you were doing, and we had to tell them we would fire you. So, you&#x27;re fired. But you still have your Teletype at home? And you have plenty of other work to do on the PDP-10, right? Can you work from home unofficially and keep track of your hours? Just stay away from the Sigma 7.

For the Harps, cracks were also appearing.

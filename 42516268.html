Every single one of them was an electric scooter or &quot;personal mobility device&quot; ie onewheel, hoverboard, etc. But NYFD kept calling them &quot;ebike fires&quot; and this was not a &quot;mistake&quot; (see below) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bicycleretailer.com&#x2F;industry-news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;26&#x2F;approximately-none-recent-e-bike-fires-new-york-involved-e-bike" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bicycleretailer.com&#x2F;industry-news&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;26&#x2F;app...</a><p>Third, the NYC government has a long history of hateboners for ebikes. NYPD regularly would do &quot;raids&quot; and confiscate e-bikes from delivery workers, which they could get back for several hundred dollars - a fine greater than nearly any motor vehicle infraction there is. It amounted to a city-government-run-mafia shakedown of some of the city&#x27;s poorest residents. This is just more of the same; NYFD are purposefully lumping in e-bikes with the devices actually causing fires, to push a narrative that eBikes are dangerous.</div><br/><div id="42538295" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42538295" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">relyks</span><span>|</span><a href="#42536802">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42537350">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42538295">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42538295">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is not true.

Can&#x27;t get sued for workers comp if you&#x27;re employing people through a third party company that (oops!) dissolved 6 months ago.<p>Google Books gave the Books employees very visibly different IDs and they were third-class citizens on campus, not even allowed to leave the area around the Books warehouse, if I remember right? Google won&#x27;t even pay their shuttle drivers enough; there was an article a while back where the reporter interviewed a shuttle driver who was having to live in a camper van in the Google parking lot because she couldn&#x27;t afford any housing anywhere near a reasonable drive from the Google office. I knew a massage therapist who worked at a Google office and she snorted when I asked her if she got all the fancy benefits management, engineering, and marketing get.<p>FFS the article brags about how &quot;prudent&quot; they are for their labor cost-cutting;  overseas outsourcing a lot of their labor, for example. I bet damn near every non-management position is part-time so they get out of paying any benefits.<p>This stuff is being done to deflect criticism when labor rights activists go to city hall or Albany. Grubhub et al hire lobbyist who throws some cash at legislators to get meetings with them, strolls in, shows them a nice presentation with all these pictures of smiling riders, and the legislator thinks &quot;gosh golly they&#x27;re treating these people so nicely.&quot; Ditto for public committee hearings.<p>The delivery riders and drivers don&#x27;t have the ability to trek up to Albany and even if they did, there&#x27;s no way in hell a legislator would make time to meet them.</div><br/><div id="42537175" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42537175" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">igor47</span><span>|</span><a href="#42536330">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42536916">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42537652">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42537175">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42537175">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While I sympathize with your broader point about gig worker wages, I&#x27;m a little confused about joco&#x27;s role in the situation.

Talks about the beauty of excel more with a nostalgic look. If a company can replace a SaaS subscription with a process in which some employees share an excel file, they don&#x27;t need other software at all.
Any software product (SaaS included) what try to sell is a methodology or a way to do the things, condensing the know-how of an industry; whereas an excel file most of the time means a clumsy attempt by someone to bring some order to the process.  The data dependency is something goverments should regulate, forcing easy portability.  Of course, after years of using a specific tool is natural to create a dependency, but it could be considered a tax from modern life as the author himself explains, it&#x27;s something you cannot escape from.

From the Wiki description:<p>The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit is the first book by historian and Detroit native Thomas J. Sugrue in which he examines the role race, housing, job discrimination, and capital flight played in the decline of Detroit. Sugrue argues that the decline of Detroit began long before the 1967 race riot. Sugrue argues that institutionalized and often legalized racism resulted in sharply limited opportunities for African Americans in Detroit for most of the 20th century. He also argues that the process of deindustrialization, the flight of investment and jobs from the city, began in the 1950s as employers moved to suburban areas and small towns and also introduced new labor-saving technologies.

(But I do have to drive for all of my errands.)<p>&gt; Reasonable cost of living<p>I consider AA&#x2F;Ypsi to be on the low end of medium COL. Everyday living stuff (groceries, gas) is pretty typical compared to other places around the state but housing and entertainment are higher. As an upside, there is no local income tax, only federal and state.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42920266" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42920266" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yesfitz</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42926782">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42924447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42920266">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42920266">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The CityNerd, Ray Delahanty, just published a video on this topic.

It also has some generally accessible activities in January but you need to know where to look.<p>Universities&#x2F;colleges are a pretty good source of cultural activities and other things in a town but their classes, and to a lesser degree libraries (it depends as some libraries let people just walk-in though not check-out material; others control access pretty tightly), are not really public resources.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42924663" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42924663" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">al_borland</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919906">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42927920">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42924663">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42924663">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I lived in Ann Arbor for about a decade. I’ll do my best to answer some of these.<p>* On climate change, I think the Midwest is generally pretty good, and the models show Michigan as a green zone last I looked (especially moving a bit more north). But I don’t know that I’d make this a major buying decision.<p>* I’ve always felt the idea of lake effect snow was overblown I spent several years on the west side of the state, everyone warned me about the lake effect snow, and I honestly didn’t notice a major difference vs the Detroit metro area. You will get snow, but even now it doesn’t snow like it did when I was a kid.<p>* I’m not sure what options U of M has for auditing classes, but I’m guessing there is something. You’d also have Washtenaw Community College, and Eastern Michigan University over in Ypsilanti. I took some a Unix course years ago at WCC to fill the empty time in my schedule many years ago. It was pretty painless to sign up. Ann Arbor also has a lot of classes for seniors through the rec center. And of course private business… I took a knife skills course and some cooking classes at a local place there.<p>* The Ann Arbor library system is pretty decent and has several branches. UofM has several as well. I’m not sure what public access is like for UofM, as I never tried while I was living there, but I do remember going there in high school to find a rare book I needed. I tried to pop in to the Library at Harvard recently, when I was in the area, and it didn’t seem open to the public, which is the only reason I’m questioning of UofM would give you trouble.<p>* Ann Arbor is probably the most walkable city in the area, which makes sense due to the university. Also, the freeways on all sides bound it to prevent too much sprawl. Though you will want to be adjacent to the downtown area for prime walkability. They have also been putting in some protected bike lanes if you’re into that. Some of this, and more big apartment complexes downtown have left the city feeling more congested, it doesn’t feel quite as quant as it once did, but still has some of its charm.<p>* For cost of living… for Michigan it’s high, but if you’re coming from a coast, it probably won’t feel too bad. It’s really housing that is the main expense.<p>On the topic of snow… a lot of people from Michigan become snow birds as they get older. They spend most of the year in Michigan, then head down to Florida for a couple months in the winter. My dad has been doing this for the last 5 years or so (using something like VRBO). He also recently started hiring out to take care of snow removal. Or, if you choose a condo over a house, it may not be an issue at all. Just keep parking in mind, and getting to and from the car, if you’re looking for something like that near downtown. If you haven’t lived around snow before, a good hack is to walk on the grass to avoid an icy sidewalk.<p>The temps hovering around freezing, like they are now are the worst for ice. If it would get cold and stay cold, it seems much safer. But downtown Ann Arbor usually does a pretty good job keeping things clean.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42927920" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42927920" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">reducesuffering</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42924663">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919407">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42927920">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42927920">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I built an app that I input these preferences in to find your ideal matches based on data[0]:<p>Iowa City, Lawrence Kansas, Lincoln Nebraska, Champaign Illinois, and Omaha Nebraska seem to best fit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.exoroad.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;counties?wildfireRisk=Not%2520Applicable%3BVery%2520Low%3BRelatively%2520Low%3Amed&amp;droughtRisk=%22Very+Low%22%3Amed&amp;hurricaneRisk=Not%2520Applicable%3BVery%2520Low%3BRelatively%2520Low%3Amed&amp;tornadoRisk=%22Very+Low%22%3Amed&amp;earthquakeRisk=%22Very+Low%22%3Amed&amp;annual_snowfall=0%2C0.5%3B0.5%2C5%3B5%2C20%3B20%2C40%3Aexact&amp;peoplePerSqMile=6%2C10%3Amed&amp;walk_score=40%2C100%3Amed&amp;meanRent=300%2C1900%3Amed&amp;homePrice=25000%2C500000%3Amed&amp;medianAge=23%2C40%3Amed&amp;adultsWithCollegeDegreePercent=25%2C78%3Amed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.exoroad.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;counties?wildfireRisk=Not%2520App...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42919407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42919407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ElevenLathe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42927920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42919407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42919407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You might want to look at Kalamazoo.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42919665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42919665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">filoleg</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919407">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42925140">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42919665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42919665">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have an alternative proposal to Ann Arbor for this that hits every single one of your criteria, but with a plus-minus (with a caveat, but i will elaborate on that later) regarding reasonable cost of living. That would be Seattle area.<p>I will go point by point.<p>The good:<p>* According to their own Climate Vulnerability Assessment[0], the region is fairly resilient to the impacts of the climate change.<p>* There is no lake effect snow (despite being adjacent to multiple fantastic lakes). I’ve lived there for 7 years, and the amount of snow was much less than even in places like Atlanta. The amount of rainfall is ridiculously small too (despite the stereotype), and it is usually just drizzle that doesn’t necessitate even an umbrella 99% of the time. It got nothing on typical east coast rains that just pour like hell. I was able to commute to work on motorcycle for about 90-95% days of the year. For any east coast city I’ve been to (ATL&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;DC), I don’t foresee that number being even above 50% (most of the time it would be either too cold or too hot or too rainy&#x2F;snowy&#x2F;dangerous).<p>* UW is a very popular and common option for continuing education opportunities. Had friends who would take classes there for fun outside of work, just to fill gaps in whichever topics they were curious about (typically math). Seems like there is a large population that does this, and UW is a great school.<p>* Public library system is the best I’ve experienced hands down. Free, many accessible locations, and libraries even have stuff like 3d printers and hackerspaces available for anyone’s use.<p>* Had plenty of friends who lived there with no car for years, and they have zero plans to ever buy one. Especially with the public transit lightrail having some really significant expansions completed recently (with many more nearing the completion; the lightrail to eastside is something i am personally excited for)<p>The mixed:<p>* Reasonable cost of leaving is the one plus-minus I mentioned. The minus is that it isn’t cheap. It is much cheaper than Bay Area&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;etc., but it is still a major city area. The plus is that there is no state income tax. So, in retirement, your 401k withdrawals would not get any taxes skimmed off on the state level. This point is by far the biggest potential concern I have as far as Seattle being a good suggestion for you.<p>The bad:<p>* While the weather is amazing temperature&#x2F;precipitation-wise year-round, clear skies and sun outside of summer are not that common. Grey skies for more than half of the month during winter eventually got to me.<p>Bonus points:<p>* If you are into outdoorsy stuff (skiing&#x2F;snowboarding&#x2F;hiking&#x2F;kayaking&#x2F;lake stuff), I cannot think of a better area. So many options within just a couple of hours. Hell, Discovery Park (calling it a park feels like a misnomer, because it is a massive cliffside forest, fields, and a beach) is just a 15 min drive from downtown.<p>* Flying to asian countries is much faster and cheaper than from east coast (13 hour non-stop flight to Japan from NJ vs. a 7-8hr flight from Seattle).<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seattle.gov&#x2F;documents&#x2F;departments&#x2F;opcd&#x2F;seattleplan&#x2F;seattleclimatevulnerabilityassessmentjuly2023.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seattle.gov&#x2F;documents&#x2F;departments&#x2F;opcd&#x2F;seattleplan&#x2F;s...</a></div><br/><div id="42920868" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42920868" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">psunavy03</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42921647">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42920868">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42920868">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is no state income tax . . . yet.

Afterwards I watched the city decline for a good forty years.   Around the time of Detroit&#x27;s bankruptcy it started to be reborn.<p>Dan Gilbert gets a lot of the credit because he bought Detroit real estate when no one wanted it.  Skyscrapers that had been empty for thirty years or more.  People wouldn&#x27;t consider coming downtown or moving their offices there because of the crime.  In response Gilbert formed his own police force and put cameras everywhere.  They coordinated with the Detroit force and crime plummeted downtown.<p>Then the complaints were that sure it was nice downtown but no where else.  Then projects started all over the city.  Detroit is a very large city which makes fire and policing difficult.   There are huge swaths of empty area thanks to federal funding that allowed abandoned and burned down houses to be torn down.<p>The critics will point out there is still no shortage of crime although the overall numbers are declining.  But it is relatively safe downtown, midtown where the sports teams are located.  Detroit was at one time the richest city in America, yes ahead of even New York City.  Detroit also had the best public city school system in the U.S. at one time though they are near the bottom now.  There are a lot of world class museums and architecture.  The city is being discovered and rated a top destination by dozens of publications.  I&#x27;d urge you to make a trip there and discover for yourself.<p>As for tech, Detroit is only second to Ann Arbor in the state for the number of startups and venture capitalists.  Unlike the rest of Michigan Detroit and Ann Arbor are the only cities in Michigan where entrepreneurs run the local community events.   Everywhere else in the state its run by economic development organizations that do not understand startups and hinder their forward progress.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42928171" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42928171" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scythe</span><span>|</span><a href="#42917615">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42925140">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42918064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42928171">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42928171">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is also the secular trend. Detroit&#x27;s dominance in the auto industry wasn&#x27;t an accident. Iron was mined in the Iron Range in Minnesota and shipped across the Great Lakes to Detroit. It was natural for manufacturing to occur there. Other GL cities had similar advantages, but e.g. Alabama wasn&#x27;t a realistic competitor. Coal was also shipped, mostly from the Allegheny region, west across Lake Erie.<p>Today, less iron is refined domestically, and cars are made of more aluminum and less steel. Most coking-quality coal is now mined in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. On top of that, the US shipbuilding industry has become less competitive globally, which together with the Jones Act has resulted in a significant drop in shipping on the Lakes.

It turns out that politics is not so straightforward as to reward politicians who improve their cities: instead, a politician can leverage group (ethnic, racial, whatever) differences to reward supporters with largesse designed to render them dependent on the politician, while driving out those who, by nature of their independence, could oppose the politician.

The region ranks high on safety from disasters and resource shortages so, in the long term, it and the entire great lakes will see more migration once the &quot;glamour&quot; of scurrying between air conditioned spaces wears off in the places due to become desertified or flooded.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42919292" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42919292" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">schmichael</span><span>|</span><a href="#42918407">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42928172">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42924554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42919292">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42919292">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Why spend 2-10x as much to live in one of four coastal metros<p>I think you answered your own question: it’s not (entirely) an economic decision.

I&#x27;m not saying that Detroit hasn&#x27;t made progress (it absolutely has, go visit the refurbished train station), but compared to other cities it&#x27;s still lagging.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42924643" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42924643" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">psion</span><span>|</span><a href="#42918515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42919317">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42924643">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42924643">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used to roam that city in my youth some twenty years ago.

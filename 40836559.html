It can result in an &quot;uncanny valley&quot; feeling, in which something which comes across as rather American (because it is) but has a superficial layer of Australianness layered atop. Cultural appropriation, perhaps?<p>Koala Kare isn&#x27;t the worst. The worst by far, in my opinion, is &quot;Outback Steakhouse&quot;. I remember when they first opened in Australia (in the 1990s or early 2000s???), they didn&#x27;t even bother to metricate their menu. It felt weird, ordering American style food in a putatively Australian restaurant in the western suburbs of Sydney, with a menu telling you the size of steak in ounces instead of the usual grams. And I never went back to one, until sometime last decade, I was in San Mateo, California, and I was hungry and bored, so I thought I&#x27;d give them another go. And there was absolutely nothing Australian about the place except the name and imagery. And then they serve Fosters – which is a beer few Australians actually drink any more (I remember my dad drinking it in the 1980s), and few places in Australia even sell it. In fact, I&#x27;m pretty sure there was a period when they stopped brewing and selling it in Australia altogether; apparently more recently they&#x27;ve relaunched it and you can buy it again, but I can&#x27;t remember seeing it on sale.

A group of Americans in Florida in 1988 wanted to open a restaurant, and were looking for a distinctive theme or branding. And the <i>Crocodile Dundee</i> film had been a big hit in the US a couple of years earlier, and so they decided to appropriate the stereotypes of Australia it represents as the basis of their branding.

I give it 6&#x2F;10, will probably return... eventually, some day, maybe; I can get a massive amount of onion served almost anywhere if I ask nicely.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t seem very Australian to me, unless of course I&#x27;m approaching things as if I am living in a Crocodile Dundee film from several decades ago.

Some Americans seem to think films like <i>Crocodile Dundee</i> are representative of mainstream Australian culture, when they aren’t. Films like that are taking stereotypes about the small minority of Australians who live in remote rural areas, and then exaggerating them for comic effect. The vast majority of Australians live in big metro areas, and have a rather different culture. It would be a bit like if someone saw a film about rednecks in the Ozarks and thought it was representative of the average denizen of New York or San Francisco.<p>Of course, in part it is just as much Australians’ fault for selling that kind of cringey stuff to Americans as it is Americans for lapping it up. The late Steve Irwin (of “Crocodile Hunter” fame), was likewise playing up those stereotypes in his on-screen persona.

The printer ink thing actually is, but as alluded to in the article, we’re in an age of fairly minimalist anti-trust enforcement (this is maybe _beginning_ to change; the EC has been getting more aggressive for the last couple of decades, and the US authorities finally seem to be waking up a bit, but it’s early days and from a low base). Even in an environment of robust enforcement you probably wouldn’t expect that this company would face difficulties, but the printer people might well.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40850716" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40850716" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1propionyl</span><span>|</span><a href="#40850691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40854573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40850904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40850716">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40850716">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Same with Crayola.

I’ve recently thought about how quickly Prime went to mass market. It seems like it blew up on YouTube and stores couldn’t keep it in stock.<p>Then all of the sudden, it’s sitting next to Gatorade in huge volumes at Costco.<p>I’ve never seen a product so quickly “disrupt” a long-time monopoly. It remains to be seen whether it’s a fad or if they could actually compete with Gatorade, but it seems like they could, if anyone could.<p>To be clear, I’m personally not a fan of how companies like this use marketing (especially on YouTube) targeting young — impressionable — audiences, so I’m not necessarily rooting for either one of them (Gatorade is horribly unhealthy).

It would suffice to say that after many hard reality checks I don&#x27;t really feel like there are any browser vendors that feel like good stewards of the open web, and it seemed like a new browser that actually managed to break out would be infeasible... until Ladybird showed up. And now, I&#x27;m typing this reply in Ladybird.<p>Of course, it has a long way to go before it is going to be a good daily driver, but I truly believe this is the beginning of something great. I&#x27;ve been consistently surprised by what works, and the rate of improvement is staggering at times.<p>My question: Has anyone given any thoughts regarding the stance to take with DRM features, e.g. Widevine&#x2F;Encrypted Media Extensions? It seems like since our previous stewards of the open web didn&#x27;t care enough, now making a browser with substantial marketshare without this may be hard.

If the web was not controlled by corporations, DRM as part of the platform 100% would have simply never happened.<p>From my point of view, putting DRM into web browsers is actively bad for a couple of reasons beyond the usual arguments against DRM. The greatest asset the web platform has is that it&#x27;s a unified, open platform that anyone can participate in; Of course, DRM harms users too, but specifically DRM harms the web as a platform. You can&#x27;t simply have a &quot;full&quot; web browser that can browse the entirety of the web (as ordinary users understand it) without licensing Widevine. To date, only large corporate web browsers have ever gotten this privilege[1]; community web browsers are shit out of luck, almost certainly <i>forever</i>. Not only that, but Widevine will only officially support a small subset of the operating systems that are out there, ensuring that you can&#x27;t get a &quot;full&quot; web browsing experience on, for example, <i>any</i> BSD (at least not without manual work and violating several license agreements on the way.) Even if Ladybird bucks the trend and manages to get a Widevine license somehow, it will only be possible to make this work on Windows, Linux and macOS. Yes, I understand this covers the vast majority of users, but if you can&#x27;t see how this is extraordinarily antithetical to the open web I don&#x27;t really know what else to say. The web didn&#x27;t even <i>begin</i> on any of those platforms!<p>Of course, I seriously can&#x27;t blame Ladybird if they want to go this route. After all, in the position that Ladybird is in, pragmatism is a stance that is hard to beat. Ladybird currently doesn&#x27;t have the muscle to flex to try to influence the future of the web platform in such a way, especially not against the will of the mega-corp overlords that currently control the web platform.<p>If I had to guess, I&#x27;d guess the lack of an answer to my question is because taking the pragmatic stance on this particular issue will prove controversial, though I hope if that is the case that people continue to direct their ire towards W3C and Mozilla who pretty much immediately folded when the issue came up in the first place. In the moment when Flash and Silverlight died, there was a small sliver of hope that DRM on the web would die with it, but instead we wove DRM directly into the fabric of the web, and Mozilla, no doubt afraid to watch their marketshare dwindle even further, (which it has continued to do <i>anyways</i>, mind you,) played a huge part in that.<p>Issues like this are why there is guaranteed to be vile toxicity when something like WEI comes up. We know that there is no entity out there holding the line to protect the web platform; once one of these technologies like WEI makes it into Chrome, the era of the open web will have essentially ended. If you believe that the open web is important, then any technology that&#x27;s vaguely WEI shaped is enemy #1, and when there is no other option, people will choose violence, again and again. DRM on the web isn&#x27;t really quite as dire of a situation, but it isn&#x27;t particularly great either.<p>(One might wonder what the point of keeping DRM out of the browser is, forcing users to use separate software, making their overall experience worse... but that&#x27;s kind of the thing: Why in the fuck should these vendors and this DRM&#x27;d content, that is antithetical to the open web, get to benefit from the web platform built and used mostly by people who stand to gain nothing from it? If you want the benefit of the web platform and all it offers, you should be forced to lose the DRM. Otherwise, have fun deploying your own native software.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;widevine&#x2F;drm&#x2F;overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;widevine&#x2F;drm&#x2F;overview</a></div><br/><div id="40861828" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40861828" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dalewyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40854904">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40861744">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40863808">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40861828">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40861828">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Personally, I think life would be better if browsers just didn&#x27;t play the game at all.<p>A web browser is a user agent.

They are wrong every single time.  There is almost zero focus on rate limits but hyperfocus on user agent string or other headers.  For most sites I send no user-agent header and this works fine.  But when sites want certain headers this tells me the purpose is not &quot;protecting&quot; servers from being overloaded, it is &quot;protecting&quot; servers from web users who will not involuntarily provide commercially useful data&#x2F;information so that access to them as ad targets can be sold for profit.<p>Choice of user agent should make no difference.  The JSON I&#x27;m getting is the same regardless of what device or software I am using.  I decide what I want to do with the JSON after I retrieve it.<p>Imagining how things could be different, there could be &quot;commercial&quot; user agents that people use for accessing their bank acconts online and for other commercial transactions.  There could also be &quot;non-commercial&quot; user agents that people use to read HN.  Unfortunately, the way things are now people are using commercial browsers for non-commercial web use and exposing themselves 24&#x2F;7 to unecessary tracking and advertising.<p>Personally, I only use a commercial user agent infrequently.  I&#x27;m not doing many commercial tranasctions over the web.  Most times, I am using non-commercial user agents.

Because we <i>shouldn&#x27;t force users to make choices against their own interests</i>.<p>Here are some other examples of where we shouldn&#x27;t force users to make choices against their own interests:<p>- Users should not have to give up their rights to be able to access legally-mandated warranty services or replacement parts.<p>- Users should not be forced to accept being tracked.<p>- Users should not be forced to forfeit their right to be a part of a class action lawsuit to use a product or service.<p>Try as you might, you&#x27;re never going to convince anyone that the free market will just magically make all of the incentives align and make &quot;the right choice&quot;, these are things that ultimately have to be solved with policy. The closest thing to &quot;policy&quot; on the web is standards, and W3C put EME in the standards despite widespread outcry, and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re at where we&#x27;re at.<p>Now the thing is, we have DRM in browsers, but we still don&#x27;t have Web Environment Integrity, a complete and utter bastardization of the open web that would&#x27;ve made it cryptographically impossible for an open source browser to really meaningfully exist (since compiling it yourself would likely make it impossible for you to e.g. do banking or watch Twitch streams, since it would then fail attestation.) The reason we don&#x27;t have WEI is because it was widely rejected by the community. Not because users made a choice.<p>It&#x27;s nice to think that you can just leave it to the users to pick and they&#x27;ll always do the right thing, but at the end of the day most people don&#x27;t have time to care about DRM or WEI. Most people are not technical and just simply don&#x27;t have the capacity in their day to be concerned about things like that.

Existing BSD users presumably weren&#x27;t too interested in buying shiny new Macs to run their BSD OS on, so Apple using BSD as the core of their OS really didn&#x27;t affect them.  Moreover, existing BSD users didn&#x27;t need to interoperate with the new MacOS users.  An OS isn&#x27;t some kind of network protocol.  BSD users could work with MacOS users just like users of any other OS, using existing network protocols and other standards.<p>The poster child for the BSD&#x2F;GPL argument on the GPL side is usually Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;embracing and extending&quot; of Kerberos.  It&#x27;s a network authentication protocol, licensed with a BSD-like permissive license, and Microsoft infamously forked it, creating their own proprietary extensions.  This resulted in only non-MS users not being able to fully interoperate with MS users.<p>We do already see cases now where web developers write websites targeting Chrome-only browser extensions instead of sticking with standards.  In theory, if this happened with Ladybird, it should be possible for the original devs to simply add their own versions of these extensions, but how feasible that it I&#x27;m not sure.  Currently, there&#x27;s Chrome-only extensions which apparently haven&#x27;t been implemented by Firefox for some reason, so maybe it&#x27;s not as easy as it sounds.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40860533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40860533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freehorse</span><span>|</span><a href="#40854904">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40860121">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40862041">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40860449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40860533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40860533">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">BSD and BadApple have a very small intersection of targeted markets.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40860449" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40860449" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">riwsky</span><span>|</span><a href="#40854904">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40860121">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40860533">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40855457">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40860449">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40860449">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Darwinism, one might say.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40855457" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40855457" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eitland</span><span>|</span><a href="#40854904">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40855317">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40855435">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40855420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40855457">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40855457">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reality check:<p>1.

You, as a single person might not care about a patch you contributed, or a small utility you have written. However, not everyone thinks like you (e.g.: Me, as Fig. 1a).<p>When you put all this spectrum of views under a project, it becomes another thing to manage these expectations and what people want from the project in the end. When big shifts start to occur, people will react differently.<p>When it&#x27;s a project people love and contribute with the expectation of keeping things the way it&#x27;s, and the things change, people won&#x27;t be happy. See: Go&#x27;s opt-out by default telemetry proposal, HashiCorp&#x27;s and Docker&#x27;s license changes, Google&#x27;s persistent push to block ad-blockers, Microsoft&#x27;s breaking of VSCodium in subtle ways, etc.<p>So it&#x27;s much more than you and your code, esp. in projects like these. I think licensing them with licenses allowing rug-pulls (esp. under community itself), is a red-flag in many cases.<p>I also put the code I develop myself out there for the betterment of all, but it&#x27;s licensed with GPL, because I don&#x27;t want someone take and run away with it for &quot;betterment of themselves rather than everyone&quot;. Now, you might not agree with me, and I respect that, but that&#x27;s the terms I put on my code. As I always say. If you like it that much, reimplement it. I don&#x27;t care.<p>Conversely, I contribute to a project which allows no GPL code, because it&#x27;s designed to be both open, and be customized and closed at the same time. We put it out very openly in the beginning, because that license is a requirement for the use case we (as in ~10 countries) have, and MIT is the best one for our use case.<p>...but, Ladybird is not that. The project tries to build an important, foundational commodity item.

That feels to me a bit like missing the point.<p>I think for a lot of us on the older end, we lived through the era of Microsoft Internet Explorer dominating the web and that experience informs our thinking. As long as there was competition between MSIE and Netscape, with each one trying to outdo the other, both browsers kept getting better and the web kept becoming a more and more capable platform. But quite soon after Netscape crumbled and stopped being a serious competitor, MSIE stagnated: development didn&#x27;t just slow but halted for half a decade. The web stagnated, too, and Microsoft&#x27;s dominance meant that a lot of what did get built was locked in to their platform. (Partly things like CSS quirks and nonstandard rendering behaviors, and just plain neglect of new possibilities in HTML, JS, and CSS. But more than that: how many companies built ActiveX controls in that era, which mostly required Windows to function? The entire internet infrastructure of South Korea got locked in to ActiveX by law from about 1999 to 2020.) So imagining an era of Chrome monoculture brings back some pretty negative memories.<p>I don&#x27;t expect that Google would make the exact same mistakes that Microsoft made. But it would be awfully hard for them not to shape browser design around their own corporate interests if there were no competition driving innovation and no disincentive to shaping the entire future of the web platform in Google-friendly ways. I know that&#x27;s not &quot;things that have actually happened&quot;, but the whole point is that things change once an effective monopoly is achieved.</div><br/><div id="40860935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40860935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spencerchubb</span><span>|</span><a href="#40859068">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40859537">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40859473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40860935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40860935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Chrome has been #1 since 2013 and reached peak dominance around 2018.

We don&#x27;t need 78 new animation primitives.

outside of the browser. Language should be as simple as possible.<p>- Get rid of all semantic html junk.

A few people have tried some things relating to this, including myself. One thing I had done is that, documents cannot contain scripts to be executed nor can they link to scripts to be executed as a part of the document; executable code can only be linked to from the conversion file (which does other things too, and is not only for executing programs; e.g. to specify how to transform a URL to download a file in a different format), and the user must explicitly tell it to execute; furthermore, it uses uxn and not JavaScript nor WebAssembly (since uxn is much simpler to implement); and, if the conversion file is implemented at all (for simplicity, it is not required), it is mandatory that the end user must be allowed to override it and specify their own conversion file instead (therefore, the end user decides what the client software does). Furthermore, I had also decided to use binary formats, to make them less complicated to parse special cases (to avoid needing so many escaping and stuff like that, which is necessary with HTML). And then, TLS is allowed but is optional; it does not have mandatory TLS (although it is recommended that servers and clients will accept both TLS and non-TLS connections; but a client or server that does not support TLS will still work even if the other does support TLS, if both TLS and non-TLS are implemented).

Whether that means you want to display it on the screen, with your own formatting, or use a braille display, or text to speech, or whatever else it might be, you can use it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40859601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40859601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmisavage</span><span>|</span><a href="#40859473">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40860293">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40859525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40859601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40859601">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We had this with plugins and it was a security, performance, and compatibility nightmare.<p>It wasn’t that long ago you needed QuickTime and RealPlayer for videos.

Contrast that with today: you are constantly using websites which require giant libraries that entirely subvert the underlying semantics, such as React... it isn&#x27;t at all crazy to just stop adding more BS to the browser and require more of it to end up in rendering layers such as React, or even to long for a web where React is merely built on top of something like canvas. (FWIW, Flutter is like this, and it is actually pretty damned good; it isn&#x27;t <i>great</i>, but if we concentrated on only adding features required to fix Flutter&#x27;s complaints, the web would be better for it, and we&#x27;d see a ton of web browsers as a handful of people can legitimately build an operating system kernel or a language compiler or a virtual machine monitor or a CPU emulator or a 3D engine, and yet implementing all of the current web stack requires some giant company, which is ridiculous.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="40859714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40859714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">szastamasta</span><span>|</span><a href="#40859473">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40859601">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40859744">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40859525">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40859714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40859714">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We needed them because platform was too high level, not because we had not enough web APIs.

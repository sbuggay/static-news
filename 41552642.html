These are certificates that a company purchases to show it is buying renewable energy-generated electricity to match a portion of its electricity consumption – the catch, though, is that the renewable energy in question doesn’t need to be consumed by a company’s facilities. Rather, the site of production can be anywhere from one town over to an ocean away.

The &quot;doesn&#x27;t need to be consumed by a company&#x27;s facilities&quot; part makes it sound like you can buy these credits without actually using them(?), but the &quot;site of production&quot; part makes it sound like you&#x27;re buying credits and cashing them in, just not in the same location as your data center. So I&#x27;m not sure if the situation here is that you have a data center in Seattle, but you&#x27;re buying solar power generated in Kansas City, and you may or may not have a corporate office or something in Kansas City to use it.</div><br/><div id="41554041" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41554041" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pjc50</span><span>|</span><a href="#41553462">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41553573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41554041">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41554041">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some people refer to these as &quot;indulgences&quot;, like the certification of having your sins forgiven that the Catholic Church used to sell before Martin Luther (and half of western Europe) got mad about it.<p>The effect is to either shift the attribution of emissions to some other company who doesn&#x27;t care, or to cause renewables to be double-counted.<p>Consider a toy grid, with two users A and B and generators C(lean) and D(irty).

Some one brought up that it might not look good that we fly to frequently, or at all. That&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s also a very visible and easy to understand thing to focus on. One engineer does some quick napkin math and suggests that we optimize our code instead, as that would save more CO2 yearly, compared to us not flying. To me that&#x27;s a really good indication of something that&#x27;s wrong in the industry, we&#x27;re not optimizing our code anymore, we&#x27;re barely able to get rid of rarely used code and infrastructure, because keeping it running isn&#x27;t really that expensive anymore.<p>Again, data centers shouldn&#x27;t lie about emissions, but what difference would it make it they didn&#x27;t? We&#x27;re the ones buying the capacity, rather than moving to on-device computing, rather than an always running cloud.

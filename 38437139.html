It&#x27;s actually from 12th century, which is of course very close to the viking age. It&#x27;s also when Snorri was writing down the oral stories of the vikings.<p>Then they even push the use of the word in old english back as far as the 10th century. So this article first tries to say the word is modern, and then reveals it&#x27;s not.</div><br/><div id="38456691" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456691" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">progre</span><span>|</span><a href="#38456396">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38457001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456691">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456691">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree, the story is pretty long winded, but they are not wrong: Vikings never referred to themselves as vikings, nor did anyone else at the time. The word is old Norse of course but as far as I know was not used by Snorri. 
My understanding is that it was almost a derogatory term. 
They are also correct in that modern usage of the word started with the national romantics of the 19:th century.<p>So the word itself is a (almost) modern invention or at least re-purposing. Does not matter. We need words for things.</div><br/><div id="38456861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38456861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">teytra</span><span>|</span><a href="#38456396">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456691">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38457001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38456861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38456861">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Snorri uses it in several sagas (given time I might look it up, but not now).<p>In the christian middle ages it could be used as a translation for the word for pirat.

I was definitely under an insane amount of chronic stress due to the pandemic and isolation when the issues started, but after isolation ended and my life should have been less stressful the issues persisted. Some doctors seemed to take this gut-brain connection thing to mean that it was all in my head since they couldn&#x27;t find anything medically wrong with me. That was incredibly frustrating because I was experiencing real physical issues like weight loss, hair loss, bloating, indigestion, etc. But all of the tests and biopsies they did came back normal. With functional medicine and a lot of trial and error with diet and lifestyle changes I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where I feel pretty much recovered, though still with a very sensitive gut. I never discovered the root cause of my problems. My leading theories are long-covid, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or chronic stress. Possibly a combo of those things.<p>All of that being context, the thing I wonder about this is, if chronic stress does indeed inflame the gut, what does the process of reversing that inflammation look like? It doesn&#x27;t seem like you can simply remove environmental stressors to undo the inflammation. It seems that there are feedback loops and damage that occur that can take awhile to undo. When someone has a stressful life, it can be difficult just to reduce the amount of stress, much less completely redesign their life to be less stressful. And gut inflammation makes it even harder. Even if they manage to do so, say perhaps by taking a year long sabbatical if they can afford to do so, removing the stress may not be an instant solution.<p>I hope more research is done in the area of healing from gut inflammation triggered by chronic stress.</div><br/><div id="36081228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36081228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">skrebbel</span><span>|</span><a href="#36081023">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36081645">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36081228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36081228">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To pull an HN evergreen and reply to the overly specific instead of your main point: My wife developed &quot;histamine intolerance&quot; after a time of heavy stress, in a story that&#x27;s scary similar to yours. It took her years to figure it out, from chance result on a super broad blood test. To confirm this, she changed her diet to be only low-histamine foods and it made all the difference. She went from &quot;a single chocolate chip cookie makes me sick for 3 days&quot; to &quot;mostly leading a normal life, just watch what you eat&quot; in maybe half a year or so. Over time it helped her gut recover to the point that she now generally does not need to watch out much anymore, except in some periods when some old symptoms pop back up and she reverts to low-histamine diet for a while.<p>Statistically speaking this is probably not it and you considered&#x2F;tried it already, but just wanted to bring it up in the off chance that you hadn&#x27;t heard of this before.

I suggest going to a gastroenterolog, that knows about gut flora restoration. Basically you&#x27;ll get a Low-FODMAP diet for a month, then RENEW diet for ~1 year, but you will also get a bunch of special probiotics, mostly based on Bacillus Subtilis.<p>During this time the negative feedback loop is being broken, the gut will have a chance to recover and the symptoms should improve&#x2F;disappear.<p>I am slowly finishing this diet and I have to say that apart from a few ups and downs, it helped me tremendously.

As I settled in, I realized my manager, and the director, were absolutely toxic people on a powertrip.  they didn&#x27;t care if you said &quot;this is likely to bring down random hospital applications, we need to do it this other way.&quot;  2 stars on glassdoor, cowboy hats all around, staff morale not present.  they&#x27;d come up with technical ideas on how to do something, despite being barely technical people. telling them how to do, say a data migration online, because you&#x27;re an SME who&#x27;s been doing it for almost 30 years is a personal challenge, and you get crapped on, overruled, and put in your place.  Lots of downtime, lots of patients affected, yet they report literal fake status reports up the chain and generalize-away every issue to the point that the generic statement hides the issue.<p>I started getting heartburn during the day.  Then I started getting hearburn in the morning as my alarm rang. Then I started waking up 5min before the alarm rang, with heartburn, and teenager zits on my face at mid-life.  Morning was now a cup of baking soda water instead of coffee. ion pump blockers. more baking soda.<p>after 6 months, the manager ordered me to execute a migration plan that would shave off 2 days from a year-long plan.  I made a nice writeup stating we need to monitor sockets on the array a few days to make sure people aren&#x27;t actively using the data she want&#x27;s to trash.  Last time she had me do this, she asked over email, and it brought down a whole clinic that was using a share she thought was unused.  This time, I was asked not over email, but with a call from her cell phone, to my cell phone.<p>I said no problem, send me an email or type it in chat, and I&#x27;ll do it despite the high risk.  I was of course fired 5 days later, but already had a new fully remote job, which I started 5 days earlier (lol).<p>The point of the story is - the stomach issue didn&#x27;t go away.  3 years later, it&#x27;s still there.  It&#x27;s much less, but that last&#x2F;final bit, where a couple of times a year I need ion blockers for 2 weeks, and maybe one day a week I still need to start w&#x2F; baking soda water - that&#x27;s probably there to stay.  I eat very healty, lots of fiber, I&#x27;m fit. That 6 months of acidic people did damage that a middle-aged body can&#x27;t heal all the way.<p>There&#x27;s nothing you can do.

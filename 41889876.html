A user selects moderators or custom-algorithms who they find valuable. The moderation can be along different dimensions like accuracy, interest, or aligned with some political view.<p>There could a moderator whose style is to purely check the soundness of the reasoning without taking any position on the issue itself. This can lead to improved standards of discussion.<p>A key issue is how to reduce the energy required to moderate - typically a moderator evaluates the quality and rely on networks of other moderators each handling smaller domains.<p>Current discourse encourages users to sort into strongly polarized groups, whereas more nuanced feeds in social media can lead to coalitions which don&#x27;t neatly align with the standard fault lines.

The same tired memes and jokes, over and over and over, tons of low-effort comments, not much substantial, curiosity-piquing discussion.<p>Sure, maybe there are some subs that are better, but I doubt I&#x27;d be convinced to spend more time on Reddit and less on HN.  Certainly there are useful places on Reddit; I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of searching for product reviews or general customer support questions on Reddit, but that&#x27;s kinda a &quot;single purpose&quot; visit, not something for general curiosity.<p>I feel like there are some long-time HNers (your account was only created two years ago, but I&#x27;ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you&#x27;ve changed accounts or have just been a super long time lurker) feel like quality has gone down; that&#x27;s almost a meme of its own.  Hell, the HN guidelines even has a blurb about how tired it is to suggest HN is turning into Reddit.<p>But I think it&#x27;s a lot more accurate to say that quality ebbs and flows, and varies between articles and topics.

Mastodon has its dubious reputation also for child pornography.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, the mainstream internet is moderated for a reason. Being mainstream, there&#x27;s money behind it, and with money comes power - this results in moderation that is usually politically motivated, and so in recent years there has been an exodus of the masses to low-moderation platforms like Tiktok, or things like Kick for younger users.<p>When a platform or site is staffed small, such that it cannot afford to moderate, it will be suffocated by the &quot;undesirable&quot; groups I mentioned, earlier, as though they were some sort of choking algae. There are so many of these people &quot;empowered&quot; these days that, from what I have seen, it is really hard to start new social media sites without corporate resources.  Twitter is already plagued with OnlyFans bots due to being smaller now, and streaming platforms are forced to aggressively build themselves to be resilient against similar sexual content creators, who are the first people that show up. Most times these creators will be working for an organization.<p>In the end...could Twitter have existed in a non-sh*tty form in the first place? It was rapidly approaching bankruptcy when Musk was (in the end) forced to purchase it (lol). If not him, someone else would have acquired it, probably a corporation, and monetized the content to keep it afloat.<p>I think in the end, the landscape is going to look more like Tiktok (computerized moderation) for anything beyond Meta. Smaller social media platforms will be seedy and not widely populated. Forums will continue to be used by countries with their own internet ecosystems, like Korea or Nigeria or Finland, but not really exist in global lingua franca English beyond a handful of major ones like SomethingAwful.</div><br/><div id="41893135" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41893135" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41890886">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891441">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41891534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41893135">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41893135">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>It was rapidly approaching bankruptcy</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a foregone conclusion.<p>&gt; <i>when Musk was (in the end) forced to purchase it</i><p>And because it&#x27;s private now, we have no idea what its financial situation is.

Blogging is just one of the formats of how people express themselves, and while today there are many alternative formats that weren&#x27;t really an option, say, 20 years ago, you cannot replace all of blogposts with a YouTube video or a TikTok. You can replace some, sure.

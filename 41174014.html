You can replace it with a broader and probably better principle about all two-party interactions: &quot;Which one of us is more challenged right now?&quot; If you are the less challenged party, you should probably be mindful of airing your grievances.<p>And therein lies a complication: You might be dying of cancer but be a socially skilled person. And your visiting brother might be healthy as a spring baby, but as socially rude&#x2F;unskilled as ever. Who is now the more challenged part - you might be dying of cancer, but you are still better equipped socially to wrangle your brother and the situation, than he is.
  I&#x27;m not saying we should tolerate that brother, but precisely his &#x27;social cancer&#x27;&#x2F;lack of ability to handle his (social) interactions leaves him with &#x27;chronic social cancer&#x27; as well.<p>This goes too for whenever you are helping someone with solving their problem - are you helping them in a sensible way, relatively to how they are challenged

The history starts of course with Freud, but another prominent example was the theory of recovered memories in the late 1900s.<p>In this case, the ring theory was developed out of hurt because the first author felt hurt by something a colleague said. That&#x27;s not generally a good basis for a theory of how to deal with something as complicated as trauma.<p>Even the basic idea of a &quot;center&quot; is suspect. In many cases, a traumatic event is an event that affects multiple people who must interact. The classic example of trauma is warfare. Families go through trauma. Even when there isn&#x27;t a common trauma, many conversations happen between individuals who have separate but comparable traumas. You don&#x27;t want to get into a frame of mind where you have to judge and compare people&#x27;s trauma to determine what they can and can&#x27;t say.<p>On top of that there is a lot of research on kvetching and whether it&#x27;s good for patients. In most cases I&#x27;m aware of, it&#x27;s harmful to them. Most evidence-based approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), advocate the opposite of what this article is advocating. CBT says that the patient does best when they talk back to their own distorted thoughts. That means not thinking of yourself as the center of some universe, and not thinking of yourself as a &quot;why me&quot; victim that is targeted by some cosmic force. This article is saying diametrically the opposite; it says you should reinforce people&#x27;s distorted thoughts.<p>Of course, you have to be kind and gentle to someone when they&#x27;re having a hard time. But that kindness can take a lot of forms, and this article is advocating a very particular and almost ideological approach.</div><br/><div id="41177326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41177326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maxerickson</span><span>|</span><a href="#41177198">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41177290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41177326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41177326">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article proposes a heuristic for people to use when offering support to those close to them.

Yes, this includes both warfare, hopefully far from most people here, and, say, divorces.<p>This is not a universal solution. Taken too literally, or too long-term, it will harm the person(s) in the center it&#x27;s intended to protect. Yes, sometimes the only way out of pain is through, &quot;no pain, no gain&quot;. But this is a good rule-of-thumb kind of solution that helps limit the pain inflicted to the people  <i>definitely more hurt than you</i>, without any significant gain. Maybe a traumatized person, for their long-term benefit. needs to have a difficult conversation that would be extra painful due to the trauma.

Most of it seems innocuous or even helpful and a lot of it is similar in tone to this essay.<p>But what happens is the trauma-related content that rises to the top of the algorithmic leader board is the content that people engage with more. And that tends to be content that sinks people down deeper into the pain so that they seek out more trauma content to feel better. And so on in a recursive loop.<p>A lot of the content is about the value of venting, a hierarchical (and I would argue somewhat authoritarian) approach to supporting people who have been through trauma.

And, after listening, <i>and paying very close attention to cues</i>, you might find that there are conversations to be had.  They might have to do with the matter at hand, or they might be utterly unrelated but desperately needed diversion or distraction.<p>Offers of assistance are also <i>usually</i> welcome, though I&#x27;ve seen in a few places that being specific about what you&#x27;re going to offer is better.  &quot;Can I fix you a meal &#x2F; do grocery shopping &#x2F; mow the lawn &#x2F; take care of the pets&quot; is much more specific than &quot;let me know if you need anything&quot;.

The end result is like telling an obese person that they&#x27;re overweight.  Odds are exceedingly good they&#x27;re aware of the fact, and another person mentioning it serves no beneficial purpose.  At worst, such advice turns into a twisted form of blame or imposition (&quot;you wouldn&#x27;t be in this state if you&#x27;d done ...&quot;).

Baking a cake for someone who doesn&#x27;t like eating cake (or has reasons not to eat cake) is not in fact doing them a benefit.  And if the baker&#x27;s response on learning of this is to rebuke them for rejecting your &quot;gift&quot; ... well, that just clarifies that their motivation was self-serving rather than other-serving in the first place.<p>(Such responses, along with all sorts of other basically idiotic behaviour, is of course far too frequent.

Some kind of Amber Alert, to the greater metro area of millions of people.  So I disabled it.<p>And, on a local emergency alert thing, someone used it to announce a city street cleaning or routine snow removal.  I then went some trouble to opt-out of the alerts, more than it took to opt-in, like they wanted me to waive liability.<p>(Speaking of street cleaning, if only I could get the city to stop routinely driving a truck up and down the street in early morning, blaring numerous times over loudspeakers that there&#x27;s a street cleaning sometime in the next couple hours, and any cars should be moved before they are towed.  Rolling through the streets, making stern announcements on loudspeakers, to be heard inside homes, is what you do to announce that you <i>have invaded the city with tanks, and anyone caught outside will be shot</i>.  Not to repeatedly wake up a neighborhood of sleep-deprived students and researchers and hospital workers, who mostly don&#x27;t even own cars.)<p>I&#x27;d think we&#x27;re incapable of handling any real emergency, except I spent awhile listening in on local emergency services radio (police, fire, ambulance), and it&#x27;s really impressive how on the ball in an emergency some can be.  I wish some others -- who don&#x27;t seem to have that training, experience, and discipline -- wouldn&#x27;t grab the emergency alerts ball, and drop it.</div><br/><div id="41747597" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41747597" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">c22</span><span>|</span><a href="#41747371">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41747750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41747597">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41747597">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I had to disable these alerts on my devices after some similar spurious experiences.

But people around the world are not getting serious covid any more, it&#x27;s just not something anybody even thinks about more than say the flu. That&#x27;s the attenuation of the virus and natural immunity (and you might as well lump attenutation of the virus with natural immunity because they occur on the same timescale in the same interactions), which was predictable and was predicted. The UK initially followed that idea as a strategy, and Sweden followed it, it was accepted science.<p>The people who died with covid didn&#x27;t necessarily die of covid, but public health officials followed policies of lumping them together, and govts incented them to do it: &quot;more money for covid&quot;. Old and infirm people, the morbidly obese, respiratory illnesses, etc. suffered the worst, as they do from the flu. Young people were hardly affected, though young people seem to have suffered more from the vaccine side effects and the socialization developmental deficit.<p>The conferred immunity from catching covid protects you from reinfection far longer than the so-called vaccines, because these mRNA vaccines don&#x27;t work as traditional vaccines do, that&#x27;s why (along with the profit motive) we were all told to start getting boosters essentially right away.<p>When an event like this causes excess deaths, it is followed by a period with a death deficit, simply because many of people &quot;who were going to die soon anyway&quot; died early, and they aren&#x27;t around to die later, it&#x27;s accepted science. That has to have happened with covid because they told us those people were dying, but try to get your hands on the statistics. I&#x27;m not saying people didn&#x27;t get sick from covid or that it wasn&#x27;t serious, But the coverups and stonewalling stop us from getting to the truth about what happened.<p>but it is not because of vaccinations that we don&#x27;t worry about covid today, and the vaccinations we got had more side effects (in no small part because they were not tested).<p>I knew I would get downvoted for this because there is a political class that is, in HN terms, not comfortable with people &quot;being curious&quot; about it, they&#x27;d rather censor.

I think there are amber alerts (child abduction), two &quot;regular&quot; severity levels, and then &quot;presidential alerts&quot; (meant for &quot;the aliens have invaded&quot; or &quot;nukes inbound&quot;).<p>By law, presidential alerts cannot be disabled - but users can still turn the whole feature off. I&#x27;d assume that within the US, only the president or a high-ranking delegate is authorized to send these alerts, preserving the ability for these to actually work even if local authorities decide to flood people with bullshit on the lower levels.<p>Canada, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that it <i>really</i> wants people to not turn off Amber alerts (frequently sent in the middle of the night), so of course they use the code for presidential alerts to send them...<p>Part of the reason for the bad UX of these alerts is that they&#x27;re legally regulated, and the laws are, or at least were overly specific, often preventing better solutions like letting the users configure the alarm behavior (i.e. you have to turn amber alerts off if you don&#x27;t want to be woken up by them, rather than turning them into a regular notification). And since it&#x27;s a regulated topic, even the improvements that would be possible would require legal review, i.e. once the feature is &quot;good enough&quot;, few developers want to touch it and subject themselves to bureaucracy hell.<p>This system is based on cell broadcast - cell towers can send a message that will be received by all phones, without having to send it to each phone individually. The messages have channel numbers, and a set of channels are reserved for this use and most modern phones will display messages sent with those channels as alerts. That&#x27;s also why e.g. Canada can seamlessly use (and abuse) the system originally designed for the US.<p>I think severity levels are the saving grace of any overused alerting system. Swiss severe weather alerts also have severity levels, and while the default in some of the alerting apps is excessively sensitive (notifying for rain or wind that does not pose meaningful risk unless you&#x27;re out hiking), it&#x27;s very clear that you can just raise the threshold rather than opt out.</div><br/><div id="41748438" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41748438" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">red_admiral</span><span>|</span><a href="#41748190">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41748432">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41748438">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41748438">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I believe the option of sending out a presidential alert on 9&#x2F;11 was considered, but rejected because those are only supposed to be for really really really big emergencies.

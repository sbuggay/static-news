HTML captured a lot of what HyperCard offered, but web authoring tools never got as easy and still don&#x27;t offer one feature that HyperCard did--consistency of the look and feel of the UI, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, but some users liked the fact that they could create a flipbook by adding two buttons (previous, next) to a page. Some even started businesses selling educational material bundled as HyperCard stacks. The HyperTalk programming language was not great though and was one of those languages that hippies liked but the average user was as lost with it as with C or Pascal. I always had a feeling that Apple tried to control what you could do with it too much, which is the opposite of what I expect a programming language and the tooling around it to do for me.

On the Mac, the alternative to Hypercard was to layout UI widgets in code, with no GUI builder at all, or eventually to pay $$$ for a professional-grade IDE like CodeWarrior. As an entry-level user with no budget, if you wanted a GUI builder for the Mac, you got Hypercard, or nothing. This created a community of Hypercard enthusiasts.<p>Furthermore, when Hypercard launched, Macs had a standard screen resolution. Every Mac sold had a screen resolution of 512x342 pixels, so you could know for sure how your cards would look on any Mac. Supporting resizable GUIs is one of the hardest things to do in any GUI builder. (How should the buttons layout when the screen gets very small, like a phone? Or very wide, like a 16:9 monitor?) Today, Xcode uses a sophisticated constraint solver &#x2F; theorem prover to allow developers to build resizable UIs in a GUI; it works pretty well, I think, but it&#x27;s never going to be as easy to learn as &quot;drag the button onto the screen and it&#x27;s going to look <i>exactly</i> like that everywhere.&quot;<p>The last issue is the real killer for modern Hypercard wannabes: it&#x27;s a small step from a web GUI builder to raw HTML&#x2F;CSS. You don&#x27;t have to pay big bucks to have access to professional-grade HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sure, they&#x27;re not that easy to learn, but you can teach a kid to write interactive web pages, no problem.<p>As a result, the demand for a simple GUI builder is lower than it was for Hypercard, and even when you do capture a user, they tend to outgrow your product, and there are a zillion competitors, so none of them can build a community with real traction.</div><br/><div id="40295233" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295233" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msephton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40294301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295009">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40294455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295233">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295233">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; On the Mac, the alternative to Hypercard was to layout UI widgets in code, with no GUI builder at all<p>Don&#x27;t forget ResEdit, version 1.0 released December 1985.</div><br/><div id="40295307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SeanLuke</span><span>|</span><a href="#40294301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295233">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40294455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295307">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ResEdit edited the resource fork, not code, right?</div><br/><div id="40295382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msephton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40294301">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295307">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40294455">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295382">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right, but... the resource fork could contain code, as well as window definitions, graphics, icons, dialog boxes, menus, language translations, strings, and more.<p>Of course, generally you&#x27;d write source code as text and hook up your interface.

HyperCard never got a native update for it and it was the number one feature everyone wanted.<p>There was a related product (SuperCard?) that offered color. I remember trying it but it was clunky. I don&#x27;t remember why, but in any case, it never took off.<p>There was also the matter of HyperTalk&#x27;s limited API. There was a market for ... extensions, I think they were called? Some developers really dominated that space for a while. (I wonder whatever happened to J5erson? He was brilliant.)<p>Extensions were commonly written in Pascal and could add a lot of capability to HyperTalk, and were a great stepping-stone for people that wanted to explore programming beyond HyperCard.<p>Decker looks like it has a lot of the good things from HyperCard -- simplicity, portability.

How do you split the problem into smaller problems? And then in even smaller ones to the level you can express solutons in code? Then what can be abstracted for future changes?<p>I would not provide documentation, but explain how the candidate can write some code if they tell me what they want to do, perhaps write the code sketch for them.<p>The language is so simple that any candidate can get the basics in a few minutes. And I&#x27;m interested in their thinking, not in their mastery of a programming language. If you&#x27;re a good Python coder, I&#x27;d also hire you for writing Go.<p>(To understand where I came from: This is perhaps from my personal background, I have done hundreds of interviews, I wrote code in 20+ languages and was paid for in 10+ languages over the last four decades. So I value thinking and problem solving more than the correct syntax in an interview - e.g. if you write Java code, I don&#x27;t care about braces and semicolons)</div><br/><div id="40295572" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40295572" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msephton</span><span>|</span><a href="#40294390">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40295353">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40293476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40295572">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40295572">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree coding is about thinking.

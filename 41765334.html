The environmental damage of producing the device is already done. Make it last as long as possible. Reduce, <i>reuse</i>... then recycle.<p>Re-using devices helps us also <i>reduce</i> the number of new devices needed... which is what probably scares the corporate oligarchy. If we&#x27;re not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?<p>Never the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I&#x27;ve been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5&#x27;s, 7&#x27;s, and 8&#x27;s that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.<p>But tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I&#x27;ve been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted. It&#x27;s as good a time as any to push for this to return! Support policy makers that are pushing for right-to-repair and environmental protection!<p>And pick up a new hobby if you are able.

Older OnePlus phones, Sony and Google phones are being repurposed for Ubuntu Touch or Sailfish OS because many apps will only work on a specific Android version and up. Same thing with the Google Play store. If you have an older phone that works fine - that&#x27;s great, too bad none of the software can run on it because modern apps are bloated, you need 12GB of RAM on your phone now. Oh sure you can <i>technically</i> run it, but it won&#x27;t rune <i>well</i>.<p>I have three or four Windows phones that still run, but are completely worthless because the software can&#x27;t be updated because the only browser that you could use was Explorer. Now that MS upgraded to Edge, these phones are worthless. Same thing with the Windows apps. I was able to use One Note on my Lumia 950 just as a stand alone note taker, but now it won&#x27;t update because MS says it doesn&#x27;t support that older version and I can&#x27;t update it.<p>I agree 100% hardware makers are one of the reasons, but there&#x27;s a massive issue with the software makers who do the same thing and essentially stop supporting older versions of their software that run fine on these older devices.</div><br/><div id="41774088" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41774088" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nixosbestos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41765975">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41773184">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41773544">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41774088">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41774088">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s so upsetting.

Currently humans generate a significant amount of material which does not have a downstream constituency, and thus is stored, sometimes in less aesthetically acceptable ways like the pictured scrapyard.<p>Since the topic of TFA is e-waste, many comments here promote &quot;right to repair&quot; legislation as a panacea. I don&#x27;t think that &quot;right to repair&quot; addresses the root issue in a broad enough way to make a dent. It only addresses a subset of material, operates at hobby scale, and may mandate certain things, like socketed components, that make full-scale automated recycling more difficult.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Less money but the amount of crippling BS you deal with is vastly less. Basically, you are the only thing on the critical path to delivering anything. A lot of what I do in startups is ruthlessly getting rid of anything that blocks me that I can&#x27;t control.<p>I do some consultancy on the side with bigger companies that are stuck in exactly the way you describe. Because the elephant in the room is usually that product managers vary widely in quality and I&#x27;ve seen them be a bottleneck in quite a few places. There&#x27;s this weird dynamic where you get non technical product managers act more like a CTO and CTOs act more like a VP of engineering in some companies.<p>Since I come in and advice at that level, I get to see this dynamic up close. Good ideas don&#x27;t stand a chance in such companies and they actually end up paying me to tell them to stop doing stupid things that they already know they shouldn&#x27;t be doing to begin with. A lot of companies are not long term sustainable because they fight themselves into corners like that. That&#x27;s why consulting can be so lucrative. You just relay what engineers in the company are saying anyway to their managers. All you need to do is listen and talk authoritatively.<p>A good company would have a culture of being open to sound engineering and be empowering people to make things better. Steve Jobs famously encouraged that in his people and got rid of people that tried to prevent that. Elon Musk apparently does similar things. Neither are&#x2F;were particularly pleasant people to report to but there&#x27;s a pattern in their behavior that they encourage and insist on creative and critical thinking around them. A weak manager does the opposite.

Those last two tend to generate answers that are purely administrative and without substance, such as: <i>We will perform your first mid-year review!</i>.  WTF, so what?<p>Here are some better questions (repeating the first one from the article first):<p>1. <i>“There’s an IC sitting out there who just had an amazing idea for a new feature&#x2F;product. What happens?”</i><p>That question is solid because it indicates they actually give a damn about employee contributions beyond what they populate on a Jira board.  Its a telling sign if they are hostile to initiative.<p>2. <i>&quot;How do you measure things related to your product and what do you measure?&quot;</i><p>The answer to that questions addresses multiple concerns.  Everybody claims to value product quality, but most places I have worked at really don&#x27;t give a shit, because its just too much effort.  If they aren&#x27;t measuring things they have no idea how slow their product is, what kind of user engagement they achieve, their defect trajectory, and on and on and on.  On a more primitive level if they aren&#x27;t currently measuring things it also provides an indication of whether or not they actually want to, but maybe don&#x27;t know how.  The point here is you can use questions like that to cut through their bullshit and determine their level of current capability and also their level of honest versus conservatism.<p>3. <i>&quot;What is your average build time?&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;How do you perform test automation?&quot;</i><p>Most places care more about their tech stack than actually writing software.  That should send all kinds of warning flags.  When developers just waste time all day staring at the ceiling while software goes through a bunch of build nonsense that indicates developer time just isn&#x27;t as valuable testing alternatives.  its great to have 90 minute builds when the business is healthy and you can go out and go bowling, or whatever, but the moment the employer becomes unhealthy those undervalued developers will find themselves unemployed.<p>As a bonus if you ask tough questions during the interview and the challenge makes the hiring manager uncomfortable consider they will remain as uncomfortable if you end up working there.  That is really bad, because shit rolls down hill and their discomfort eventually becomes your problem.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41405933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41405933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">0xbadcafebee</span><span>|</span><a href="#41405533">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41405784">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41405933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41405933">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>“There’s an IC sitting out there who just had an amazing idea for a new feature&#x2F;product.

And if they do, it needs to sound like it&#x27;s coming from an executive, because if it&#x27;s not, they&#x27;ll be embarrassed and try to crush the idea. So if the dev really wants the idea to get into product, they should be funneling the idea through their manager or through a product or sales back-channel.<p><i>“Tell me about your last major migration. How long did it take and how long did you say it was going to take before you started?”</i><p>Bad question, because they always take longer than they expect and always run into problems, and if they don&#x27;t they were just lucky. You&#x27;re asking them to either embarrass themselves to you in the interview, or lie. Not going to give them great feels to remember when they think about your candidacy. Maybe ask them about migrations to see how often they do them, but don&#x27;t lead them to tell you something specific.<p><i>“Let’s say I’m the person you hire. 6 months have gone by, what’s different?”</i><p>&gt; You’d be surprised how often I ask this question and the answer I get back is something like “you’ll be here and doing the job”<p>Yeah, because this is a really bad question. It&#x27;s not their job to make you have an impact. It&#x27;s <i>your</i> job to make an impact. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s <i>a job</i>.

I worked with someone that was horrible, to later find out they were <i>the</i> other dev that I was going to work with later on a contract job. The different environment was night and day.<p>That being said, I do think the signal of a horrible hire can more often than not be detected during an interview.

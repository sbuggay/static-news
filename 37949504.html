You have triangular (or polygonal) mesh, BREP which uses NURBS, SDF which is based on functional representation. I have experience working with triangular meshes and SDF so here are my opinions about them, please correct me if I am wrong:<p>Triangular mesh is conceptually simple, but requires many faces to approximate curved surfaces with high precision (you may be able to use subdivision surface in some cases but intersection&#x2F;union in those cases are more challenging). Also, for more complicated models, floating point errors really add up and you either have to use an exact representation (which is really slow) or try some other approaches which can be robust w.r.t. errors (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elalish&#x2F;manifold">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elalish&#x2F;manifold</a> but it is really hard to get right). Another disadvantage comparing with BREP is the lack of constraint solving, which I will write about it below.<p>SDF is nice for mathematically defined objects. They are computationally intensive, so some sdf libraries use GPU to speedup the computation. There are approaches that can speed up the evaluation, but doesn&#x27;t work well if the function is not really the distance (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;curv3d&#x2F;curv&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;shapes&#x2F;Shapes.rst#signed-distance-fields">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;curv3d&#x2F;curv&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;shapes&#x2F;Shape...</a>).<p>-----<p>Constraints solving: This is a big problem with mesh-based CAD. Traditional CAD usually allows you to have under-defined constraints, and users can iteratively set constraints until the model is fully defined. There is no such a thing (yet) with mesh-based CAD. Also, we don&#x27;t really have nice ways to represent constraints relative to curved surfaces because there is no curved surface in our mesh...<p>Also, one particular challenge with text-based (or code-based) CAD is how to select the surfaces with an ergonomic API. GUI can solve this problem but writing a good GUI is a complicated task (that I am not willing to touch).</div><br/></div></div><div id="37952660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37952660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dymk</span><span>|</span><a href="#37952556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37953193">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37952607">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37952660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37952660">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fornjot.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fornjot.app&#x2F;</a> is an attempt, and also good at showing what a large undertaking such a goal is</div><br/></div></div><div id="37952607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37952607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">auggierose</span><span>|</span><a href="#37952556">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37952660">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37952651">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37952607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37952607">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So what&#x27;s so difficult about such a kernel?

Where CAD matters professionally,  there usually are strict requirements or business rules that would rule out an &quot;average .OBJ files that had these tags&quot;<p>Now, I AM optimistic about algorithms solving for useful relationships between pre-defined objects, like routing conduit through a building without collisions or optimizing a lumber cut-list. Finch and Hypar are interesting small companies in this space.</div><br/><div id="37952089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37952089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">techdragon</span><span>|</span><a href="#37951006">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37951890">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37952089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37952089">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Having an expert (or other more specialised software) optimise an otherwise satisfactory 3d model is going to be vastly more simple a process than what can be a painstaking process of getting the âoriginal visionâ for a shape into a digital form.<p>Iâm better with CAD style workflows than I am with Freeform modelling, but Iâm also not an experienced enough user of any particular CAD program that I donât spend ages frustratingly trying to understand where to go to edit the correct part of the chain of operations that built up a particular fillet, chamfer, or sweep, every program is a little differentâ¦ just different enough to throw me off since I donât use them often enough to really get over that learning threshold, for instance Iâve used Onshape one time in the last 12 monthsâ¦ spent an hour trying to work something outâ¦ and then 5 minutes actually making my editâ¦<p>If I could have opened up the design in 2d blueprints form, and put in some kind of multi modal query to the effect of âthese are my blueprints, can you convert them to (CAD program of choice), and while you are converting them, increase cross section CS1 vertically to from 8mm to 10mm keeping everything else fixedâ â¦ would save me a lot of time making adjustments to peoples 3d models for printing.

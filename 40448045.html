From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; <i>Ford Motor created an ad campaign for the Mercury Sable that specifically was meant to inspire nostalgic sentiments through the use of famous songs from the 1970s sung by their original artists. When the original artists refused to accept, impersonators were used to sing the original songs for the commercials. Midler was asked to sing a famous song of hers for the commercial and refused. Subsequently, the company hired a voice-impersonator of Midler and carried on with using the song for the commercial, since it had been approved by the copyright-holder.</i> [1]<p>If you ask an artist to sing a famous song of hers, she says no, and you get someone else to impersonate her, that gets you in hot water.<p>If you (perhaps because you are savvy) go to some unknown voice actress, have her record a voice for your chatbot, later go to a famous actress known for one time playing a chatbot in a movie, and are declined, you are in a much better position. The tweet is still a thorn in OA&#x27;s side, of course, but that&#x27;s not likely to be determinative IMO (IAAL).<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Midler_v._Ford_Motor_Co</a>.</div><br/><div id="40452209" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40452209" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus_holmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#40451982">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40452148">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40452247">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40452209">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40452209">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The actress did impersonate Her though.<p>It&#x27;s not just a random &quot;voice for your chatbot&quot;, it&#x27;s that particularly breathy, chatty, voice that she performed for the movie.<p>I would agree with you completely if they&#x27;d created a completely different voice.

Here is a relevant precedence, for instance, that may or may not change your mind:<p>Tom Waits is a singer known for his raspy singing voice. Back in the late 1980s, Frito-Lay, Inc., the makes of Doritos, thought it was a great idea to run an ad in which the music had the atmosphere and feel of a Tom Waits song. Except the professional singer they hired for that got the job done a bit too well: the sounds of his voice in the commercial was so close to Tom Waits&#x27; work (he had for ten years sang in a band covering Tom Waits songs) that in November 1988, Waits successfully sued Frito-Lay and the advertising company Tracy-Locke Inc., for voice misappropriation under California law and false endorsement under the Lanham Act [1].<p>Now, when you hear Tom Waits speak in interviews, I find that his voice does not sound nearly as raspy as in his performances. But the point is that it does not matter so much whether OpenAI used the actual voice of Johansson or hired someone to imitate her performance.<p>Given the fact that Johansson was initially contacted by OpenAI to provide her voice and declined, we can surely assume that the selection of the particular voice actress they ended up using was no coincidence.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;law2.umkc.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ftrials&#x2F;communications&#x2F;waits.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;law2.umkc.edu&#x2F;faculty&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ftrials&#x2F;communications...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40452031" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40452031" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">borispavlovic</span><span>|</span><a href="#40451946">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40452092">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451636">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40452031">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40452031">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Trust me I’m not a huge fan of OpenAI anymore and I think they deserve criticism for many things.

Sam tweeted &quot;her&quot;, not due to the voice, but due the existence of a conversational system that resembled the system in the movie. This primed people to hear Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s voice in a generically cheerful female voice actor who was contracted over half a year ago. Scarlett&#x27;s lawyers encourage her to write a public letter, helping Scarlett with the wording, in order to steer the public narrative, in order to place pressure on OpenAI to settle with her financially out of court.</div><br/><div id="40452162" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40452162" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jamespo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40451411">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451617">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40452143">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40452162">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40452162">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s an alternative explanation all right</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40452143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40452143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">facialwipe</span><span>|</span><a href="#40451411">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451181">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40452143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40452143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">@sama has done a good job at portraying himself as an elon&#x2F;zuck hybrid visionary. he&#x27;s either going to deliver on the agi promise or be the next @sbf_ftx. there&#x27;s no in between.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40451412" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40451412" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abrookewood</span><span>|</span><a href="#40451181">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40451412">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40451412">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If they are so confident that they didn&#x27;t copy her voice, then why did they pull that character&#x2F;version?</div><br/><div id="40451665" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40451665" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gnicholas</span><span>|</span><a href="#40451412">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40451665">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40451665">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wondered about this also.

So random chances of someone literally sounding by DNA from half a world away is quite low.</div><br/><div id="40451816" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40451816" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gambiting</span><span>|</span><a href="#40449041">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451031">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40451816">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40451816">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re talking about literal identical voice due to throat development and cultural background etc - which is obviously technically true, but I imagine a number of people who sound 99% like you(where a casual listener can&#x27;t tell the difference) must be quite large.<p>Case in point - my wife has two twin brothers. Even though I&#x27;ve been interacting with them for over 10 years now, they sound exactly the same to me. If I close my eyes then there is zero chance I could tell them apart by voice alone. I know, it&#x27;s an anecdote - but while I&#x27;m sure you <i>could</i> tell them apart by some really small thing that they do, to someone who isn&#x27;t actively looking for those cues they are - for all intentions and purposes - the same.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40451031" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40451031" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trevyn</span><span>|</span><a href="#40449041">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451057">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40451180">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40451031">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40451031">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>How can I protect myself in such a situation?</i><p>Choose a different career, like maybe public-opinion influencer.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

It is the answer 99% of the time, I know quite a few high-profile managers at this point and they are all very smart and get stuff done people and yet they allow themselves be dragged into endless meetings and they know the script (that the OP author is referring to several times) and they recite it by heart. Because if they don&#x27;t, <i>their</i> manager is going to think they are useless and will inevitably fire them.<p>People find a cushy place to work in with a good salary, then just work their way up the economical ladder (or the organizational) and will do <i>anything</i> that&#x27;s needed to achieve that goal. It&#x27;s as simple as that, and I am convinced that a good chunk of these people (probably 20%-30%) are very well aware they are bullshitters but they think they have no choice.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;ve known a few company owners long time ago who were just BEGGING their managers to tell them the problems exactly as they are, swore on their lives they will not fire the managers for bringing them bad news (and made contracts that made sure of it in no uncertain terms)... and yet all of the managers below those people were sycophant yes-men.<p>Quite tragic really.

No, seriously.<p>Imagine the kind of flexibility an ordinary person has to build into everything else they have going on to make &quot;I&#x27;d just move&quot; a viable long term strategy. Buying property immediately becomes way more hassle than it&#x27;s worth, because you might have to move in 6 months to the next place anyway. Providing a stable schooling situation for your kids just became a lot harder. Want to avoid those issues? Are you willing to pay for rent or a mortgage in a city large enough where you can keep running this strategy, over and over again? What about the situation where the culture is actually fine, but you yourself just want more money or more responsibility than they&#x27;re willing to pass down to you? It&#x27;s an interesting example of how when you hold one thing fixed in place, everything else has to orbit around it. Very few people get to have it all without putting in a lot of work to get there first.<p>Like a lot of societal ills, I think this is one place where remote working is going to make things a lot better for people even while a vocal minority will bemoan how it&#x27;s all worse than ever. Many, many, many talented people would be <i>thrilled</i> to live in a world where they can live in the same gorgeous small town in the middle of nowhere they call home while also feeling like they aren&#x27;t running a serious risk of unemployment if they give up the one job they managed to claw out of the aether.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

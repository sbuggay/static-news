Constants can be extracted and with a little help of DDG, every file can be updated to its kts version.<p>But that is just the beginning. It seems to be a rule that every single thing must be possible to do in at least two different ways.<p>I came out of that process convinced that, no, for most ordinary projects a lot of precious time can be saved by using Maven despite the &quot;uglyness&quot; of the pom.<p>Maven encourages sticking to the standards. Every time you do something correctly it rewards you be letting you remove more configuration, and in the end you have something that works well, is fast enough, and is immediately recognizable for every experienced Java developer.<p>Everytime I see the &quot;elephant balancing on the ball&quot; illustration that is sometimes used for Gradle courses I chuckle for myself and think it is perfect: It is a impressive, but one tiny mistake away from collapsing and breaking something big time.</div><br/><div id="35709774" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35709774" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">creatonez</span><span>|</span><a href="#35709717">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35709786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35709774">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35709774">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Maven encourages sticking to the standards.

I wrote multiple custom plugins and maintain them still. Learning how gradle works was hard. The official docs didn’t help in the beginning. I only know how to author build scripts because I spend a lot of time in the internals. I don’t use many third party plugins because they never 100% work as intended and become a liability later on when a gradle update is needed.<p>But do I think it is too complicated and abstract? Yes and No. The main problem is that gradle contains a load of old Bagage. Most concepts which are still in the product center around lazy evaluation and to decouple the what from how. The introduction of Providers a couple of years ago was a pivotal point. Writing lazy evaluated scripts was only possible through private methods which used groovy magic to implement this. I never saw a build system or build tool be just simple when the desired outcome is decoupled and fast builds. Would I pick gradle today? I guess not. But I still think it is a great tool. I looked at nix and hazel and these tools are also not simple.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35709730" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35709730" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bedatadriven</span><span>|</span><a href="#35709646">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35709593">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35709730">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35709730">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I work with a large project built with gradle that includes a lot of custom code generation and other automation very specific to our project.

Adding a new source set is a one-liner, then just put your code generation logic in src&#x2F;generator&#x2F;java.<p>Add a JavaExec task to run your main class and, optionally define inputs and outputs to enable up-to-date checking.

Mostly because the options weren&#x27;t any better.<p>Gradle&#x27;s main problem is that it doesn&#x27;t have a learning curve, it has a learning cliff. You either understand it or you don&#x27;t and that is terrible for adoption and for people trying to get it like this fellow.<p>What lies beyond this stage is understanding that these things -are- actually complex for a reason. Attempting to create something simpler just for your &quot;simple&quot; use case eventually requires you to add more stuff to do some new thing and before you know it you have a shitty version of Gradle instead of normal Gradle with some custom plugins&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;whatever you happen to need.<p>That said I&#x27;m in the process of going deep on Bazel because Gradle still falls short of the mark for me. Bazel has more of an actual learning curve, it&#x27;s peak complexity is lower than Gradle (though mostly because it&#x27;s offloaded that complexity into rulesets).<p>The reality is that these build systems are hard because they are designed to solve very hard problems when you are building programs with lots of artefacts at big scale where very fine grained caching isn&#x27;t just nice to have but imperative in order to actually do builds at a reasonable cadence.<p>Appreciation of these systems is tightly coupled to -actually- having those problems. If you don&#x27;t have those problems you probably don&#x27;t get why these things are so complicated&#x2F;baroque&#x2F;alien&#x2F;whatever they may seem to you.<p>In Gradle&#x27;s case you can generally build a bunch of JVM code without really understanding Gradle. I consider this to be a bit of a trap but I get -why- it&#x27;s like this which is that it would simply have no adoption if everyone had to understand the phases, source sets, etc but I still don&#x27;t like copy&#x2F;paste builds all the same.<p>Bazel is both slightly better and slightly worse in this regard. You need to understand some more Bazel concepts to build anything at all - which I consider a good thing, understanding vs copy-paste is good in my book. However that understanding is a bit of an illusion once you realise you need something with a modicum of more complexity.<p>Soon you will open up a ruleset and realise that for instance the inbuilt rules_java is actually lugging around this JavaInfo thing and rules that are &quot;java aware&quot; are doing things with this rather than &quot;just artefacts&quot; as your simple understanding was let you to believe etc.<p>Most programmers don&#x27;t give build systems that respect they deserve. They want them to just work and be out of their way, mostly because they don&#x27;t care how their artefacts get built. I think this is both wrong and sad but I also don&#x27;t see it changing, too many incentives to not care as long as it builds. Meaning that understanding of real build systems is concentrated on a small number of individuals at a few places big enough to need them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35709598" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35709598" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex_lav</span><span>|</span><a href="#35709690">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35709856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35709598">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35709598">[15 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; During my period of intense frustration with Gradle I found this condescending blog post claiming that anyone who dislikes it is simply using it wrong.<p>Replace Gradle with literally any tech tool and you&#x27;ll find the same articles.

Git Koans [0], which is now 10 years old, still holds mostly true.  I do feel it has improved, though not in ways I&#x27;ve bothered to use.  `git switch` for example, was introduced at, uh, some point because `checkout` is so overloaded.<p>Anyway, git was the first and only VCS I ever learned so I don&#x27;t really see the big deal myself.  I didn&#x27;t learn all the internals super well, but I generally did just learned it.  On the same token I&#x27;ve never really heard of a VCS that people don&#x27;t complain about.

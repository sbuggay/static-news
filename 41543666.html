The fear is real, and 100% more tangible when you&#x27;re holding your child the first few times. Overcome with love, joy and sadness because you cannot comprehend how anyone could treat someone that they love so deeply in a bad way.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;made it&quot; is the differentiator here. It&#x27;s more about emotional maturity and acceptance that you&#x27;re chiefly responsible for another human beings experience of the world: What you put in can set them up, or break them down.<p>That said, I created some rules for myself:<p><pre><code>  1. Never lie to children. It&#x27;s easy to make up a story to avoid an emotional outburst. People that lie cannot be trusted, trust is the cornerstone of a relationship, don&#x27;t lie.
  2. Don&#x27;t avoid emotions. Lean in. Feeling emotions is a human right. Let kids feel emotions. Be with them and make them feel safe. Through conversation try to dissect, explain and appreciate why they&#x27;re feeling emotional.
  3. Hug them. Only let go when they let go.
  4. Say goodbye. Don&#x27;t sneak out the house to avoid an emotional outburst. Not understanding where a parent went, or why you missed them leaving is traumatic. Say goodbye.
  5. Never pretend that you&#x27;ll leave them. Kid is at playground and doesn&#x27;t want to leave? Never faux walk away and pretend you&#x27;re leaving without them. Fear is not a parenting strategy, it&#x27;s abuse.

I’m happy, live a life I find deeply meaningful and fulfilling, don’t suffer from any depression, I have a wife and two kids. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life. My teens and 20s were really rough, I spent a lot of time ruminating and just being a sourpuss. But I mostly knew I didn’t want to be like the people I’d been surrounded by when I was a kid. I got over it and stopped worrying about it so much. I’m lucky I found a good wife, we’ve talked for probably thousands of hours about our childhoods and worked out a lot of stuff. I feel like I’m continually improving. I just don’t worry too much, in my 20s I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression but those are basically non existent now.<p>The thing I purposely try to avoid when starting a new job is talking about my upbringing and background too early. I didn’t tell people at my current job my youngest daughter is in a wheelchair until about three months in. I let people form their judgments from how effective I am at work, then reveal more about my personal life. That first impression is so important. If people think you’re damaged goods from the get go you’ll get their pity, which is not what you want. You want their respect. Pity in a workplace means career death.<p>I’ve started riding my bike regularly which seems to have a very similar effect to taking Adderall.

Since the rise of the modern primary system for electing US Presidents most of our Presidents had traumatic childhoods(1). It seems like most of the people who want a stadium full of people chanting their names are trying to fill the hole where parental love should have been. Of course, most people don&#x27;t grow up to be President, so I don&#x27;t think this isn&#x27;t something that you should be optimizing for!<p>I think where I ultimately come down on this (and I&#x27;m a dad so I&#x27;ve given this a lot of thought) is that a crappy childhood is a high risk play: it might give you a slightly better chance of a really amazing outcome, but at a much greater risk of a truly terrible outcome. A happy childhood doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything, none of us are guaranteed anything. But it can make truly negative outcomes less likely- though again not impossible. So all things being equal, I want my son to feel loved.<p>1: Just looking at the Baby Boomer presidents, and staying far away from actual politics, Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe, his dad died in a car accident before he was even born and his mom remarried and he was adopted. GWBush had a famously withholding and demanding mother and was viewed as the family scapegoat into his 30&#x27;s- JEB! was the golden child in that family, George was the family screw-up. Barack Obama wrote an entire book (when he was a campaigning for an Illinois State Senate seat, long before he thought about running for President) about how he never really had a relationship with his father and what effect that absence had on his life. Donald Trump wears much of the damage Fred Trump inflicted on him on his sleeve.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41550001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41550001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chasd00</span><span>|</span><a href="#41552982">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41551761">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41550001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41550001">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">ACR score of 7 all the people involved in that score are dead save for 1.

It wasn&#x27;t always this way, and I owe a LOT to great teachers in my formative years (HS and some college) who encouraged me to get the hell out of the house, city, and state I grew up in, and become my own man far far away from the place and family of my birth.<p>I&#x27;d been on the &#x27;gifted&#x27; track since pre-K (I was reading books without pictures by 3, for example, and had read The Hobbit in Kindergarten).  I made it out (barely) of one of the worst public middle&#x2F;highschool systems in the country, and got a 70%+ 4 year scholarship into one of the best.  My grandparents (specifically my maternal grandmother, may she RIP) busted all kinds of ass to make up the difference.  &quot;Family drama&quot; almost made it to where I couldn&#x27;t get transport to out-of-state college at the very last minute, and my paternal grandfather (may HE RIP!) showed up out of the blue, helped me throw my things in his truck, and drove me 12 hours one-way so I could attend college (no I did not finish, and dropped out after 4 years; long story)<p>The fear, doubt, and insecurity of my teens led to quite a bit of learning and growing in my early&#x2F;mid 20s, and it just got better from there.  &quot;Getting the hell out&quot; was the best advice I had gotten, and I am so glad I was able to take it.<p>My biggest concern these days is how do I grow beyond my damaged upbringing and not just be a &quot;neutral&quot; force in my family&#x27;s life, but a &quot;good&quot; one.

They could leave, you could leave. The best work friends you have, you might stay in touch. You&#x27;ll both look back on your time together fondly. But lasting relationships aren&#x27;t usually found at the workplace. (Though they _can_.)<p>And absolutely don&#x27;t seek fulfillment from an employer. You&#x27;re fulfilling <i>them</i> - their needs, wishes, and goals. They&#x27;re fulfilling contractual obligations to you through your bank account just as you&#x27;re fulfilling your work obligations to them through your efforts.<p>Fulfillment comes from acceptance of who you are, personal appreciation of what you&#x27;re good at, and doing things for your own personal satisfaction - not because it&#x27;s demanded of you by someone else. Honestly, just look how far you&#x27;ve come. That&#x27;s an accomplishment in and of itself and is worthy of appreciation. Nobody will ever tell you when &quot;you&#x27;ve arrived&quot; (other than your GPS). It comes through personal realization that you&#x27;re a grown adult now, you&#x27;re charting your own course in life, you can go where you want and do what you want. You&#x27;re where you are because of your own actions. If you ever find yourself truly loathing where you are, you can change it. Finding contentment with where you are in life (geographically, financially, etc) is up to you. Don&#x27;t like it, you can change it.

Maybe consider me to be qualified to comment, however.<p>I understand &quot;unsafe&#x27;, albeit this is a little vague. But I get it. Given that, I surmise that your core resultant issue is unyielding anxiety. That&#x27;s rough, and arguably the roughest.<p>What you are likely missing is truly competent support. Which would be either a smart family member, a rare engaged friend, or a rare professional. That&#x27;s what most Autistic 1 people will be missing: a talented mediator between them and the world. Double plus so if the patient has trauma (ie: ACE 6).<p>If you are lacking true support, you are lucky that you aren&#x27;t underemployed or even homeless. In that, you are quite accomplished. Keep in mind that many or even most other people in your divergent position aren&#x27;t so. Good on you.<p>In my opinion, everyone with Autism 1 should be considered to be at risk for homelessness and provided with engaged support by one institution or another (under insurance). And that there should be specialists trained to socially assist those with Autism 1. Not with social training, but with workplace and associated mediation. And then with expert career guidance as a distant second. Logically in my opinion, a next step for screening the homeless and drug addicts, after they get clean, should be for autism.<p>Relentlessly seek that support, even if you have to pay for it, in order to help to continue to assure your good status. It may take awhile to find, but the search doesn&#x27;t start until it does.<p>I&#x27;m a little bit curious about comorbid autism and ADHD. I&#x27;d make a mid-confidence wager that you are referring to ADHD-PI. On a personal note, I think that ADHD-PI is usually if not always a symptom of Autism 1. In other words, it is a spectrum symptom.

I did good career wise, failure was just not an option to me so I worked hard. At school I was put into accelerated classes for gifted kids. But I feel like I could have done a lot better with more support at home. I see that people get points for diversity etc. in college or hiring, but there is no such support for people who suffer silently, and even if there was I have too much pride to let others know just for some brownie points. Life was particularly hard before I found employment, roughly from the age of 18 to 26. That was also the period when my mental health challenges were more difficult and I had not yet learned how to cope. I have not yet gotten any ‘treatment’ for mental health issues. I got some money after making some fortunate investment decisions that allowed me to climb out of poverty, it might be trivial sum for most people out there but it was a lot to me. Lately I get feelings of being an orphan, just out there on my own and not having my own people to share things with or support in life.<p>My wife is startled sometimes when I react as I do, she doesn’t understand where it comes from. I have forgetfulness and emotional regulation issues. But she is a nice person and helps me out.<p>I worry about money and the future all the time.<p>I would like to thank my mom and God for everything, and Jensen Huang.
Will delete this later.<p>Sorry for poor punctuation and english.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41553114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41553114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tamua-throwaway</span><span>|</span><a href="#41554048">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41553114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41553114">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you think you know who I am, no you don&#x27;t.

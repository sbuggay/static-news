I don&#x27;t mind paying taxes, but I don&#x27;t want to have to pay them twice.  UK taxes are generally higher than US taxes, and there are tax treaties to avoid double taxation, so no problem, right?<p>Wrong.  First, if a US citizen owns more than 10% of a foreign corporation, there&#x27;s an insanely complicated form you have to fill out, two pages of which are incomprehensible questions (&quot;Is your company considered an X corporation under sections Y and Z of the Blablablah act?&quot;) that simply require an expert to fill out.<p>Secondly, if a US citizens owns more than <i>50%</i> of a foreign company, by default, income from that company counts as personal income, <i>but taxes paid by the company to another government don&#x27;t count as personal taxes</i>.  You can get around this, apparently, but it&#x27;s even more complicated.<p>So because of [REDACTED] lawyers and accountants that have come up with these schemes, I have to spend precious starting capital to a bunch of accountants to prove I&#x27;m not evading taxes, rather than actually doing something useful with that money (and that accountant doing something more useful with their time).</div><br/><div id="41574086" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41574086" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gerdesj</span><span>|</span><a href="#41573300">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41575943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41574086">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41574086">[37 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The &quot;problem&quot; you describe is your US citizenship requires you to pay tax on earnings from outside the US - that&#x27;s a condition of US citizenship.

An ESTA (great scheme IMO) costs about £20 for two years coverage - more than enough to visit the relos.<p>I know from second hand experience that our bureaucracy is just as convoluted as any other and it will take roughly one to two years (that was about 10 years ago) to get citizenship and probably involves a test that I would fail!<p>You might like to look into where your company is actually registered.

For example, in the UK, using an ISA, which is a form of bank savings account, for which the interest is paid tax free.  ISAs were created by an Act of Parliament.  By saving in an ISA you avoid paying some tax.<p>Tax evasion is avoiding paying tax ... by not paying tax that is due, according to the law of the land.<p>There are no grey areas these days.  When you do &quot;Self Assessment&quot; in the UK, one of the early questions paraphrases to &quot;have you done anything dodgy&quot;.  I think it is something like: &quot;Have you participated in any tax evasion schemes within the tax year considered here&quot;.  Without looking it up now (which takes a while), it may even use the word avoidance instead of evasion.<p>Self assessment is similar to how the US and some other countries do taxation.<p>In the UK the norm is Pay As You Earn (PAYE).  Your employer does everything - you earn a wage and tax (Income Tax and National Insurance) is extracted at source and the balance is paid to you.  The taxes are passed on to His Majesty&#x27;s Customs and Revenue (HMRC).  You can fill in a Form P11D if you want to claim expenses for something you supplied or pay for benefits received from your employment.  Most employees in the UK don&#x27;t care about taxation too much - it just happens.<p>Tax avoidance and evasion are very different beasts.

So, without having looked into the legal details of this specific ruling, I’m not even sure if it makes the Irish law <i>invalid</i>, as opposed to merely illegal.

Tax evasion is illegal. Tax avoidance is not. Tax evasion means you are doing something illegal to not pay taxes, taxes that you would otherwise owe for example if the government had total knowledge of your financial records. Tax avoidance means you are staying within the letter of the law and that your actions taken in the process of doing everything you can to limit the taxes you owe are legal actions.<p>It&#x27;s quite simply the difference between taking legal and illegal action. And if the IRS were to be fully aware of what you&#x27;ve done, whether you have broken the law or not. With tax avoidance you do everything you can to not actually break the law (you want to take max advantage without crossing the line). With tax evasion you are breaking the law.<p>The IRS will almost always try to nail you for tax evasion if they find out what you&#x27;re doing. The IRS will rarely be able to get you for something related to tax avoidance if you&#x27;re very careful &#x2F; strict about it and stay within the letter of the law. Obviously this applies in the US context, however I find that very commonly when people discuss tax evasion vs tax avoidance, they&#x27;re talking about the premise I&#x27;m talking about: one is about taking illegal actions, one is legal and narrowly walks the letter of the law to limit taxes.</div><br/><div id="41574560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41574560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">christophilus</span><span>|</span><a href="#41572916">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41573932">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41572942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41574560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41574560">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Exactly.

There are so many carved-out special interest exceptions that it&#x27;s almost impossible to unravel, like the carried interest tax credit for hedge fund management fees.<p>I think we&#x27;ve reached the point where we need revenue apportinment of profit. That means if 50% of your revenue comes from the US, then (at least) 50% of your profit is taxable in the US.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that there are various schemes for multinationals to avoid taking profits in the US. One of the most common is transfer pricing. Example: Company A sells sofas to US consumers for $1000. It buys them from subsidiary B (in Bermuda) for $900. Subsidiary B buys the sofas from Subsidiary C in China for $300 each. So $600 in profit is moved to a 0% tax haven like Bermuda. That&#x27;s transfer pricing and it&#x27;s illegal.<p>The Double Irish Sandwich is an example of profit shifting. What&#x27;s the difference between profit shifting and transfer pricing? Profit shifting is legal. Transfer pricing isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s functionally the difference.<p>So an argument against revenue appointment of profit is you can use similar schemes to hide profits but you really can&#x27;t. For one, companies need to report profits to shareholders so the IRS has that data point. For another, the IRS can and does go after companies to figure out beneficial ownership and whether transactions really are at arm&#x27;s length or not.<p>For anyone saying they can benefit from this by buying shares in $BIG_TECH$, I promise you that you would benefit more from that company paying taxes to fund the roads, bridges and schools that you would from your 100 shares going up by an extra 1%.</div><br/><div id="41574658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41574658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refurb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41573481">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41573865">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41574658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41574658">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What do you mean “transfer pricing is illegal”?<p>Transfer pricing is a normal part of business and done all the time and is legal.<p>Presumably you mean “hiding profit through transfer pricing is illegal”?</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41573865" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41573865" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dennis_jeeves2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41573481">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41573865">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41573865">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That taxation exists and is widely regarded as necessary (evil) in the first place is a sobering reminder of the average IQ of the populace.</div><br/><div id="41574084" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41574084" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gosub100</span><span>|</span><a href="#41573865">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41574084">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41574084">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">did you forget that you can move, right now, to a country with no income tax?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

Pytheas describes the Pretanike.  Change the P for a B and allow that -ike is an old Greek ending and you can see where Britain comes from.

Read a few commentaries and sort of spiral in on the original work, if you really want to. It will give you knowledge and perspective that will make reading it more fruitful. Virtue law ethics and natural law theory are key terms. (David Oderberg has published some recent introductory texts [0][1] in this vein, but I have not read them.

Both Aristotle and Stoics claim that virtue is an essential component of happiness. But while Aristotle sees happiness as dependent on a combination of virtue and bodily goods (for instance, health) and external goods (for instance, money, power and friends), for the Stoics happiness depends solely on virtue. Thus, for Aristotle virtue is necessary for happiness, but not sufficient, whereas for the Stoics it is both necessary and sufficient.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernstoicism.com&#x2F;aristotelian-and-stoic-happiness-by-gabriele-galluzzo-and-chris-gill&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernstoicism.com&#x2F;aristotelian-and-stoic-happiness-...</a><p>&gt; * If all external things are deemed by the Stoa unnecessary for our happiness, this will include other people. Yet the affect of love, with its valuation of the other and her good as part of our own, seems to be set irremovably deep in our nature and infancy, and to be the portal to the most meaningful experiences of life: a thought underlying Aristotle’s arguments concerning philia. The Stoic opposition to the pathē more widely, likewise, seems psychologically unrealistic – since passions like love and fear are so basic to our psyches – and to threaten to rob our subjective lives of too much of what gives them their colour. Finally, at a more technical level, the Stoic emphases on virtue as a technē or epistēmē seems to rob practical rationality of the subtle flexibility Aristotle’s differentiation of praxis and phronēsis had won for virtue ethics, and to point forwards towards Kant’s and the utilitarians’ paradoxically impractical, rule-based moralities (Kant greatly admired the Stoics).*<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.routledgehandbooks.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.4324&#x2F;9781315729053.ch3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.routledgehandbooks.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.4324&#x2F;9781315729053...</a></div><br/><div id="36547731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36547731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bandrami</span><span>|</span><a href="#36544309">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36545829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36545971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36547731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36547731">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just here to throw in that the English word &quot;happiness&quot; probably doesn&#x27;t give a great sense of the Greek εὐδαιμονία but it&#x27;s what we&#x27;re stuck with.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36545971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36545971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mberning</span><span>|</span><a href="#36544309">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36545829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36547731">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36547763">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36545971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36545971">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seneca seemed to have an Aristotelian streak.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36547763" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36547763" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">revskill</span><span>|</span><a href="#36544309">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36545663">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36547763">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36547763">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why do i care if i&#x27;m living well or not ?

MacIntyre asks what the sciences would look like if they were re-assembled from the remnants of scientific knowledge that survived the catastrophe.</i><p>&gt; <i>He claims that the new sciences, though superficially similar to the old, would in fact be devoid of real scientific content, because the key suppositions and attitudes would not be present. &quot;The hypothesis which I wish to advance&quot;, he continues, &quot;is that in the actual world which we inhabit the language of morality is in the same state of grave disorder as the language of natural science in the imaginary world which I described.&quot;[2] Specifically, MacIntyre applies this hypothesis to advance the notion that the moral structures that emerged from the Enlightenment were philosophically doomed from the start because they were formed using the aforementioned incoherent language of morality. MacIntyre claims that this failure encompasses the work of many significant Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment moral philosophers, including Søren Kierkegaard, Karl Marx, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume. These philosophers &quot;fail because of certain shared characteristics deriving from their highly specific historical background.&quot;[3] That background is the Enlightenment&#x27;s abandonment of Aristotelianism, and in particular the Aristotelian concept of teleology.</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>Another reason MacIntyre gives for the doomed nature of the Enlightenment is the fact that it ascribed moral agency to the individual. He claims this made morality no more than one man&#x27;s opinion and, thus, philosophy became a forum of inexplicably subjective rules and principles. The failure of the Enlightenment Project, because of the abandonment of a teleological structure, is shown by the inadequacy of moral emotivism, which MacIntyre believes accurately reflects the state of modern morality.</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>In the end, however, MacIntyre tells us that we are waiting not for Godot but for Benedict of Nursia. MacIntyre criticizes individualist political philosophy, such as John Rawls&#x27;</i> A Theory of Justice <i>and Robert Nozick&#x27;s</i> Anarchy, State, and Utopia. <i>To MacIntyre, morals and virtues can only be comprehended through their relation to the community which they come from. Whereas Rawls tells us to conceive of justice through abstracting ourselves from who we are (through the veil of ignorance, for example) MacIntyre disagrees. Running throughout</i> After Virtue <i>is the belief that in order to comprehend who we are, we must understand where we come from.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;After_Virtue" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;After_Virtue</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;332138" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;332138</a><p>Even if you don&#x27;t necessarily agree with his final conclusion, I think MacIntyre does a decent job of examining various ethic systems that that been presented in (Western) philosophy, and trying to poke holes in them.

Practically speaking we can&#x27;t go 24 hours without food, it is essential. Most people are totally dependent on others to provide their food; look at any city - the population density is too high for people to grow their own food. The food providers have no inherent incentive to make food cheap. It is totally against their interests. A shallow look at the situation suggests food providers should be able to squeeze people until all the money goes to farmers. But that isn&#x27;t what happens, food is actually absurdly cheap and available given how important it is and how much needs to happen to produce it.<p>The situation with insurers is similar. If there was a real market that people could enter, competitive pressure would force them to be cheap. If the market was, hypothetically, choked by regulation then they&#x27;d be in a great position to charge absurd prices.<p>Market incentives are odd beasts. It is technically against the interests of the insurers to negotiate lower prices - unless they are competing with other insurers. Then it is in their interests to offer fair prices.<p>(if it isn&#x27;t clear, I think I&#x27;m agreeing with you)</div><br/><div id="39533600" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39533600" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hx8</span><span>|</span><a href="#39530889">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39533334">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39535388">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39533600">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39533600">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there are a couple of pitfalls in looking at healthcare as a free market.<p>* People often have to make uninformed decisions or have decisions made for them in an emergency.  This naturally puts them at an economic disadvantage in the market place.  We consider it unfair because it&#x27;s the sick, injured that are disadvantaged.<p>* We have strict regulations about ensuring access to health care.  People aren&#x27;t turned away in an emergency.  Sick people aren&#x27;t treated differently for insurance.  There are thousands of other regulations we do that shape the &#x27;free&#x27; market.<p>* Food is far from a free market, although it might look that way from the consumer standpoint.  The government helps in both ensuring a strong supply with farm bills and giving $114B&#x2F;yr in SNAP on the consumption side.</div><br/><div id="39534440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39534440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rapatel0</span><span>|</span><a href="#39530889">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39533600">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39533772">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39534440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39534440">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve never understood The concept of competition in insurance. Fundamentally it’s about pooling funds to average out risk. We had this nonsensical system where we socially subsidize the most expensive (Medicare) and privatize lower risk.

I suspect the vast majority of engagement (and, spending) with the medical industry is non-emergency care. At least not emergency care required in the next hour or so.  There are edge cases, but even considering most of what I&#x27;ve seen going to the emergency room there has been time to choose which hospital to head for.<p>Basically I think this is over-weighting the importance of emergency care. I don&#x27;t have any stats on hand, but people entering the hospital system at ultra-short-notice is quite rare in my experience compared to having a bit of time to think. Most healthcare engagement seems to be for planned consultation, planned surgeries, emergencies but with hours to spare and then urgent emergencies. In about that order of frequency, and heavily weighted towards the first few cases.<p>2. People are more than capable of figuring out which of two options are cheaper. The ability of consumers to reject goods over tiny price differentials is legendary.<p>3. If people aren&#x27;t up for the challenge of figuring out what to do in an emergency, then in a fair market you&#x27;d probably find the insurer starts to step in and assist. If the insurer has to compete for business, they have a very strong incentive to make sure their customers get good and cost-effective care.<p>4. And on food markets; those are distortions to the market, not limits on it&#x27;s freedom. A free market can be distorted with subsidies and it is still free. The important factors are whether new providers can enter the market and whether they are allowed to compete on price and service quality.</div><br/><div id="39534005" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39534005" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Guvante</span><span>|</span><a href="#39530889">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39533772">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39534012">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39534005">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39534005">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No one knows how much care costs.

In most cases it&#x27;s actually DOUBLE the premium you&#x27;re paying for malpractice insurance, implying the insurer believes that your coverage is less than one-third of the claims they expect to pay. What -should- happen is that you carry &quot;claims-made and prior acts&quot; coverage. The challenge there is that in many cases your employer will cover claims-made as part of your compensation or part of their insurance, but don&#x27;t elect prior acts coverage (and because of the way they do it, I suspect it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;let me pay the difference&quot;).<p>But in general capping malpractice payouts has done nothing to offset malpractice coverage costs, let alone flow-through to end consumer costs.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39531243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39531243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rainsford</span><span>|</span><a href="#39530928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39531143">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39531019">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39531243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39531243">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That kind of extractive, anti-consumer business model would be worth going after in any industry, but it feels especially bad in health care.

Then, a number of years later, the same child had her appendix removed. Again, terrifying bills, and about $3500 out of pocket.<p>That being said, after the second event, we had discharge orders from the surgeon that included very specific conditions for when we should bring her in. When some of those conditions presented, we brought her to her (in network) primary care physician, whose office is (incidentally) in our in-network hospital. The physician agreed with our having brought her in, and recommended a CT scan. My daughter was sent down the hall from her in-network pediatrician to the in-network emergency room where the CT machine was located. CT scan proceeded, findings were good, and my daughter recovered just fine.<p>So imagine my surprise when I get a bill for the CT scan. After many phone calls, emails, registered letters, etc. the final determination was that the ER was, at the time of the events in question, had been staffed by an out-of-network third party and thus would not be covered.<p>Now in the scheme of things, the CT scan was a drop in the bucket compared to everything that <i>was</i> covered, and I&#x27;m very thankful for how things worked out. But the principal of that situation really left a bad taste in my mouth. We had no reason to suspect that the CT scan wouldn&#x27;t be covered, and were in no way advised as such.

There are hereditary conditions, and accidents and chronic conditions - I know. I work in the industry.<p>However, as a nation we&#x27;ve largely chosen to outsource our health.<p>It makes sense, in a world that operates around specialization, we tend to follow those patterns for everything. Electrical problem? Call electrician. Plumbing problem? Call plumber. Health problem? See a doctor.<p>It&#x27;s understandable, but it&#x27;s reactive and not an optimal solution for wellness.<p>Consider these leading areas of healthcare costs in the U.S.:<p>Obesity: 173 billion per year. [1]<p>Diabetes: 412 billion per year. [2]<p>Heart disease &amp; stroke: 216 billion per year. [1]<p>Smoking: 240 billion per year. [3]<p>And alcohol just makes all of that way worse. [4]<p>Most of the above can be controlled.<p>If we really want to reduce costs and improve healthcare, I think it&#x27;s best to start at home and work towards making sure we and our families are healthy and fit. It&#x27;s not easy, and it takes a lot of education and work, but it&#x27;s worth the effort.<p>If Americans did that, we could reduce healthcare spend and ease the burden of stressed medical systems. We&#x27;d all be healthier and happier.<p>It&#x27;s not the whole answer, but it would be a great start.<p>The path we&#x27;re on seems to be trending in the opposite direction. Processed foods, sedentary lifestyle, addictive additives, high stress jobs - it all adds up.<p>I think rising healthcare costs are (amongst other things) a symptom of our choice to deprioritize our wellness.<p>Sure there are lots of opportunities for disintermediation in the gordian knot of U.S. healthcare, and we should pursue good solutions.<p>But we should start with what we can directly control: our diet and fitness.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;chronicdisease&#x2F;about&#x2F;costs&#x2F;index.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;chronicdisease&#x2F;about&#x2F;costs&#x2F;index.htm</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diabetes.org&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;new-american-diabetes-association-report-finds-annual-costs-diabetes-be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diabetes.org&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;new-american-di...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;tobacco&#x2F;data_statistics&#x2F;fact_sheets&#x2F;fast_facts&#x2F;cost-and-expenditures.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;tobacco&#x2F;data_statistics&#x2F;fact_sheets&#x2F;fast...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S2773065422000347" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S277306542...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39531476" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39531476" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dandigangi</span><span>|</span><a href="#39534478">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39531948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39531476">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39531476">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do Discover&#x2F;Capital One next.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39531948" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39531948" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voakbasda</span><span>|</span><a href="#39531476">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39530881">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39531948">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39531948">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">UnitedHealth is by far the worst health coverage I have ever had.

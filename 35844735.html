I was never really &quot;abused,&quot; but I grew up always feeling more connected with people who have divorced parents or with an absent father. Mine was right there, he drove me to soccer, how could I listen to Everclear and Linkin Park and feel emotionally attached to it? I was the model of middle America. As I grew older I always felt closer to &quot;outcasts&quot; and misfits. My general feeling of disconnected-ness and being different followed me wherever I went. I always felt different. I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I never understood why.<p>After reading online about what a great book <i>Running on Empty: Overcoming your childhood emotional neglect</i> was, while also feeling like I was running on empty, I decided to read the book. It felt like a biography. It made <i>so much</i> make sense and helped me understand why I&#x27;ve had the feelings I&#x27;ve had most of my life.<p>Abuse almost always comes with emotional neglect. As time moves forward I imagine most physical wounds heal, but the emotional ones are the wounds that don&#x27;t heal so easily.<p>Here is the authors website with a relatively short read and I think anyone resonating with this HN article will probably feel &quot;seen&quot; by it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drjonicewebb.com&#x2F;the-painful-secret-many-people-live-with-the-fatal-flaw&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drjonicewebb.com&#x2F;the-painful-secret-many-people-live...</a></div><br/><div id="35848847" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35848847" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdkoeck</span><span>|</span><a href="#35848272">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35845917">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35848847">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35848847">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hi, I don’t know you and I may be completely wrong, but consider that, rather than OR on top of being emotionally neglected, your may have a personality with high neuroticism that facilitates “fatal flaw” thinking.

After a while you stop sharing completely.<p>Separating their behavior from who they are as a person is the hardest thing I&#x27;ve had to do. But it&#x27;s the first milestone in rebuilding a relationship and helped me seperate myself from their behavior. Being aware that their behavior is a consequence of their upbringing earned empathy from me, but I think forgiveness requires empathy in both directions. I think it&#x27;s equally hard to accept that you hurt someone you love.<p>Cultural norms can cause a lot of people to stay quiet, even if they decided to cut all contact, because talking poorly about your parents is seen as one of the worst things you can do.

For me, I barely remember stuff that happened even a decade ago, much less when I was a child. The mortifying memories probably stick longer than the pleasant ones do, but ultimately they all fade. It used to bother me, especally when sharing with partners who found it a reason to pity me, and for a period I wondered if I actually had some kind of trauma that I was hiding from myself. But eventually I stopped caring, because worrying about holes in your memory is just wasting time you could have spent thinking about things that are productive or entertaining or actionable in the present. I have come to think that my mind just works a bit differently to the folks who are more focused on their past. For me, now, I accept that if something no longer appears useful, it gets garbage-collected. Doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t worth experiencing in the first place, just means I acknowledge it was a fleeting moment of joy (or pain) and that&#x27;s fine.

Yes, kids with issues end up being abused more often, but you do not even describe yourself having adhd or autism or some other hard issue.<p>-------------------<p>When I became parent, I became less tolerant of these &quot;maybe the kid was just too hard&quot;. Because, I realized that decision between abuse or not is fairly often conscious choice. Adults say hurtful things to manipulate kids into what they want or to vent their emotions. They know full well what they are doing, they just think they are entitled to do it. Or they genuinely think that the kid is not entitled better treatment and deserves it.<p>It is not always inability to do otherwise in technical sense. It is unwillingness to do so and sense that it is just to hurt the kid.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35846433" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35846433" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thenerdhead</span><span>|</span><a href="#35846436">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35846258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35846433">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35846433">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They fuck you up, your mum and dad.<p>They may not mean to, but they do.<p>They fill you with the faults they had<p>And add some extra, just for you.<p>-Philip Larkin, This Be The Verse</div><br/><div id="35846530" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35846530" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">revolvingocelot</span><span>|</span><a href="#35846433">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35846495">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35846530">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35846530">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Given the sibling comment, I feel the parent needs some explanation, and the full poem!

As someone who hasn&#x27;t dealt with physical abuse, not only would be it difficult to know how to help a close friend through those feelings, but there&#x27;s a good chance I&#x27;d actively guide them <i>away</i> from confronting them. &quot;You&#x27;re nothing like him,&quot; or, &quot;but you were just defending your sister,&quot; etc. I don&#x27;t want a friend to feel those things!

Please help me remember that this is not my fault, and that I don&#x27;t need to feel shame in seeking help.&quot;<p>If there&#x27;s nobody else, tell us your location.  Someone here will probably be around, and willing to go with you, if you&#x27;re willing to accept help in that way.<p>Please, please, please.  Find a way to get help.  You&#x27;re worth more than this.<p>[1] Yes, I remember the author&#x27;s username.

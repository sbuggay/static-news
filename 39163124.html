We used to have lunch with interns from HP and other companies and visited Xerox PARC, it was like visiting Shangri La!<p>When I first visited the US in 1992 I visited the Silicon Graphics buildings where the person who hosted me worked, it felt infinitely innovative. In 2000 they (now SGI) had built these cool buildings (which is now the Google campus) and offered free dinner for employees and families on Tuesday evenings. You don&#x27;t get to hear about them much.<p>In 1993 we had a brand new Silicon Graphics Indy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SGI_Indy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SGI_Indy</a>) in our lab and <i>loved</i> it, so different from the beige boxes. Somebody ripped the first three songs from the Eurythmics Greatest Hits CD and had them playing on a loop into late nights when we were working on our Wavelets course projects (we had Daubechies&#x27;s <i>Ten Lectures on Wavelets</i> as the textbook).<p>Good times!</div><br/><div id="39173943" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39173943" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Taniwha</span><span>|</span><a href="#39172484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39172784">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39173943">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39173943">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the address they have for the original Frys (where I bought chips in the mid &#x27;80s on a Sunday) is wrong - they were originally on the corner of Lawrence and Oakmead Pkwy</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39172784" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39172784" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ccamrobertson</span><span>|</span><a href="#39172484">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39173101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39172784">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39172784">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">We rented the Byte Shop building as an office from 2013-2016.<p>After the Byte Shop left the space, it became what Steve Jobs affectionately referred to as an &quot;adult bookstore&quot; for the next thirty or so years until we leased it for a massive discount; the landlords had forgotten the history and could not fathom why anyone would want the space given its most recent sordid occupant.<p>We kept an Apple &#x2F;&#x2F; in the window and even hosted an open house.

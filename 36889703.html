Since then, the company&#x27;s fiscal year-end results came out. Despite growing revenue, it lost $84 million over the year ending on March 31, 2023.<p>Thank god Wikipedia isn’t run like Stack Overflow. As an end user, they have pretty much the same value proposition: user generated answers to my questions. Wikipedia is still doing well, meanwhile it seems SO is constantly being driven off a cliff by bimbos in management.<p>Not everything needs to be a damn unicorn. SO is an information repository. They need to accept that stop trying to “enhance” it with more crap because they don’t realize their median user is a junior dev who really just needs to serialize a Java object and isn’t going to pay or put up with any LLM-generated nonsense.<p>SO doesn’t need large language models. What they really need is a better model of what answers are good, what answers are outdated, and what answers should be expanded to include more info (and sometimes, what answers should be slimmed down a bit). Turn the top answer to popular questions into a wiki so that everyone can update it. And then add backlinks for questions which were closed for being “duplicates”. It solves so many problems SO has.<p>Another thing. This “comments aren’t for extended discussion” nonsense needs to go too. Any question could easily include a Reddit-style discussion tab to facilitate discussion. I’m sure much of it would be at least as valuable as the answers themselves.</div><br/><div id="36890812" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36890812" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nolok</span><span>|</span><a href="#36890672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36890729">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36890812">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36890812">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">While I mostly agree with your point, I want to point out that on a financial level Wikipedia is really not that well handled.

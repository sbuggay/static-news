Email me if interested.).<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not nearly as pessimistic about it. Zoom out for a sec and generalize to SaaS in general, not just AI infra (a subset of Saas) - all the arguments listed apply there too, except the data moat (which honestly doesn&#x27;t matter to tons and tons of AI infra companies. That&#x27;s more of an AI application problem). Now of course most startups are doing AI at least a bit, but in the past decade we&#x27;ve seen plenty of SaaS vendors compete with incumbents either head on or by carving out their own niche. In fact, two of the companies the author considers &quot;incumbents&quot; are arguably still challengers, but definitely were in this exact situation just a few years ago: Vercel and Databricks.<p>Also, competition from incumbents is hardly a deathknell. There&#x27;s room for multiple products in some market segments - how many RDBMS companies are there? Competition from a huge incumbent in many ways comes with benefits, because it helps grow the overall market and awareness of the product space, including your own product.<p>I suppose according to this author I&#x27;m in the &quot;application layer&quot; even though really I&#x27;m in the AI-application-layer-now-but-not-later-layer, software-infrastructure-layer. And that&#x27;s great because I actually do have experience in that specific application area. But honestly, saying &quot;you ought to have expertise in your domain&quot; is 1) duh 2) in the examples (llamaindex parsing&#x2F;ocr, langchain llmops + agnetic stuff), there is clearly a big enough twist on doing it &quot;but with AI&quot; that the application&#x2F;vertical is close to novel. Successful challengers create valuable businesses without prior deep expertise in their domain all the time and I don&#x27;t really see how this is any different.<p>Basically, you could repeat this for any SaaS business. Starting a company is hard, but I don&#x27;t know if AI infra is uniquely hard in the ways laid out.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40864000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40864000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Simon_ORourke</span><span>|</span><a href="#40863683">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40863315">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40864000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40864000">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve come across a number of these AI infra start-ups like Scale AI and Zerve and TBH I&#x27;m amazed they can do what they do with relatively small teams when you have Meta and Apple somewhat struggling in this area and buying rather than building themselves.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40863315" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40863315" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pierre</span><span>|</span><a href="#40864000">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40863386">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40863315">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40863315">[17 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Good article, but what is the alternative?

In the city of Copenhagen there was a project to digitalise a few million case files (which is 10-100 documents per case file), and how it was done was basically with an intermediary company who knew the training and a cooperation with Microsoft. Yes, I’m dumping down the complexity of it all, but once the training period of half a year was over, Azure made a lot (and I mean a lot) of infrastructure available for not a lot of money and the process completed in a week or so. Since it had to happen and because it was a PoC the same project was also done by real humans. This was the “actual” project and every time deadline and whatnot the AI project had came from how long it would take X humans to do it. I can’t recall how many X was, but it was enough to meet the legal deadline for when these case files had to be digitised and sorted correctly.<p>The human project was the result, and then the AI PoC was later used as a lesson on whether it could be done this way or not. It can, it was more accurate and not more expensive.<p>Anyway… I’m not sure who would’ve been capable of competing with Azure. (Outside the usual suspects). Maybe a company of Hetzner could? But you would need someone who can offer you a massive amount of computing on demand, and the only companies which are going to have that are big vendors.<p>Maybe it’s different with LLMs because the requirement is a continuous thing rather than something you need for a short period of time?</div><br/><div id="40863646" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40863646" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jononor</span><span>|</span><a href="#40863386">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40863495">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40863527">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40863646">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40863646">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Assuming: 50 million files, assuming 4x concurrency per CPU, taking 1 second each, would take approx 150 CPU days.

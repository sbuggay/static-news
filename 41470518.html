For instance, if true, such unification likely means that the proton should be an unstable particle that very slowly decays, and that has never been observed experimentally.<p>Unifying such a “grand unified theory” with gravity (general relativity) is however a much harder problem: While all the other forces are already understood in terms of quantum mechanics, gravity is currently understood in terms of <i>geometry</i>, and it’s not obvious how to combine those in a sane way. That’s where string theory, quantum loop gravity, etc, come in; but AFAIK, most prospective theories are very far from even experimental predictions, let alone experimental testing, and not everyone even agrees on the premise that gravity “should” be described using quantum field theory.<p>We just know that our current theories can’t be complete, since thought experiments like “what is gravity during a quantum double slit experiment” or “what really happens near and inside a black hole” can’t be answered in a fully satisfactory way using current theories.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41478112" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41478112" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lanstin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41478808">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41471111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41478112">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41478112">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the most impressive early results on the path the the full classification (in terms of being able to understand the statement of the result, if not the 250 pages of the proof) is that all non-Abelian groups of odd order are not simple. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="41471111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41471111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">card_zero</span><span>|</span><a href="#41478112">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41477437">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41471111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41471111">[20 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This starts out as one of those &quot;how they came up with a part of mathematics&quot; stories, or explanations.

For groups, this played out in how Cayley defined the abstract group in the 1850s, but it only started to gain more widespread usage in the 1870s. As for what they were doing, the main areas ways appeared around this time were through permutation groups (roots of polynomials), abelian groups (various number theoretic constructions&#x2F;statements), and geometry (study geometry by studying groups of transformations, like isometries for Euclidean geometry).</div><br/></div></div><div id="41471798" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41471798" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">082349872349872</span><span>|</span><a href="#41471111">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41478146">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41477301">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41471798">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41471798">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_group_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_group_theory</a><p>&gt; <i>flipping a triangle around.

And of course it&#x27;s all built on NAND.<p>And another teaser:<p><pre><code>  In the Principia Mathematica, Whitehead and Russell proved the following theorem, which Leibniz called the Praeclarum Theorema (Splendid Theorem). It is one of the last and most complex theorems in propositional logic in the Principia, and the proof required a total of 43 steps ... With Peirce’s rules, this theorem can be proved in just seven steps starting with a blank sheet of paper.

Two states that arise from each other, either by a virtual rotation of the system of electrons or by one of their permutations, are connected by a linear transformation associated with that rotation or that permutation. Hence *the profoundest and most systematic part of group theory*, the theory of representations of a group by linear transformations, comes into play here. I must refrain from giving you a more precise account of this difficult subject. But here symmetry once more has proved the clue to a field of great variety and importance.<p>&gt; From art, from biology, from crystallography and physics I finally turn to <i>mathematics</i>, which I must include all the more because the essential concepts, *especially that of a group*, were first developed from their applications in mathematics.<p>- Hermann Weyl&#x27;s <i>Symmetry</i>, p. 135</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41477437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41477437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelseyfrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#41471111">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41477437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41477437">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not just groups, magmas, semigroups, monoids, &amp;c.<p>I acquired a taste for algebraic structures and category theory by way of Scala+cats.

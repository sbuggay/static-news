It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to get over the pond, but with a shipment-forwarding company + a UK App Store account you can get up and running.<p>I&#x27;ve dabbled a bit with it and it&#x27;s very close to the cuff measurements.<p>It works by calibrating with their custom arm cuff device. I&#x27;d guess that it&#x27;s correlating what the wrist sensor sees w.r.t. your wrist blood vessels and what the &quot;true&quot; reading is from your arm. You re-do the calibration every few weeks.<p>The device takes a reading every 20 or 30 minutes or so and seems to try to pick periods where you&#x27;re more stationary.<p>However, one thing to be aware of is that you are not used to seeing your BP readings from the entire day. Did you jump in a cold plunge 10 minutes before it ran? Get ready to see a really high reading dot in the &#x27;danger zone&#x27;. Went for a jog and are catching your breath on a park bench? High dot.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, it just takes some getting used to since your &quot;daily average&quot; will be significantly above the readings you&#x27;re used to if you&#x27;re doing arm cuff measurements at the start&#x2F;end of the day. Of course it&#x27;s also getting readings at those more usual times too, but they get washed out in the larger number of data points from your day.<p>And goes without saying, your blood pressure SHOULD go up and down based on your activity and time of day. You just aren&#x27;t used to seeing it other than at true rest.<p>But all in all it&#x27;s been fascinating to see, and there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that this technology will be mainstream quickly (and Apple will likely dominate it).</div><br/><div id="41800950" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41800950" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwup238</span><span>|</span><a href="#41800122">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41800558">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41800950">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41800950">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; However, one thing to be aware of is that you are not used to seeing your BP readings from the entire day.</i><p>Same thing with those continuous glucose monitors that almost anyone can get and put on their arm now.

I also use Samsung Galaxy Watch (Active2) and find it to work well for me. I&#x27;m surprised more people don&#x27;t know about it. I know couple of people that suffer from high BP. They showed little interest when I told them about the watch.<p>Regular external calibration helped me build confidence. I was suspicions if the watch worked, and how well it worked. Calibration is every month - it expires. I take 3 measurements in parallel watch-cuff, and tell the watch App what the cuff measured. I didn&#x27;t mind it initially. I now find it annoying tbh. I see why Apple would like to get rid of it. Post calibration, I measure 3 times in parallel both watch and cuff to check if they match. If the difference is within 5% - then fine. In 3 years it&#x27;s happened twice where they differed more and I had to recalibrate. From recollection - both times with a reason, a TV was turned on in living room.<p>I have the impression that BP measurements differ though the day (lower in the morning, higher in the evening), depending on activity or at rest of course, I think there maybe some seasonality too (winter v.s. summer). Measuring BP when going to the doctor once a year strikes me as a wholly inadequate. If the BP is absurdly high out of normal range - then yeah, we learn something is wrong with the patient. But in any other case - don&#x27;t see what can be deduced from 1 random measurement.<p>To check if the calibration is important, I had my wife use the watch, that is calibrated on me. She got absurd readings. So yes - the calibration is important and is tied to the person that did the calibration.

So does lowering blood pressure reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, etc, but nevertheless shorten your lifespan in other ways because of a higher heart rate?<p>[1] I&#x27;ve verified this for myself with careful record keeping over long periods of starting&#x2F;stopping different BP meds, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s true for everyone.</div><br/><div id="41801485" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41801485" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brandonb</span><span>|</span><a href="#41801259">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41801416">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41801485">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41801485">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This sounds like reflex tachycardia -- your body wants to ensure blood is flowing to all the right places, so it raises heart rate to partially compensate for blood pressure falling. Reflex tachycardia can be a normal response to certain types of blood pressure medications, like vasodilators or diuretics. Beta blockers are a different common type of blood pressure medication that attempt to lower both blood pressure and heart rate simultaneously.<p>If the increase in heart rate is large (&gt;30bpm), especially when going from laying to standing, it could be a sign of underlying dysautonomia or POTS. If you experience symptoms (dizziness, fatigue, fainting, etc) it&#x27;s worth getting evaluated.

I hope we get there as it will be hugely important. However, remember tech is only a small part of the battle. We need to figure out clinically what to do with all this new continuous data.<p>I am very sceptical PPG alone will be capable for many reasons. Aktiia does indeed have European regs clearance. But, they don&#x27;t have FDA clearance. The FDA is a very different beast (more hands on - and they&#x27;ll be absolutely much more heavy with such a new approach) - and they must have concerns on the approach for it to take this long. The FDA even has accelerated programmes for breakthrough high impact tech as they really do want it to get to market safely.<p>The main cuffless FDA cleared devices I know measure the pulse transit time betwen a central ECG patch and a peripheral based PPG (that time is then calibrated to a BP with the Moens Kourteweg equation) - see Biobeats watch and a now defunct wearable ICU monitor company I can&#x27;t find the name of.<p>The issue with PPG is that it is wildly sensitive. The PPG waveform morphology will changed dramatically based on the pressure of the sensor against the skin, unconstrained changes in orientation of the human and arm etc. Changes in morphology != changes in system wide BP.<p>Speak to an anaesthesiologist and they&#x27;ll tell you blood pressure is function many things eg cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, blood volume, total peripheral resistance etc etc (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharinginhealth.ca&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;images&#x2F;blood_pressure.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sharinginhealth.ca&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;images&#x2F;blood_press...</a>). The question is whether PPG alone can measure all these things. I suspect it&#x27;s really just measuring lots of proxies of all these things. And that&#x27;s fine - however in the presence of people with conditions or on therapeutics that alter these in very personalised and unpredictable ways then error may start to creep in on free living measurement. Paradoxically, it&#x27;s probably these people for whom this tech would have most impact - not the worried well.</div><br/><div id="41801477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41801477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saltcured</span><span>|</span><a href="#41800416">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41800468">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41801477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41801477">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder if you&#x27;ve heard of the Resonance Sonomanometry method claimed by Esperto Medical <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esperto.health&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esperto.health&#x2F;</a> and how you think this compares to others.<p>It seems like it might be an ultrasonic method?

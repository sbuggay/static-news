When I grew up, my father worked in commercial banking in the 1980s and 1990s.  There were so many bankruptcies &#x2F; mergers &#x2F; financial crises, that he got (painfully) used to being laid off.  Watching him go through this had a large impact on my view of my relationship with most employers (hostile, wary, defensive).  He once said to me, &quot;At my level (middle manager), as soon as I start my new job, I start looking for my next job.&quot;  He was exaggerating, but the point stayed with me.<p>I definitely agree with you: Looking for a job (or &quot;keeping your doors &amp; windows open to new opportunities&quot;) while having a job is much, much easier -- mentally.  In my industry, most connections with head hunters are made through LinkedIn.  You can set a special flag in your profile that says &quot;I&#x27;m looking for work&quot;, <i>but</i> this is only visible to professional head hunters (they pay a lot of money for an account with these special privileges).  It works very well.  Normally, the calls start with: &quot;Them: Are you looking at the moment?  Me: No, but I am open to new and exciting opportunities.  Them: Oh, great.  I have something for you.&quot;  Do that enough, and eventually something very good lands on your doorstep.</div><br/><div id="42632087" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42632087" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#42628127">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42631585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42628406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42632087">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42632087">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; At my level (middle manager), as soon as I start my new job, I start looking for my next job.&quot; He was exaggerating, but the point stayed with me.<p>That’s no exaggeration at all.

It is also good practice to always have a panel, not just the hiring manager, doing interviews.<p>So the candidate gets feedback along the lines of: &quot;Thank you for participating in our interview process. Unfortunately, our panel decided you weren&#x27;t the best fit for position X at this time, because ...reasons.... Under company policy, we won&#x27;t accept further applications from you for one year from today, but we would encourage you to apply for a role with us in the future&quot;.<p>There is a chance they will reply back to HR arguing, but it is their job to be polite but firm that the decision is already made, and that they can apply again in one year (and not pass anything back to the hiring manager).<p>The key is to think long term and about the company as a whole - the candidate who gets helpful feedback and is treated fairly is more likely to apply again in the future (after the mandatory cooling off period), when they might have more skills and experience working somewhere else. There is a finite qualified labour pool no matter where you are based, and having the good will even of rejected candidates is a competitive advantage. The message should be &quot;not now&quot;, rather than &quot;not ever&quot; (although of course, if they do go on some kind of rampage, they could turn the not now into not ever - that&#x27;s a bridge burning move). If a tiny percentage go on a rampage, but the company protects the individuals from it, and has lots of counteracting positive sentiment from prospective and actual staff, then it&#x27;s still a net positive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42629694" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42629694" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vrosas</span><span>|</span><a href="#42628922">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42629350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42632120">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42631694">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42629694">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42629694">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I once interviewed for a job where they admitted I was the only person in the pipeline.

Successful, high exposure companies were drowning in money and so they could just throw 100 engineers at each tiny problem and it wouldn&#x27;t materially affect their bottom line. They also didn&#x27;t care much whether an employee was doing their job efficiently, so long as they met basic objectives... Which wasn&#x27;t hard to do when you have so many people in the team and each person is responsible for a tiny piece.<p>Many people could be counter-productive in the long run, they were productive enough to meet their short-term OKRs and so they were left alone but their rushed work set the project up for long term pain... Often it&#x27;s impossible to trace back issues to specific individuals... In software development, it&#x27;s trivial to introduce massive technical debt while meeting or even blowing past short-term objectives. Someone who is literally killing the project might appear to be a top performer... They may be promoted before any problems become apparent... Kind of like a bad civil engineer who builds an amazing looking bridge and is celebrated for years until the bridge suddenly collapses because the foundations turned out to be poorly designed. By that point they&#x27;ve already been promoted several times, maybe already retired and they can claim that the collapse was caused by incorrect construction practices or bad maintenance work performed later. However, in software, it&#x27;s much worse because you can&#x27;t just point to a single incorrect formula or calculation. Failure is usually the result of many bad decisions.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42631654" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42631654" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ypeterholmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#42628197">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42628838">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42631654">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42631654">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Typo: &quot;Your pay your taxes into the system&quot;<p>Sorry to be this way.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42628838" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42628838" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coolThingsFirst</span><span>|</span><a href="#42631654">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42629469">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42628838">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42628838">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">u guys are getting interviews?

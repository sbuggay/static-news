Operator synthesis makes no logical sense. It became popular because we had the capability to do digital sound generation, but lacked the technology to do it in a comprehensible, systematic way. So the DX7 enjoyed huge popularity for a few years, before fading into obscurity.</i><p>That&#x27;s a weird take. I mean &quot;Operator synthesis makes no logical sense&quot;? He writes like FM went away.<p>While DX7 itself was eventually retired (and synths like M1 became popular), Yamaha made several further flagship FM synths, and FM synthesis is still widely popular, used in both plugin form (including several DX7 emulations plus lots of fresh FM implementations), modern dedicated FM synths (e.g. Korg Opsix, Elektron Digitone), and of course as FM sound engines in multi-engine synths (FM-X in Yamaha&#x27;s keyboards like Montage and MODX, Hydrasynth&#x27;s FM mode, Nord&#x27;s FM engine, to name but a few).

The hands-on UI of the Opsix turns what once was an ordeal of menu diving and incremental buttons into a much more rewarding, interactive experience.<p>I play one live in a band and use an old Yamaha KX76, the dedicated controller bigger brother to the DX7 as a controller for the Opsix.

The classic analog synth would have an envelope generator (&quot;ADSR&quot;) controlling the loudness of the tone, and another, most commonly, controlling the filter (the thing that makes the synth do a <i>wowowow</i> sound on the same note), but responsive fading and evolution of the harmonics wasn&#x27;t readily available.<p>On the Yamaha DX7, it was built into the core idea of FM synthesis.<p>You don&#x27;t know it when you hear it, you know it when you <i>play</i> it: the way the keyboard responded to the touch was <i>alive</i>, magical.<p>You didn&#x27;t need to rely on the modulation wheels and joysticks and knobs to vary the timbre as you play. You could simply <i>play the keyboard</i>.<p>On my Yamaha Reface DX (which overcomes the drawbacks of FM user interface), I can easily make a tone whose character (not loudness! - or not <i>just</i> loudness) changes when I simply play <i>harder</i>. It&#x27;s like having several instruments at once at your disposal, blending between them on the fly.<p>It&#x27;s that playability that makes FM make sense — and it was what other digital synthesis technologies went for, too. Roland&#x27;s &quot;linear arithmetic&quot;, vector synthesis, and M1&#x27;s multisampling all explored that area — but they came <i>after</i> DX7.<p>What makes FM synthesis unique is the heavily non-linear response of the tone to the dynamics. At worst, it&#x27;s unpredictable, but once you figure out where the sweet spots are in the parameter space, you get a tone like nothing else. A bell that&#x27;s also a string orchestra. A guitar with a soul of the saxophone, but not mistaken for either; an identity all of its own.<p>Yamaha DX7 heavily leaned into this aspect in instrument&#x27;s design, via providing additional parameters that controlled the sensitivity of operators to velocity depending on <i>where on the keyboard</i> you are, so that the lower tones would have a different character from higher ones.<p>The &quot;diminished brilliance&quot; the author writes about was likely that — i.e., the author not figuring out how FM sound design works, which they openly admitted. It was matter of taste of whoever made the presets; without programming those curves in, the higher notes can easily sound screeching.<p>The point, again, was that the instrument wasn&#x27;t merely responsive in a way that analogue synths couldn&#x27;t dream of, but that <i>the way in which it was responsive</i>, tone-wise, was programmable, and varied not just from patch to patch, but across the scale and velocity range.<p>Again, think about how plucking different strings on a guitar harder produces a <i>different variation</i> in tonal response. Each string has its own character.<p>This is the soul of the mathematical idea of FM synthesis: that the tone evolution should not merely be controlled by <i>time passing</i> (as it is on most analogue synths, via envelope generators and LFO&#x27;s), and not by knob twiddling (modulation wheels, knobs, sliders, joysticks,...) — but by <i>playing the instrument itself</i>.<p>And on a keyboard, what you really play with is <i>where</i> on the keyboard you strike a key, and <i>how fast</i>.<p>Yamaha DX7 allowed the player to vary the <i>timbre</i> by playing the instrument, with <i>both hands</i>, by having <i>all</i> tone generators depend on these two variables in a programmable, non-linear, <i>interesting</i> way.<p>FM synthesis of Yamaha DX7 therefore can&#x27;t be separated from the <i>physical keyboard</i> it shipped with. The way the tones <i>felt</i> as you played them were determined by the response curves which simply don&#x27;t map in the <i>same</i> way to a different keyboard.<p>The fact that the DX7 was a <i>digital</i> synth obscured the fact that it was a very <i>analog</i> instrument in that way; that to get a truly <i>good</i> FM preset, you need to <i>tune it to the keyboard response</i> (i.e. velocity curves), and that involves the analog components.<p>It&#x27;s also for this reason that DX7 only has membrane buttons, and no knobs or sliders. <i>It didn&#x27;t need them</i>. The 60 keys were your knobs and sliders, the means to control the tone.<p>That&#x27;s <i>why</i> the ePiano on the DX-7 was on 60% of the new releases. It didn&#x27;t merely <i>emulate</i> the Rhodes (which, by all means, wasn&#x27;t a rare instrument).<p>What it did was it gave keyboard players a way to play <i>with the tone</i> of their instrument <i>while playing the instrument</i>, something the Rhodes would have a more limited range for, as the variation in tone response was constrained by how similar the actual metallic forks that made the sound were to each other, and how similar the hammers are across the octaves — and the digital DX7 didn&#x27;t have that limitation.<p>It also gave the people used to playing the synth with one hand (to be able to tweak the sound with the other) the freedom to play truly polyphonically, and use the <i>keyboard itself</i> to control the tone dynamics.<p>Playing it was a liberating experience, and it <i>still</i> is, because while intricate multi-sampling can also give you that effect (at no less difficulty, mind you, even if you have the samples!), FM does it <i>differently</i>.<p>The musicians didn&#x27;t need to be mindful of all that; the absolute majority (Brian Eno expected) were outright oblivious to <i>why</i> and <i>what</i> made DX7 the instrument that you <i>had to</i> have.<p>You just <i>felt it</i>.<p>And yes, new FM synthesizers keep coming. Because emulating acoustic instruments is not just <i>easy</i> with sampling these days, it also <i>isn&#x27;t enough</i>. You can just hire someone to play the real instrument, after all.<p>You need a bit more than that to craft a distinctive sound — especially a <i>new</i> one.<p>Liven XFM, Korg Opsix, Arturia Minifreak all go boldly where manmade sound didn&#x27;t go before, and these are just three novel FM synthesizers from this decade.<p>Reface DX came out less than 10 years ago; and its FM engine is different from DX7 (as is the UX — you can finally change the tone <i>while playing it</i> with live controls).<p>And for all the talk of how FM is old, I&#x27;ve yet to see someone <i>not</i> be captivated by the ePiano patch that comes stock on the Reface DX when I let them play it when I bring the instrument around with me on trips (which I often do).<p>Current developments in the controllers (like what ROLI is doing) will allow all the existing sound generation techniques to shine in new ways, including FM.<p>But I think it&#x27;s the physical package of the keyboard, the algorithm, and <i>the presets tuned to the combination of the two</i> is what made the DX7 such a success.<p>A new FM instrument could easily be a hit with these factors, particularly if they don&#x27;t skimp on including built-in speakers <i>and making the presets sound great on them</i>. FM truly shines when <i>all</i> the pieces are aligned in a performer&#x27;s instrument.<p>Reface DX comes close to that point, but the presets it ships with are more of an engine demo than sounds to make music with, the speakers are not loud, and the mini-keys (which I love!) were a turn-off for many people — because in the Internet age, people would judge a machine <i>without actually playing it</i>, and that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> way to understand what&#x27;s so damn special about FM synthesis.<p>It&#x27;s the way you feel when you <i>play</i> it.<p>A sound demo simply won&#x27;t get that across.</div><br/><div id="42326308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42326308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">coldtea</span><span>|</span><a href="#42324164">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42326080">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42326308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42326308">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>the speakers are not loud</i><p>Well, let&#x27;s be clear: the speakers are just for noodling.<p>Nobody who performs would use the built-in speakers of such a keyboard, not even street performers.<p>- the only exception is the big-ass speakers in digital home pianos, and still those are only for home use.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42326080" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42326080" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tinco</span><span>|</span><a href="#42324164">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42326308">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325533">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42326080">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42326080">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Could you recommend a patch set for the reface?

art.<p>Think of a patch as a vector in the parameter space. For analogue
(subtractive&#x2F;linear model) synthesisers almost all of the space makes
some kind of sense. You get a usable sound even if it&#x27;s weird. With FM
(non-linear) synthesis a lot of the parameter space is completely
unusable and the great sounds are clustered in little islands around
which tiny changes in any parameters has wild effects - especially for
patches that use a feedback operator with high settings.<p>A good DX patch is a finely balanced creation. IIRC the sample rate is
60KHz and the oscillator control resolution is 14 bits, That doesn&#x27;t
give you as much control as with digital virtual synths today. Setting
up fine control of key-tracking and velocity is absolutely essential
to making the DX preformative.<p>Now one of the lovely things is how you can download literally tens of
thousands of DX7 patches, all the Yamaha cartridges and compilations
of peoples personal patch collections from the past 40 years.  But
because of the extreme sensitivity of the programming not all of them
work perfectly with the various emulator plugins and so they need
manual tweaking.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42325164" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42325164" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fuhsnn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42324164">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325628">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42325329">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42325164">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42325164">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;It&#x27;s also for this reason that DX7 only has membrane buttons, and no knobs or sliders.

What am I missing?</i><p>There <i>are</i> good keyboard controllers that you can plug into a Eurorack if you&#x27;re a Eurorack player. Many synths haverack mount versions. You&#x27;re missing nothing in that sense.<p>Your question isn&#x27;t about <i>the industry</i>. It&#x27;s about <i>musicians</i>. You&#x27;re asking why musicians <i>other than you</i> still want complete instruments.<p>The answer is simple. People who play other instruments need <i>other instruments</i>. Of which the keyboard can be an integral part.<p>You might as well ask why people still buy hardware synths when perfectly good software synthesizers exist.<p>The answer is the same: they play <i>differently</i> (that applies both to the machines and the performers).<p>Here are some reasons why synths come with built-in keyboards.<p>The most important reason:<p>— Keyboards are mechanical instruments with particular response curves. The patches the synth comes with can be optimized to <i>play and sound good</i> on the keyboard the synth ships with.<p>This guarantees quality out-of-the-box, consistency, and makes it so that your presets would <i>feel</i> the same when your play them on another device.<p>Yamaha DX-7 played with an 88 weighted keys keyboard is a different, and a <i>worse</i> instrument. As is a Clavinova played when DX-7 as a controller.<p>— Ergonomics matter. Each synthesizer is unique in the way it builds its sounds, which is why many come with dedicated controls (buttons, knobs, sliders, screens).<p><i>Where</i> these controls are in relation to the keyboard matters.<p>I can play drum pads <i>while playing the keys</i> on my Akai Mini Play 3, for example, but not on my larger Yamahas. I can tweak the patches on the Reface DX live, but not if I used the MX-88 as a controller.<p>— Physical layout matters. Performers to look the audience, not the knobs; the audience wants the performer to look at them.<p>Memorizing the layout by touch isn&#x27;t possible when the layout isn&#x27;t fixed.<p>For gigging musicians, the following are important:<p>— portability<p>— physical robustness<p>— time to set up on stage<p>— space on stage<p>— physical setup<p>— ability to move while performing<p>Having more cables to connect isn&#x27;t  something gigging musicians <i>want</i> when you have 5 minutes to set up for a 30 minute set at a dimly lit bar.<p>And then there&#x27;s the setup. You put a stand on a stage, there goes your controller. Where does the synth go? Oh, you need another table or stand for the synth.<p>Now to tweak a patch. Your controller may not have all the knobs your synth engine uses. The sound module has them, but it&#x27;s on the table <i>over there</i>, while you&#x27;re playing facing the audience <i>over here</i>. Bummer.<p>Finally, I have straps for some of my keyboards, so I can move around the stage during the show.<p>1&#x2F;4&quot; cables are long, and made to withstand abuse; USB plugs agent, and MIDI cables, while better, aren&#x27;t made for that either.<p>There are also marketing reasons:<p>— A synth that people can try in a store is more appealing than one they can&#x27;t. Rackmount synths don&#x27;t make for good displays.<p>If people have inconsistent experience trying the instrument, it doesn&#x27;t bode well for the brand.<p>— When someone plays a Nord keyboard, <i>you know it</i>, because it has a distinctive look. Musicians take note of other musicians&#x27; gear.<p>— An instrument that can&#x27;t make any sound on its own is not an <i>instrument</i>, it&#x27;s a <i>module</i>.<p>It&#x27;s a different product.<p>And then we get to psychological reasons:<p>— Performers are deeply attached to their <i>instruments</i>.<p>A sound module without a keyboard isn&#x27;t an instrument. A controller isn&#x27;t an instrument. Together, they form a <i>system</i> made up of <i>components</i>; it doesn&#x27;t feel as an instrument the same way a guitar does.<p>— Looks matter. Performers want to look <i>good</i> on stage. And a generic controller simply doesn&#x27;t <i>look</i> as good as a complete instrument, with a <i>dedicated</i> interface.<p>— <i>Feels</i> matter. The <i>feedback</i> one gets from <i>touching</i> and <i>playing</i> the instrument affects the performance.<p>And that&#x27;s before we get into things like:<p>— busking<p>— jamming with other people<p>— playing outdoors (I played my Reface DX in the mountains and at campfires, in the streets and on the road)<p>The TL;DR, though, is that if you want a controller for your Eurorack, you&#x27;ve got it.<p>Saying that&#x27;s how everyone <i>should</i> make music, though, is quite a reach.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42324736" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42324736" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fsckboy</span><span>|</span><a href="#42325461">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42323911">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42324736">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42324736">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;<i>They don&#x27;t make them like that any more: the Yamaha DX7 keyboard</i><p>Greg Kihn Band <i>Breakup Song</i> with the unforgettable lyric, &quot;they don&#x27;t write &#x27;em like that any more&quot; did not use the DX7 at least because it was not available in 1981, but the keyboardist Gary Philips was known to use Minimoog, Prophet-5, Wurlitzer, Rhodes and Yamaha pianos with the band.

My Club had lots of players&#x2F;parants that used WeChat and lots that used Facebook messenger. Some people barely used the Internet. Different clubs will have different mixes.<p>I ended up having a website with updates and a Facebook group. 1-to-1 Communication was done via SMS since everybody had that. I used to also do announcements on Club night, posters on the wall and a mass SMS at the start of each year to remind people we were starting up again.<p>A website for registering is not a trivial thing to setup and maintain. Even if you are just using a SaaS vendor it will still cost significant fees. Our Club charges $100&#x2F;year to cover everything. If you want something non-standard then who knows what that will cost.<p>I know that since I left some stuff does take place on discord and some registration is done automatically online (under the grace of a club member with time). But you have to pick your technology to match your members. If most of them a 50+ then a discord that only 10% use is only for discussion, not somewhere for official communication&#x2F;business.</div><br/><div id="37377200" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37377200" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">x0x0</span><span>|</span><a href="#37376670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37377382">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37377200">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37377200">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you do any volunteering you&#x27;ll meet people like this.

Master points donât necessarily mean anything. If you have a lot, it means youâve played a lot - maybe they at least mean that. You could play for 50 years and easily become a life master but be complete garbage compared to the kid who did it in a month or two. Thereâs no information to understand how successful you actually are minus what you alone know about yourself and your game. Itâs just not as fun, especially once I started to play games that make success extremely evident via stats &#x2F; ranking.<p>Bridge is very unique in needing a partner to play with and one that you understand quite well. I once played with one of the best players in the world as a 16 year old (literally, one of the âbestâ at least master point wise). We did terrible lol. I didnât know what he was doing and he couldnât stoop down to my level all too well. How do you find the right partner? Not really sure.

Except that it&#x27;s not cheating, because the other team also has a pretty good idea of what you have as well, because people follow the same systems. The author mentions alerts - this is when you have to explicitly call out the meaning of a bid if it&#x27;s not following the usual convention. Usually you do this as well as announcing what system you&#x27;re playing at the start whenever you get a new opponent pair. In his article, he gives examples like &quot;1&#x2F;2 GF&quot; and because that&#x27;s not a standard system for tournaments, if e.g. the opener played 1S and their partner replied with 2D, the opener has to alert the other team about the non-standard bid by saying &quot;game forcing&quot; immediately after their partner bids the 2D and before the opponent bids.<p>This is contrary to the normal rules that you&#x27;re not allowed to say ANYTHING other than a bid which is a number and a suit. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s surprising on the first page that people are getting upset when he&#x27;s asking them to be quiet. On the other hand, it&#x27;s quite common to have a friendly chat during the game as long as it&#x27;s obvious to everyone it has nothing to do with the game. However, that does obviously open up the possibility of secret information being passed as well as being distracting to the other team, so normally people respect the rules and only talk between games. If people are getting violent when being asked to be quiet during bidding, then they should definitely be told to leave by the organisers.<p>In terms of secret bidding, I have kind of mixed feelings about this. There are definitely opportunities for creating a very complicated bidding system, and over the years, that&#x27;s how the main systems evolved, but most tournaments require you to play with specific conventions so that both teams understand the bidding.<p>In general, revealing the rough balance of your hand to the opponents isn&#x27;t too big a deal, as if one team has a very strong hand, the other team obviously is in a much weaker position and there&#x27;s little they can do to stop a win. In desperate measures you might bid something knowing you can&#x27;t win, but might not lose too badly, in order to stop a massive win, but that&#x27;s not common. However, understanding the other team&#x27;s bidding lets you figure out the balance of cards in their hands, so you might be able to defend more strategically if you know they&#x27;re going for a risky slam.<p>The real advantage of non-standard bidding systems is being able to communicate intent between &quot;I have nothing and can&#x27;t support&quot;, &quot;with what you&#x27;ve got we can easily make game&quot; and &quot;with what you&#x27;ve got there&#x27;s a good chance of a slam&quot; as quickly as possible so that there&#x27;s plenty of bidding space left to explore the details of best suit fit &#x2F; NT, or to figure out that both teams are quite balanced and get out of the bidding while it&#x27;s still low.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37377995" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37377995" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rpigab</span><span>|</span><a href="#37376707">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37376942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37377995">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37377995">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">None of those issues exist in Klondike Solitaire!</div><br/></div></div><div id="37376942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37376942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fouc</span><span>|</span><a href="#37377995">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37377122">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37376942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37376942">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve always wanted to try bridge but have yet to do so.

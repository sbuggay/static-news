I had so many conversations with politicians and civil servants where these effects were in abundance. In each country I was representing a group that included the most eminent and experienced computer scientists in the country. Whenever we briefed someone for the first time, it would only take a minute or two to cover how without a voter-verified paper audit trail, no-one knew how to build a system that provided anonymity, verifiability, and resistance to voter coercion and vote selling. But it just never clicked, so many of them refused to believe that we couldn&#x27;t simply &quot;nerd harder&quot;. And of course, there was no shortage of charlatans who would tell them that <i>they</i> could solve it.<p>In Ireland, we put enough pressure on the politicians for them to create a cross-body commission to investigate. Because anyone could make detailed submissions, and because the commission treated these submissions like the clerks of the Supreme Court treat amicus briefs; it was pretty effective. The commission ended up pausing, and ultimately abandoning, the rollout. Ever since I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate any avenues to &quot;de-politicize&quot; a controversy and get it to that kind of body.</div><br/><div id="37386261" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37386261" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hakunin</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37386261">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37386261">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I gotta admit, perhaps a bit naive of me, that the concept of &quot;tech charlatans&quot; didn&#x27;t click for me until now. It&#x27;s true, they are out there, and I see it now. I mean, I know there are phone scammers, but they probably been there before tech. I know there are hackers writing viruses and exploits, but those are oftentimes talented people doing bad things. However, this comment, and a couple recent experiences really drove &quot;tech charlatans&quot; home.<p>One experience was a trip to a crypto conference. Many booths were making unsubstantiated, impossible claims. If you tried to ask how, they couldn&#x27;t answer. Like, someone would say they made transactions instantaneous, and when I asked how they solved the problems of unpredictable networks, they&#x27;d have no answer. It got pretty frustrating. I had to dig through a few claims like these only to be convinced that they&#x27;re selling snake oil.<p>Another (less recent) experience was looking through a spreadsheet of government approved innovation&#x2F;research grants. I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was reading. Many of the entries seemed to make absolutely no sense, purposefully using buzzwords to sound smart, but having no meaning when unpacked. Buzzword salads. These are funded projects. And to get more money on round 2, all the &quot;innovators&quot; had to do is show any activity, which is very easy to fake.<p>So yes, tech charlatans. I&#x27;m a bit on the old school side of tech, and this gives me cognitive dissonance. I&#x27;m used to thinking of software devs&#x2F;engineers as honest&#x2F;creative&#x2F;driven, but I guess this was always inevitable. Our field is very exploitable, because many people put their livelihood in tech, while knowing very little about it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37385690" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37385690" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hu3</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385544">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37386261">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37389296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37385690">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37385690">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You should go to Brazil and try your luck there:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;in-a-blow-to-e-voting-critics-brazil-suspends-use-of-all-paper-ballots&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;in-a-blow-to-e-v...</a><p>From what I gather they banned any paper trail verification.

The only cases where it becomes a matter of regulation are the cases where tech and politicians disagree.<p>For example: Remember the privacy discussion around COVID-19 exposure-tracking apps? If the exposure-tracking apps had been implemented in a naive way, they would have been incredibly invasive to privacy. But tech proactively figured out good solutions to the privacy questions, so it never became an issue. If some politician _had_ proposed regulation saying that exposure-tracking apps needed to protect privacy, then tech wouldn&#x27;t have pushed back, because that&#x27;s what they were already doing anyway. But because tech was already doing it, politicians didn&#x27;t propose the regulation.<p>So, because an issue never becomes a matter of regulation unless tech pushes back on it, it ends up looks like &quot;tech pushes back on all regulation&quot;.<p>Furthermore, in the cases where tech and politicians disagree, the politicians haven&#x27;t always been right. For example, GDPR cookie banners are a joke. California&#x27;s AB5 law is another example, as the original article mentioned.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; is a fair analogy. Tech companies aren&#x27;t always right, but it&#x27;s not as if they&#x27;re automatically opposed to all new policies; and when they do oppose politicians&#x27; proposed policies, it&#x27;s sometimes for good reasons.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37385942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37385942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fallingknife</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385425">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37387919">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37385942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37385942">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And for what proposed regulation of the tech industry was the pushback unwarranted?</div><br/><div id="37389443" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37389443" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">watwut</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385425">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37386254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37389443">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37389443">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Quite a lot of complains about GDPR were pure hysterics.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37386254" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37386254" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tadfisher</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385425">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385942">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37389443">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385600">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37386254">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37386254">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Apple&#x2F;Google marketplace rules are common-sense, and address legitimate concerns.

Deeply profitable companies will fight tooth and nail against these regulations even if they are full aware of the damage they are causing.  They will come up with as many convincing sounding reasons to say &quot;no&quot; as possible in the name of those immense profits they enjoy, and use techniques like expensive lobbying, sponsoring pseudoscientific studies, running ads, play up fears about economic damage or other negative outcomes of the policy, etc.  They try to make it sound like the second or third kinds of &quot;no&quot; in the article and paint it as a bad idea, or impossible to do, or anything else they can to prevent the regulation.  And if a certain individual at that company doesn&#x27;t want to fight for their unethical profit, they&#x27;ll be swiftly replaced with someone who will.<p>The obvious (non tech) example is something like the tobacco industry, which spent millions on manipulating public and policy opinion using misleading scientific sounding language or studies to prevent or delay regulation despite being fully aware of the many health detriments of smoking.  Public health has been significantly improved as a result of smoking reduction, restrictions on where you can smoke in public spaces, age restrictions, whatever.<p>I think there is a lot of this currently in companies profiting off social media, oil and gas, and selling user data.</div><br/><div id="37386096" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37386096" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AnthonyMouse</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385600">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385835">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37386096">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37386096">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Deeply profitable companies will fight tooth and nail against these regulations even if they are full aware of the damage they are causing.<p>Unfortunately this is also very similar to one of the most insidious forms of regulation -- the mildly inefficient requirement.

Security credentials that unlock the data would have to be retained by the platform provider, law enforcement agencies, or some other trusted third party. If law enforcement’s keys guaranteed access to everything, an attacker who gained access to these keys would enjoy the same privilege. Moreover, law enforcement’s stated need for rapid access to data would make it impractical to store keys offline or split keys among multiple keyholders, as security engineers would normally do with extremely high-value credentials. Recent attacks on the United States Government Office of Personnel Management (OPM) show how much harm can arise when many organizations rely on a single institution that itself has security vulnerabilities. In the case of OPM, numerous federal agencies lost sensitive data because OPM had insecure infrastructure. If service providers implement exceptional access requirements incorrectly, the security of all of their users will be at risk.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37385746" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37385746" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tomComb</span><span>|</span><a href="#37385870">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37385746">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37385746">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The move away from globalization has had an unfortunate side effect: greater political corruption, where local politicians enact laws for the benefit of their local corporate buddies, and pretend (usually successfully) that it is an act of nationalism and standing up to big tech.<p>That’s what happened here in Canada with Bill c-18, as mentioned in the article.

A cryptographic end-user application is not &quot;mathematics&quot;. It&#x27;s a piece of software, running on a piece of hardware, and there is no platonic, infallible security going on. This is the sort of &#x27;no&#x27; people utter if they have ideological objections disguised as technological ones.<p>In reality any system, including cryptographic ones exist on a curve. Differentiated systems for access exist. The honest criticism would be that a system with a backdoor is less secure, but it&#x27;s certainly possible to enable privileged access to third parties while excluding others, it&#x27;s just riskier. But risk in reality also exists with any encrypted application, because it runs with keys stored on a phone, not in some untouchable maths dimension.<p>How much you move between access and security is absolutely a question of policy and architecture, not some theoretically impossible thing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37385695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37385695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">refulgentis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37386049">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37385652">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37385695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37385695">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is quite off-base, unfortunately.

Nobody thinks of stamp collecting as a problematic hobby. Collecting and curating is fun in its own right.<p>Though I do think there can be another aspect at play; I often find myself collecting things that I think &quot;might be useful&quot;. Eg: I have a ton of empty yogurt containers, for use in hypothetical future art projects. I <i>do</i> use them sometimes, but at this point I have plenty. I still feel the urge to keep saving them, though — for some imagined future. I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;I enjoy collecting yogurt containers,&quot; though.<p>I&#x27;m no hoarder, but I do feel a certain pull&#x2F;compulsion in that direction from time to time, and I could see the same being true elsewhere. It&#x27;s not always easy to know whether I&#x27;m scratching an itch or <i>worrying</i> at it.</div><br/><div id="38035973" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035973" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fluorescence</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035733">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38036078">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035973">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035973">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I am a bit disturbed by collecting hobbies to be honest. When there is some novelty, archival or scientific value to a collection, that is different and fascinating, it&#x27;s the purely consumerist collecting that gives me the heebie-jeebies.<p>It&#x27;s purely acquisitive and about the buying and getting and just seems quite sad and empty. Those afflicted become slaves to the companies pumping out items purely for this class of consumer. For example, &quot;limited editions&quot; and such are not rare because the product warrants it, it&#x27;s just designed scarcity to press the buttons of the collectors and extract the most money from them. Or it&#x27;s bidding wars on vintage items like wine where huge price inflation happens just for the collection kudos not the virtues of the item itself.<p>For example, I like fountain pens, but I can&#x27;t really read r&#x2F;fountainpens because it&#x27;s mostly people building huge collections of pens and getting excited about buying a new pattern or colour of pen they already own. Nothing makes me sadder than seeing their full collections of 100s of fantastic tools that will sit idle for the vast majority of their life until the owner passes and a relative has to liquidate things they don&#x27;t understand.<p>It looks like a dysfunction to me - a stimulation seeking addiction which is not satisfied by the next acquisition and will never fill the emptiness, the need, the dream, of the collector. I know people will be super defensive about their collecting but I would love for that money and energy to be redirected towards higher degrees of self-actualisation. It feels like a failure scale the Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs and get stuck in a loop down the bottom. Instead of creating novelty or growing, there is something safe, comfortable and unchallenging to just acquire.</div><br/><div id="38036029" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38036029" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mnky9800n</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035733">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035973">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38036041">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38036029">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38036029">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">what bothers me is not the people collecting them but the ones who offer such consumerist trash (e.g., funko pops).

But, on the show, when the hoarders talk about why they do it, it&#x27;s often a behavior that came about as a reaction to some kind of loss, or out of a <i>fear of</i> some kind of loss.  I would suggest that what you&#x27;ve described (&quot;I&#x27;ll hold on to this &#x27;just in case....&quot;) is a lot like the reasons they give for doing it, even if the real motivation is quite different.<p>There are differences as well.  Magnitude is the obvious one, unless you actually filled your entire kitchen with yogurt containers or something lol. :) The other big one I can think of is that an actual hoarder will have genuine, severe anxiety at the mere <i>thought</i> of getting rid of anything from their hoard.  This is another assumption, of course, but my guess is that if you had to get rid of some, or maybe even most of your accumulation of yogurt containers for some reason, you&#x27;d be able to do that, and the thought wouldn&#x27;t fill you with dread or anything.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38035840" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035840" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">minitoar</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035733">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38036078">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035967">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035840">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035840">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Haha yes, like so many behaviors, collecting yogurt containers to re-use is adaptive until it isn’t.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38035967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">j7ake</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035733">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035830">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035840">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035984">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ve gotten to the point of my book buying hobby that I buy books to collect books, rather than to read them.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38035984" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035984" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eternityforest</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035733">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035830">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035787">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035984">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035984">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">But first, one should ask if the hobby is actually fun without the imagined success(Even if the imagined success is just an excuse for the hobby!

There&#x27;s no wrong way to do it. Have a budget and do what makes you happy. If that&#x27;s accumulating gadgets, accumulate with joy. It&#x27;s not an illness.<p>Another reason for what the article calls Gear Acquisition Syndrome, if not for Gear Fabrication Syndrome, is the nature of the learning curve for some things. For example, I&#x27;m learning electronics, slowly. Slowly because I have children and a stressful full-time job. A while ago I bought an oscilloscope. I don&#x27;t really need an oscilloscope and it&#x27;s possible I never will. I&#x27;m just hooking up 555 timers and trying to get my head round the mysteries of inductance at this stage. The machine is occasionally marginally useful, but mostly I get it out for the sake of fiddling with it.<p>Does this mean I just bought it for the thrill of owning it? I certainly felt that thrill when it arrived, but I bought it to learn how to use it, as part of the larger project of &quot;learning electronics&quot;. My slow progress means it may be a long time before I&#x27;m doing things that really require it, but if and when that time comes I&#x27;ll be ready, with the device and the knowledge to use it correctly (and not blow it up! [1]). I don&#x27;t know how far I&#x27;ll get in learning and applying this stuff, but learning the tools is a major part of it, and rewarding in itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xaELqAo4kkQ?feature=shared" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;xaELqAo4kkQ?feature=shared</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38036036" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38036036" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crtified</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035982">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035727">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38036036">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38036036">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>looks guiltily at the ventilation system he&#x27;s building, to ventilate the workroom he&#x27;s made, to contain the jigs he&#x27;s constructed, to make the guitars he only needed one of, but has now somehow ordered enough wood for about 7</i><p>D&#x27;oh!!</div><br/></div></div><div id="38035727" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035727" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kleiba</span><span>|</span><a href="#38036036">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035863">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035727">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035727">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So, you&#x27;re not supposed to buy stuff for your hobby nor build stuff for your hobby?

Surely, people who call that their hobby like to play the (various different) games.

Built a simple sword just grinding the metal, then decided to study how to get a proper forge and whatnot. Studied a lot, learning the chemistry of steel, found where to buy the stuff. Never bought it, never made any forged item.<p>Then I decided to go for armor making, using rings. Started making one, got stuck because the rings were too rigid and I wasn&#x27;t strong enough... and that is it, it ended there.<p>So music then? Spent years learning how to compose music with a teacher that actually taught famous musicians, made my own cables to attach a keyboard to my computer, bought software, learned how to use trackers, became &quot;friends&quot; (as in... I don&#x27;t talk much to them, but when I do they actually listen and give me small favors) Siren (musician from Unreal series) and Virt (musician from a lot of newer indie games, like Shovel Knight). How much music I made? 0. People at the church asked me if I can play my keyboard in public while people sing hymns. I replied I actually, never tried that.<p>Dumped a ton of money in magic the gathering cards. Made a point when moving country, of bringing them with me, half of my airplane baggage limit was MTG cards. Last time I played? Several months ago, almost a year I suppose.<p>The list keeps going and it is driving me nuts, I feel like I am wasting my life. I am not studying hard enough to improve my job performance, I am not studying the bible as I should either, I keep promising myself I will do it and then I don&#x27;t. And again keeping with the theme of GAS, I actually spent a lot of money buying access to theology online classes and seminars, and didn&#x27;t watch any of it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38035761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LoganDark</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035948">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035703">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035761">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; A person’s insatiable urge to buy equipment for their art or hobby, distracting them from actually practicing said art or hobby.<p>[insert a string of like 100 sobbing emojis.]</div><br/></div></div><div id="38035703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ikekkdcjkfke</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035761">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035703">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s kinda related to bikeshedding, do anything else than pushing features</div><br/><div id="38035732" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035732" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ungamedplayer</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035703">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035732">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035732">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Like pushing fixes?</div><br/><div id="38035764" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035764" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LoganDark</span><span>|</span><a href="#38035703">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035732">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035764">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035764">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;583" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;583</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

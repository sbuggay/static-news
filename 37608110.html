Unfortunately, the CVE database(s) are too noisy to be useful. It could benefit from higher standards and more thorough vetting. (Maybe take some lessons from academia.)<p>A &quot;security researcher&quot; once filed a CVE for a regular bug in Caddy [0], making claims that were totally provably false. It was assigned 7.5... the same as <i>Heartbleed</i> [1] -- yes, the one that leaked almost all the private encryption keys on the Internet back in 2014. When I appealed to NVD for retraction (or whatever they do in this case), I never heard back, despite several emails &#x2F; form submissions. It is not well-maintained. It is poorly managed. There is virtually no oversight. NVD is a trainwreck.<p>More recently I inadvertently discovered a 0-day RCE in acme.sh [2]. (ACME clients are security-sensitive contexts since they typically deal with private keys and download signed credentials.) Anyway, it was assigned a CVSS 3.x score of * 9.8 * [3] -- I imagine that should be like &quot;cyber-nuclear meltdown&quot; territory, but no, this was actually benign as far as we can tell. Probably deserves more like a 4 or 5 or something. So, again: There is virtually no oversight. NVD is a trainwreck.<p>Anyway, the whole system is broken, and I&#x27;m effectively ignoring CVEs now. But if someone just tells me to patch my &lt;whatever&gt;, I&#x27;ll probably do it, and that&#x27;s good enough for me.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caddyserver&#x2F;caddy&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4775">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caddyserver&#x2F;caddy&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4775</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nvd.nist.gov&#x2F;vuln&#x2F;detail&#x2F;cve-2014-0160" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nvd.nist.gov&#x2F;vuln&#x2F;detail&#x2F;cve-2014-0160</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.life&#x2F;writing&#x2F;the-acme-protocol-in-practice-and-reality" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.life&#x2F;writing&#x2F;the-acme-protocol-in-practice-and-...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nvd.nist.gov&#x2F;vuln&#x2F;detail&#x2F;CVE-2023-38198" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nvd.nist.gov&#x2F;vuln&#x2F;detail&#x2F;CVE-2023-38198</a></div><br/><div id="37609645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37609645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ylk</span><span>|</span><a href="#37608432">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37608770">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37609645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37609645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">CVSS is not a measure for risk. I feel like it’s pretty hard to define an objective measure for “how much should you care about this” that applies to everyone, since you’d need to know how common the affected software is among all computers and how many of them are using the specific vulnerable configuration, etc.
What you can do instead is have a measure for “if this affects you, it’s pretty bad&#x2F;not that bad&#x2F;…”.<p>Heartbleed wasn’t an RCE, it just leaked sensitive data.

The CVSS numbers are a guide to which ones you should prioritise looking at, but not a risk assessment.<p>However, in the security and risk world, you have to take a worst case view in the absence of further reliable information. This can lead to fixing things that maybe don&#x27;t really need fixing, even when a triage has been done.

You use a regex at build time? Oh, apparently you are exposed to a ReDoS attack even though that regex isn’t available at runtime.<p>Or that time when Python disallowed string to int conversion of long strings because it is a DoS vulnerability. The lack of sanitisation led to DoS vulnerabilities in applications, but the conversion is obviously not a vulnerability in itself. Oh, and now those apps have DoS attack that just halts the application because the conversion throws ValueError.<p>It’s hard to say what the solution to that problem is. Oftentimes security vulnerabilities indeed don’t cause any problems alone and require a chain of other exploits to actually cause trouble. At the same time you don’t want to treat every function that runs in O(n^2) on input as a potential DoS attack. Distinguishing between a simple bug and a vulnerability requires contextual knowledge and expert judgement that simply cannot be built into bureaucratic organisations like MITRE.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37608368" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37608368" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mellosouls</span><span>|</span><a href="#37609333">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37608373">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37608368">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37608368">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The main example in the article was discussed recently:<p><i>CVE-2020-19909 is everything that is wrong with CVEs(74 comments)</i>

See 100% of CVEs filed against SAP, for example. All valid exploits, all work, all are used in the wild by ransomware, and all are still disputed by SAP.<p>- CVEs are free-form text, which makes even version strings uncomparable. Most projects down the line don&#x27;t &quot;sanitize to ASCII&quot; and don&#x27;t know about this. But there are many CVEs (~1%ish) with Chinese idiom symbols as a &quot;.&quot; character replacement. Nobody fixes that, ever.<p>- CVEs and their affected hardware&#x2F;software matching strings (CPEs) are utterly useless. They are an abstraction for the manual excel spreadsheet world, and literally every linux security tracker implements their own somewhat crappy parser to match against the real upstream projects, their package names and&#x2F;or the source code origins (e.g. a git repo link).<p>- CPEs are redundant. The linux kernel itself has more than 200 different CPE strings, and none of them are recorrected after they have been filed by the reporting person. What the actual duck. Have fun trying to find out if Arch Linux is affected when the initial CVE was filed against, say, SUSE or Oracle Linux.<p>- Most hardware vendors wait to confirm or deny anything until their hardware is EOL. Smart, right? Nobody knows so it must be secure, right? Looking at you, Cisco, Fortinet and the like. And now you are wondering why exploits from 2016 are still used and shared in Telegram channels of ransomware developers?<p>- There is no mandatory PoC in the CVE database. This could change so much in the ecosystem, especially with the hardforked still-patched feature frozen packages of distributions like Debian. Debian&#x27;s security tracker is littered with &quot;marked as fixed&quot; but actually &quot;can&#x27;t fix it because code diverged too much from upstream already&quot; CVEs. And guess what, those are exactly those exploits used in the wild by root&#x2F;bootkits.<p>- As the article author states, CVEs are never recorrected. This is the biggest issue of all of them. Nobody maintains a sane state of the database, even the new git repositories are buggy as hell and don&#x27;t validate against their own schema. Nobody fixes those CVEs &quot;upstream&quot; and nobody maintains old CVEs that turn out to affect more upstream projects. Prime example is log4j, because literally almost all java software is affected when they bundle(d) it; which almost all of them do. I complained to this but basically can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t be fixed [2], [3], [4] because even the new schemas are experimental (for over 8 years now).<p>Source: am scraping literally all linux security trackers to make a better CVE database for automatic comparison purposes.

It&#x27;s a simple change in terminology but we need to make sure to communicate that CVEs are just one, probably the most popular, but just one source of vulnerabilities.
Governance and security teams the world over need to learn this.<p>Next step ist to establish good tooling around publishing VEX statements (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange). That is currently not easy.<p>In the EU we currently have the discussions about the upcoming Cyber Resilience Act which has language in it that says products must be &quot;free of known vulnerabilities&quot; to be allowed to be placed on the European market. We&#x27;re trying to change that language but it ain&#x27;t trivial. The current best proposal is saying &quot;known _exploited_ vulnerabilities&quot;.
Otherwise I&#x27;d be able to DoS my competitors by publishing bogus vulnerabilities.<p>For that we have at least two sources: CISA KEV[1] (which just celebrated its thousands entry) and FIRST EPSS[2]. There might be more, these are the ones I&#x27;m aware of.<p>We are a software vendor and we want to do the best we can but at the moment it&#x27;s a box ticking exercise that&#x27;s not useful to anyone. We want to look at all vulnerabilities but we want to focus on the important ones. We need to be able to say &quot;our product is not affected by this vulnerability&quot; and we need our customers to trust us. Currently, they often trust the CVE&#x2F;NVD database more which is a huge problem because they are not experts in the specific products.<p>And especially for things like libraries you need to take the context into account in which it is used. Vulnerabilities are reported (using CPE, pURL etc.) at the &quot;library&quot; or &quot;application&quot; level but they really exist at a much more granular level (e.g. a single function is affected and if that&#x27;s not used there&#x27;s no problem).<p>I&#x27;m convinced that the whole space of vulnerability disclosure and management will change significantly over the next few years.<p>We happened to stumble into this and are now active in trying to shape the Cyber Resilience Act into a form that makes more sense because that will force basically every European company to now start this process. Other countries will follow (yes I know the US already has rules for some sectors but not everything, so do other countries).<p>[1] &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisa.gov&#x2F;known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisa.gov&#x2F;known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog</a>&gt;

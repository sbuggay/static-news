I used to fix things myself, but spending all my free time doing home repair was withdrawing from the limited bank account of my personal sanity. Having the house broken open for months while I picked away at it after work and on weekends was bad for morale, too. And doing the work myself was sometimes dispiriting rather than empowering—If someone else makes a mistake, even if I&#x27;m paying them, I can for whatever reason tolerate that with less frustration than when I screw up myself. Accepting that I am lucky enough to have a surplus of money that I can exchange for time and serenity was a big step for me. My conclusion was that cultivating a relationship with a good handyman is of as much value for me as any other long term service relationship: doctor, therapist, waitress, barista, etc. So, even though I&#x27;m not married and not having relationship angst <i>per se</i>, this article makes sense to me through that reinterpretation.</div><br/><div id="41227314" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41227314" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">segmondy</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227672">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41227314">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41227314">[40 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It does come down to mindset.

Having transformed some small plumbing things from easy to fix to really expensive to fix, I&#x27;m happy to know I live in a society with some degree of specialization. The plumber mightn&#x27;t know they need to have good error handling policies, but they use my company&#x27;s products, and we all go home happy. (This is also why I&#x27;m not in ops, except the odd heroic fire-fighting exercise; when I&#x27;m bored I like to change things to increase my knowledge of how it all works; I need worried and steady co-workers to keep things running).</div><br/><div id="41228867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41228867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">roughly</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41228649">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41228867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41228867">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If there was a physical &quot;undo&quot; button, I could get behind this philosophy<p>I had two reactions to this -<p>The first is that&#x27;s part of why I like working on low-stakes physical projects - especially when I&#x27;m working in my garden, I&#x27;m almost aggressively improvisational, just trying to use whatever&#x27;s on hand to do the job and fixing things as I go. Because the garden is mine and just an absolute hobby, I get to play around, and the feeling of satisfaction I get from cobbling something together to solve a problem easily matches delivering a carefully-done plan.<p>The second is that undo button makes us sloppy. I noticed this the first time I went into management - the hardest part of the job was I had no idea if I&#x27;d done something right and no way to do it again if I didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s made me sloppy a few other places as well, where I&#x27;ve found myself staring at something and thinking &quot;well shit, there&#x27;s no undo here, is there?&quot; I think spending some time with some things that have stakes and can&#x27;t be undone is healthy, and I think programming somehow makes us both sloppier and more risk-averse by its almost unbounded undo-ability.</div><br/><div id="41229269" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41229269" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lanstin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41228867">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227677">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41229269">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41229269">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Parenting was where I learned how to live with the lack of an undo.

When I a teenager, my family moved to a house that had 3 acres of grass.  At our previous house (1&#x2F;2 acre), we just had a standard push mower, and that was fine.  Now we had to buy a small tractor.  I remember being tasked to mow those 3 acres when my dad deemed me old enough, but he would always scold me if I did it too quickly, because he thought it wasn&#x27;t safe to run it at its top speed on our hilly yard, plus he believed the tractor cut poorly if you went to fast.<p>Overall it was just a huge waste of time and money for everyone involved.  At least the tractor had a plow attachment that was useful for clearing the driveway of snow in the winter, so it wasn&#x27;t a single-task purchase.  Then again, if we had a smaller plot of land, the driveway would have been short enough to handle with shovels, so...<p>As an adult, now we have a house out in a mountainous area where there&#x27;s snow on the ground for as long as 5 or 6 months out of the year.

I know I&#x27;m not great at woodworking, and honing those skills doesn&#x27;t really interest me all that much; someone else would do a much nicer job of it than I would.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to buy some more tools that I don&#x27;t really have good storage space for.  My compromise was to hire a handyman I trust to build the railing, but I decided I would stain it myself.</div><br/><div id="41230025" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41230025" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">analog31</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41229527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41229676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41230025">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41230025">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me, it also costs less than the 2 hours I have to spend contacting them, letting them into my house, deciding what I actually want (instead of just winging it), etc.<p>The tools keep costing less and less, as they&#x27;re used over and over for projects.

Later I lost another job and we had to short-sell our house.<p>We got a divorce and it wasn&#x27;t because of any of those things (though, they did influence it). It was because my default was to run away from my problems.<p>Funny thing; the divorce didn&#x27;t eliminate the stress.  It just moved it around in my body and mind and led to near constant anger, anxiety, and panic spasms.  I went to see a therapist who taught me to be present with what I&#x27;m feeling. (He practiced Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, for anyone interested) I did that in earnest and one day about six months after starting therapy I realized what a mistake I had made in giving up on my marriage.<p>I reached out and we were able to repair the relationship and we&#x27;ve been back together for over ten years now, thankfully.  We&#x27;re closer than ever.  I don&#x27;t recommend that particular method of repairing a relationship, by the way. ;)<p>It hasn&#x27;t always been easy since we got back together but, it has been worth it.

Now that we&#x27;ve been together for over twenty years (with a short &quot;We were on a break!&quot; in the middle) we find that the intensity of our love for each other isn&#x27;t the same but it is so much deeper than it was at the start and only grows more so the more we&#x27;re together.

It&#x27;s easy to say this the mindset of making things work doesn&#x27;t apply to abusive relationships - but it&#x27;s not always clear what abuse is. The very mindset that &#x27;divorce is not an option&#x27; means that people spend far too long in dangerous situations.<p>From my experience - I was married for 6 years to someone who, from the same starting position, moved to a very different philosophical viewpoint to me. This evolved over time, but by the end she&#x27;d happily tell me my belief system was wrong and immoral, and that she wanted she were married to someone who shared her viewpoint. She even said that in her opinion we shouldn&#x27;t be married, but that she didn&#x27;t believe in divorce. She&#x27;d never accept that there was anything wrong with what she was doing - she was simply trying to save me - and when I said &#x27;I find what you&#x27;re saying hurtful&#x27; she&#x27;d tell me she had no choice but to say it.<p>I can only imagine how miserable a time she was having, but she saw no choice but to continue in that relationship.<p>This never seemed like abuse at the time - and I&#x27;m certain she didn&#x27;t mean it as such - but with hindsight she broke down my confidence in myself and in who I was and left me fundamentally doubting whether I was a good person (among other things, like making relationships with friends and family difficult).<p>Of course, everyone&#x27;s experience is unique, but when I left that relationship I felt guilty, selfish and like I&#x27;d failed. It&#x27;s only with hindsight that I can say with confidence that it was the best thing for everyone involved, and I&#x27;m much happier and healthier some years and plenty of therapy later.

I have no doubt that the bathroom would have taken similarly long. We had a similar experience with people hired to replace our windows taking two years before the lawyers got involved. Both of these were on the medium-high prices because we got burned hiring a couple of cheap folks in the past. Joke&#x27;s on us.<p>Things they <i>both</i> did:<p>- Not measure things properly. How on earth a &quot;professional&quot; can be two-four inches off on several measurements I have no idea.<p>- Not check the order before ordering it (and waiting months for it to be made and come in).<p>- Not check the order before installing it.<p>- Conveniently losing digital and physical copies of contracts and communications. Too bad for them we kept the signed originals.<p>- When I mention that it&#x27;s clearly not right (prior to install) we get told something along the lines of &quot;that&#x27;s how they come from the factory, we fix it after installation&quot;. After install we get told &quot;of course we can&#x27;t fix that, you can accept it or wait another 6-8 months for new parts.&quot;<p>- A project manager that never actually supervises anything or shows up and has no problem lying to your face then saying something completely different in email afterwards.<p>- Contractor blaming manufacturer while manufacturer blames contractor. You have to take a day off work every time they come to inspect things <i>yet again</i>.<p>That&#x27;s not even mentioning the constant babysitting that needs to be done (I am no contractor but maybe connect the drain to the sink before it gets turned on?) And all the little things that you end up doing yourself anyway because at this point it&#x27;s just not worth it anymore like fixing all of the drywall they broke because I can do it in an afternoon and I am tired of talking to them and tired of seeing them and it will take you two weeks to come out anyway.<p>And we are not being picky here. It&#x27;s stuff that should have been immediately obvious. Like our kitchen cabinets not having windows (we cut the windows out after install, they said). Or being three different colors (we paint them afterwards, they said). After install I find that both of those are lies and they apparently ordered the wrong cabinets <i>and</i> put in some other customer&#x27;s cabinets on half my kitchen (one of the cabinets had over a dozen shims to make it fit properly). Three different materials (fiberboard, plywood, and solid wood). I didn&#x27;t even notice that one until after install.<p>What about the window that was inches too big, and you didn&#x27;t bother to check before ripping the old one out? Now I need to have plywood on my window for 8 months while you order a replacement. Good thing I&#x27;m not in an HOA or that would have got expensive quick. Maybe caulk the windows too? Just a suggestion but idk you&#x27;re the professional you probably know better than the manufacturer.<p>My partner, child, or myself getting cut <i>every</i> time we wipe the windows. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the manufacturers fault come send somebody to sand them down and clip off the sharp bits. It&#x27;s going to take 8 months for the new ones to come in. We&#x27;re tired of bleeding every time we clean.<p>Lastly if you have explosive diahrrea fucking clean the toilet afterwards, especially if it splashes all the way up the lid. You are disgusting and you do shit work. And the worst part is I never even mentioned the diahrrea to them because in the grand scheme of things it was absolutely minor.<p>Washing dishes in the winter outside with a hose fucking sucks. And washing dishes in the tiny bathroom sink sucks. Washing dishes in a tiny bathroom sink right after someone stunk it up <i>really</i> sucks.<p>At least if you do it yourself, you can take a long time and do a shot job, and take solace knowing that if you hired someone it would have been just as bad but taken longer and been more expensive.<p>&#x2F;rant. Sorry. The last few years have been stressful.<p>If you actually find someone that isn&#x27;t bad hold on to them tight. Find an owner&#x2F;operator who answers his own phone, does his own estimates, and does his own work.</div><br/><div id="41227740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41227740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextos</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41226970">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227533">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41227740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41227740">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That sucks. Personally, this is why I want to see prefabs take off, even if the price is actually more expensive. When you buy a car, it is quite rare to find major defects. In houses, defect lists are so common that Brits have a term for it, snagging lists. Prefabs should be quite close to cars in terms of quality as they are manufactured in a factory under controlled conditions. People I have met that bought prefabs from high-end manufacturers confirmed this, and had a more or less trouble-free experience.<p>In comparison, I have experienced major issues in <i>every</i> brand new house I have rented. I would not like to go through this experience as an actual owner as it would drive me insane. I have only met two contractors that were professional and took pride in their work. The rest were a bunch of wackos that only created chaos. In comparison, my experience leasing brand new cars could not be better. Get keys, drive for two years, return back. Zero issues. Given that a car is way more complex than a house, the construction industry seems terribly backwards.</div><br/><div id="41232088" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41232088" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shiroiushi</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227740">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227533">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41232088">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41232088">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Back in the 1970s, it was extremely common to buy a US-made brand-new car and have all kinds of major defects.  It didn&#x27;t matter that they were made in factories under &quot;controlled conditions&quot;: the factories were poorly run, and the products that came out were junk.  Dealers had large lots of cars that had just arrived from the factory and needed repairs before they could sell them.  It wasn&#x27;t until Japanese cars were imported in huge numbers, and had consistently high quality, that expectations changed.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t factory vs. non-factory, the problem is culture.  Many parts of American society have a culture of lying and cheating and making junk products and then lying to try to cover it up.  Just look at Boeing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41227533" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41227533" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SoftTalker</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41226970">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227740">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41227533">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41227533">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Far too many home improvement &quot;professionals&quot; are just handymen or people who have worked as laborers for another contractor or are self-taught who hang out their own shingle.<p>Sort of the same as software engineers.<p>It would be nice if there were a &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; test we could give contractors before hiring.<p>Hiring people who are unionized or who went through a union apprenticeship has been fairly reliable in my experience but union guys generally don&#x27;t work on small household projects and they don&#x27;t come cheap.</div><br/><div id="41229854" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41229854" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AyyEye</span><span>|</span><a href="#41226581">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227533">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41227447">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41229854">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41229854">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well the professionals are licensed bonded and insured.

But I think what I&#x27;ve realize is the dimension of &quot;we know what we need to do&quot; is actually pretty much orthogonal to the product, size of the company, tenure of the employees, etc. I&#x27;ve been in early stage startups with no PMF that nonetheless have strong product-centric leadership who can set down an unambiguous vision for what they believe needs to be done. And I&#x27;ve been in startups that have PMF yet have no vision, and everyone is standing around in their remote offices twiddling their thumbs on &quot;what to build next&quot;.<p>For large companies like FAANG, I actually think they mostly fall in bucket 2. I worked at Meta remotely for a year. My instructions when I joined were something like &quot;Yeah so just talk to a bunch of people and look for opportunities to contribute&quot;. WTF? No wonder remote is not working well for them. You had to go 5-6 layers up the reporting chain to find anyone with any sort of holistic sense of what needed to be done, and they were not exactly empowered to share that vision lest it conflict with someone elses.<p>TL;DR I think remote work is well set up for companies with leadership that resembles a benevolent dictatorship. I think if you are all-remote and your leadership is effectively &quot;managerial&quot; in nature, NGMI.</div><br/><div id="36253534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36253534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">72f988bf</span><span>|</span><a href="#36251536">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36251848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36253534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36253534">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In-person is much better if you don&#x27;t know what you need to build, are trying to &quot;figure it out as you go along&quot;, and are relying on the implicit fast feedback loop of standing next to each other.<p>true.<p>&gt; For large companies like FAANG, I actually think they mostly fall in bucket 2<p>Also true most fall in the &quot;figure it out&quot; bucket...

The reason? We had the time and space to work and communicate the way that made sense to us. We had plenty of shared pair&#x2F;group sessions to work out design ideas and experiments, iterate on the system, debug trickier issues... etc. Everything else we could do well asynchronously. Since this was longer-term, more speculative work, we didn&#x27;t have to worry about tickets or product&#x2F;management breathing down our necks every day.<p>On the other hand, the projects that suffered the most were the ones where folks had <i>less</i> scope and autonomy. If you can&#x27;t unilaterally make decisions for anything that spans more than a day, and you&#x27;re forced into some ticket-oriented process where everyone has &quot;their&quot; task to do, communication naturally suffers. If you&#x27;re all in the office, there&#x27;s a bit more slack to talk quickly and informally outside your immediate silo; remotely, this takes more intentionality, so the friction imposed by your culture and process has an outsize effect.<p>So my conclusion has been, pretty much, the opposite: remote works <i>better</i> when people have real scope, independence and autonomy. If engineers and small teams can make decisions over longer time-frames, they&#x27;ll have the space to adapt and work effectively. They might need somebody to set the example or foster the right habits, but it&#x27;s fundamentally healthy and effective. The frictions with remote work come up when it&#x27;s thrust against a less flexible culture that makes it harder for folks to adapt.</div><br/><div id="36252958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36252958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">majormajor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36251536">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36251848">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36252958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36252958">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think you&#x27;re using different phrasing to describe the same effect. Autonomy and the org knowing what it wants to do&#x2F;needs to do go hand in hand. In your long-term speculative research oriented work, you had autonomy because you knew what you were working on - not what it <i>was</i> in terms of tickets per se, but it sounds like you knew your scope and your objectives.<p>At 10+ person org sizes, most people can&#x27;t have long-term scope and autonomy if the management don&#x27;t know what it wants&#x2F;needs, since they&#x27;re just going to change their mind in a week or two. Once those decisions are made you can start delegating responsibility for execution.<p>The easy thing to do is to blame this all on poor management, but I think that&#x27;s too pat. I think figuring out the best way to use a team of 20, 100, 1000 engineers to accomplish business goals is just an incredibly hard problem... and one that&#x27;s often an ongoing, Sisyphean task, where high-bandwidth, low-latency communications are incredibly useful.</div><br/><div id="36253239" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36253239" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">extr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36251536">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36252762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36253239">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36253239">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I agree. Research is ideal for remote work, since you are effectively your own manager and by definition there is no specific vision that needs to be worked toward - you are discovering that vision yourself. It&#x27;s the literal ivory tower. In my experience if you give non-R&amp;D engineers and small teams total autonomy they will all end up building great solutions to problems that are slightly different than the problem you actually needed solved.<p>&gt; I think figuring out the best way to use a team of 20, 100, 1000 engineers to accomplish business goals is just an incredibly hard problem...<p>Agreed, don&#x27;t mean to downplay how difficult good management is. I think the key thing I&#x27;ve realized is that in a remote environment, bad management is so much more obvious and detrimental to the employee and organization. In office, if your manager doesn&#x27;t communicate vision&#x2F;objectives well you can always tap the shoulder of the guy next to you, or discretely pick your skip&#x27;s brain in the break room. The rest of the organization can pick up the slack.

There are so many aspects of software engineering where it’s so much easier to be sitting next to someone, pointing at their monitor, and discussing what and why you are doing something. Instead, you need to hop on a call and awkwardly screen share on a call or write out paragraphs of text to impart the knowledge. In my experience, having such barriers to doing these things makes new hires much less likely to reach out and put themselves into the situations where they can learn, no matter how much they are told it’s ok to bother people.<p>To me, this is why remote works so much better at smaller companies with less bespoke tooling and legacy code. There’s no better way to learn than in person and there is a huge productivity boost when doing so.

The company’s reason for existing is to generate profits from that one thing that really worked out.<p>Some companies are able to add great new products over time, but I sense that it’s more common for companies to have one great play, after which they either die or merge with another to enjoy better economies of scale.<p>If you’re big enough and rich enough, you tend to burn a ton of money on internal research groups, but very little of what gets researched is ever a successful product.

In my experience they only really started happening in late 2021&#x2F;early 2022 due to the pandemic, and since then they’ve been severely curtailed due to the market downturn. So when you do meet up it’s more about finally seeing people in person, team building, and restating your team’s goals and mission. Any brainstorming I’ve seen happens in over-long sessions with 30+ people in attendance, where a ton of ideas are generated but there’s no actual momentum once everyone gets on the plane back home. The real collaboration happens in the interstitial times- lunch, breaks, and so on. Which again points to the importance of having at least part of the team co-located.<p>Full disclosure, this is at a company that is hybrid and not remote-first. But I’ve seen the pattern repeated enough times across various teams that I don’t think my experience is unique.

You focus on being one of the 100(?) US programmers who becomes a manager. Good luck. I&#x27;ll just continue advocating return to office before that happens.

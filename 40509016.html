SpaceX sells payload delivery to telecom companies. Starlink is a current competitor to some of these companies and potentially increasingly so (whether through Starlink or other SpaceX ventures) in the future. The most effective way to sell payload delivery against SpaceX is to invoke the fear of further vertical integration and competition from them; SpaceX is otherwise the obvious choice on cost, options, and track record.

Tesla had a great connector and a huge charging network, but it was closed and proprietary with a non-interoperable digital protocol. Government and the rest of the industry demanded an open standard with an interoperable digital protocol that allowed for payments. Tesla thus faced the choice of having everyone adopt the inferior (open) CCS connector, making their current cars basically obsolete; or else releasing their excellent physical connector and opening their chargers to the whole world and adopting the existing CCS digital protocol. They rationally chose the latter and all of North America moved onto it. This is certainly “winning” in the sense that Tesla chose the option that wasn’t a total disaster for Tesla and their customers, and the world got to benefit from an excellent open standard.<p>ETA: If believing that this is “winning” causes Tesla folks to encourage further positive-sum behavior, ignore everything I said: Tesla kicked everyone’s ass.

The problem with telecoms is that there&#x27;s a physics imposed inverse relationship between frequency (speed) and wavelength (penetration&#x2F;distance). So it&#x27;s not like computing where we basically have gotten a free lunch with stuff that goes faster, runs cooler, and takes up less space.<p>Each upgrade with telecoms entails a sacrifice. You can have really fast signals that can&#x27;t go far and have difficulty penetrating obstacles like walls&#x2F;buildings&#x2F;hills&#x2F;etc, or you can have really far reaching and high penetrating signals that can&#x27;t go fast. So for instance Verizon&#x27;s max speed towers can only reach 1500 feet [1], so I think my estimate of ~2 miles was a pretty reasonable meet in the middle.<p>All that said I agree with you in principle. Obviously space based telecoms are much better for less populated areas than heavily populated, but I&#x27;d argue that that space based can scale much more easily. The ground based telecoms aren&#x27;t just those 140k towers, but also the other 450k nodes on top. And that&#x27;s to cover a pretty small geographic area. And each of those nodes not only needs land and construction permits, but they also need to be be regularly maintained, and so on. It&#x27;s a pretty big deal. For space based coverage, you can just launch your satellites from Texas and have them providing coverage on the other side of the world in a matter of minutes.<p>Put another way - imagine we were creating a civilization from scratch and these technologies were all &#x27;unlocked.&#x27; I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d be using ground based stuff much at all. In the present when the infrastructure already exists, there&#x27;s no reason not to take advantage of it, but in general it just doesn&#x27;t scale so well.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizon.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-far-does-5g-reach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizon.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;news&#x2F;how-far-does-5g-reach</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40520015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40520015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adgjlsfhk1</span><span>|</span><a href="#40518324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519102">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520423">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519839">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40520015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40520015">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this is only kind of true. 10000 towers is a lot when you consider that probably half of them are in very low density areas.

When you launch a rocket, fuel costs are basically a rounding error - well under a million dollars in general. Nearly all of your costs come from the rocket itself. And before SpaceX we were simply throwing away these rockets after a single use. Well technically the Space Shuttle was &quot;reusable&quot; but the refurbishment required was so extensive that they may as well have been rebuilding it from scratch after each launch. This is why SpaceX&#x27;s audacious initial goal of reducing space flight costs by orders of magnitude was completely viable.<p>I think companies will have difficulty competing against SpaceX, so long as SpaceX is ideologically motivated. Right now their goal isn&#x27;t to make a ton of money, but to create a stable civilization on Mars. So once we start headed to Mars them making next to no profit on launches, beyond what&#x27;s needed for development and basic sustainability, would be perfectly fine. So you not only need to hit technological parity, but then somehow also go well beyond them in terms of cost reductions - at least if your motivation is profit.</div><br/><div id="40521252" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40521252" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">isolli</span><span>|</span><a href="#40518324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520268">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520234">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40521252">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40521252">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not to mention that 2 out of 5 Space Shuttles suffered catastrophic loss, one of them (Columbia) almost certainly because it was being reused and the heat shield failed.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40520234" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40520234" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gibolt</span><span>|</span><a href="#40518324">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40519794">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40520268">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40521404">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40520234">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40520234">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The cost to develop in the first place may be too high, except for maybe nation states.<p>Falcon 9 funded Starship.

But I don&#x27;t think they are low on cash at this point or in need of more investments.<p>Sounds like a good investment to me. Too bad it&#x27;s a private company; I would have loved to buy some shares otherwise.<p>Other companies, like Boeing, are in fact spending lots of money as well on rockets.

I had expected to see an article about the emotional strain of not knowing if you&#x27;re in the control arm or the treatment arm for a late-stage trial. You know that you&#x27;re in an experiment, and you might get a new drug -- or existing standard of care -- depending on a roll of the dice.<p>This was very different. The author is describing a mad scramble to get enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial, and discussing the scramble as a life-or-death critical choice. Even ignoring the question of whether or not you&#x27;re in the control arm, these kinds of trials have no guarantee of much of anything. It&#x27;s even possible the <i>drug itself might hurt you</i>, because that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re looking for in phase 1. Per the clinical trial registration for PDL1V:<p>&gt; Part C will use the dose found in Parts A and B to find out how safe SGN-PDL1V is <i>and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.</i><p>(emphasis mine)<p>I don&#x27;t know if the author knows this, but I can&#x27;t imagine the stress of not being well-informed about the purpose of an experiment like this. And those doctors who are telling him things like <i>&quot;SGNTV had successfully shrunk a lot of tumors&quot;</i> is so maddening, if they didn&#x27;t follow that with <i>&quot;...but we don&#x27;t know what it will do in humans, because it&#x27;s a phase 1 trial&quot;</i>. It&#x27;s not at all clear that they did, because of things like this:<p>&gt; If I was given SGNTV, I’d have three systemic lines of therapy and be ineligible for PDL1V. And the same in reverse. Sophie’s Choice!<p>and later:<p>&gt; A downside of all these phase 1b studies is that there’s little published data, which makes comparisons difficult. Oncologists almost never give numbers: “We dosed 10 patients, and the disease control rate in phase 1a was 50%.” Instead, they’ll be vague, but they’ll also indicate why they think their top trials are their top trials.<p>If true, this is so, so, <i>so</i> irresponsible. Tell people that you don&#x27;t know the answer! The control could easily be better than the drug! Don&#x27;t give them false hope!<p>So agonizing.</div><br/><div id="40127912" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40127912" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jseliger</span><span>|</span><a href="#40124392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40127156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40127912">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40127912">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>Tell people that you don&#x27;t know the answer</i><p>I should probably clarify that point; oncologists are often dealing with small numbers and a lot of uncertainty. I&#x27;m also not sure how much they&#x27;re supposed to say—I don&#x27;t see the NDAs or other docs they sign with drug companies. That said, if they see tumors shrink in at least some patients, that&#x27;s pretty good.<p>I also have recurrent and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma originating in the tongue. A lot of these 1b and even 2 trials are being tested in multiple cancer types. Something can work pretty well in lung but not head and neck, or vice-versa.<p>They will say they don&#x27;t know the answer, but I prefer having some guidance. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are also relative, particularly for what I have, which is nearly always fatal. Is SGNTV good, cause it shrinks some people&#x27;s tumors, or bad, cause of all those side effects? The answer is both.<p>It&#x27;s still useful IMO to run sanity checks on what you&#x27;re told. For example, one onc said that I should try a trial very similar to this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oncnursingnews.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;lenvatinib-plus-pembrolizumab-generates-responses-but-no-os-benefit-in-hnscc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oncnursingnews.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;lenvatinib-plus-pembroli...</a>, or one like it, that had already failed. When I checked to see what research had been published, I was baffled by the rec. I checked w&#x2F; my oncologist at UCSD, and she was also like: &quot;I would probably not rank that trial highly.&quot;</div><br/><div id="40127990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40127990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">timr</span><span>|</span><a href="#40124392">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40127912">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129572">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40127990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40127990">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I&#x27;m also not sure how much they&#x27;re supposed to say—I don&#x27;t see the NDAs or other docs they sign with drug companies.

This can&#x2F;does lead to people making bold claims on thin evidence.<p>That said, I do hope it works out for you, and I wish you the best.

It&#x27;s not like engineering, which is fundamentally the practice of applied science.  Medicine came from a very different path, basically like voodoo or witchcraft, and has been struggling to become more scientific.  Many fields of medicine are fundamentally unscientific, such as chiropractic.<p>Also, doctors (mostly) aren&#x27;t scientists or researchers at all: they&#x27;re basically what non-medical engineers and scientists would consider &quot;technicians&quot;.  They use tools and knowledge the scientists and engineers have found or made, and apply them to individual problems (i.e. patients).<p>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t help at all that the systems doctors work on (human bodies) are ridiculously complex, and themselves not at all a product of engineering.  And on top of that, every human is somewhat different, so things that work on one don&#x27;t work on others.<p>Personally, I think the entire field of western medicine, though it&#x27;s still better than the ridiculously unscientific forms of traditional medicine it competes with, needs some work to improve its scientific foundations.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40128405" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40128405" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">s1artibartfast</span><span>|</span><a href="#40124392">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40127990">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129572">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40128405">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40128405">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;But it&#x27;s a long way from any sort of proof, and they really should only be saying &quot;we don&#x27;t know, and you&#x27;re taking part in an experiment to find out&quot;.<p>I think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what doctors are communicating.

The same experience that motivated my comment in the AskHN a couple of days ago asking how to engage the healthcare community to find opportunities to build something useful [1]<p>“Bess and I have learned not to wait. The healthcare system often moves slowly, and it’s good to be agentic. Insufficient agency is how people die while waiting for some indifferent bureaucrat to get back to them, or for some other bureaucratic process to spin up before the rapidly dividing cancer cells spin someone down”<p>So many little statements in that article ring true but I felt this deep in my core.  Your notes about the onc being on vacation resurrected a little taste of the bile I had in my heart for the infuriating pace of everything.<p>I got to a point of deep, seething hatred for it all until one day my wife’s surgeon broke down crying on the phone.  That little glimmer of humanity in what felt like a giant broken machine made me take a moment of pause and consider that some of the seeming indifference and immunity to the urgency might be self-protection.  I have no idea what it’s like to work in a field where progress is so slow and the stakes are so high.<p>I wish you the best and thank you so much for sharing your journey so vividly.

You&#x27;re treating a vast (and ever growing) number of people each year, you&#x27;re overworked and buried in paperwork, and in the end - regardless of how much personal attention you dedicate (or don&#x27;t) to somebody, their odds of survival are not going to change much. It&#x27;s soul crushing work that&#x27;s often paired with lots of quite dark humor. The more death you&#x27;re around, the darker and more frequent the humor becomes, to the point I don&#x27;t feel comfortable offering examples here. It&#x27;s a coping mechanism.<p>And then after all of this you need to go to the next patient, smile, and do your best to make them feel comfortable and completely confident in everything you say, all the while they [understandably] see their or their loved one&#x27;s case as the single most important thing in the world. If you want to create a tech solution for something, it would definitely be the paperwork. But it&#x27;s mired in a million rules, regulations, and restrictions that alone probably make any sort of effort to streamline it probably unworkable if not unlawful.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40129807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40129807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">short_sells_poo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40124392">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129572">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40129920">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40127156">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40129807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40129807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m sorry for what your wife and you have gone through and I cannot imagine the frustration caused when being at the mercy of a seemingly uncaring bureaucracy and having little power to do anything.<p>I do think that more often than not, the doctors appear uncaring because they&#x27;re under a very similar feeling that you experienced - but all the time. If they don&#x27;t build emotional barriers, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to cope.

If it does leave leaves anything out, there&#x27;s a good chance somebody is going change it to include that thing.<p>It&#x27;s not that they actually <i>want</i> to reproduce it exactly, but that that stuff gives a baseline they can tweak to create refined versions.<p>That&#x27;s incompatible with the steganography. If you have all the alleged inputs, you can detect an image bearing steganographic data by trying to reproduce it. And if it&#x27;s <i>normal</i> to include all of the inputs, then images without them are going to look suspicious.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem <i>useless</i>. Even so, it seems as though it&#x27;d be a lot <i>more useful</i> if the people writing image generation software could be convinced to play along by using truly unpredictable cryptographic RNGs. But that would mean giving up reproducibility that I think they value.</div><br/><div id="41614588" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41614588" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">orbital-decay</span><span>|</span><a href="#41614425">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41614588">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41614588">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reproducibility was only possible very early on for a very short time a couple years ago.

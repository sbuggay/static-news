Whilst some people (mostly spectrum) do seem have an innate talent, I would argue that it is more an inbuilt ability to hyper focus on a topic, whether that topic be mathematics, Star Trek, dinosaurs or legacy console games from the 1980’s.<p>I think we do our children a disservice by convincing them that some of their peers are just “born with it”, because it discourages them from continuing to try.<p>What we should be teaching children is HOW to learn. At the moment it’s a by-product of learning about some topic.

Math and logic are just those models that are continuous+topological and discrete+logic-operation variants, both based in dimension&#x2F;orthogonality. But all modeling is over attribution - facts, opinions, etc., and there&#x27;s a lot of modeling with a healthy dose of salience - heuristics, emotions, practice, etc.  Math by design is salience-free (though it incorporates goals and weights), so it&#x27;s the perspective and practice that liberates people from bias and assumptions.  In that respect it can be beautiful, and makes other more conditioned reasoning seem tainted (but it has to work harder to be relevant).<p>However, experts can project mathematical models onto reality.  Hogwash about quantum observer effects and effervescent quantum fields stem from projecting the assumptions required to do the math (or adopt the simplifying forms).  Yes, the model is great at predictions.  No, it doesn&#x27;t say what else is possible, or even what we&#x27;re seeing (throwing baseballs at the barn, horses run out, so barns are made of horses...).  Something similar happens with AI math: it can generate neat output, so it must be intelligent.  The impulse is so strong that adherents declare that non-symbolic thinking is not thinking at all, and discount anything unquantifiable (in discourse at least).

Almost everyone can probably expand their mathematical thinking abilities with deliberate practice.<p>&gt; But I do not think this is innate, even though it often manifests in early childhood. Genius is not an essence. It’s a state. It’s a state that you build by doing a certain job.<p>Though his opinion on mathematical geniuses above, I somewhat disagree with. IMO everyone has a ceiling when it comes to math.</div><br/><div id="42201217" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42201217" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">felideon</span><span>|</span><a href="#42201066">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42202201">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42201217">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42201217">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; IMO everyone has a ceiling when it comes to math.<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s higher than you think: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justinmath.com&#x2F;your-mathematical-potential-has-a-limit-but-its-likely-higher-than-you-think&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justinmath.com&#x2F;your-mathematical-potential-has-a...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42202201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42202201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kristopolous</span><span>|</span><a href="#42201066">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42201785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42202201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42202201">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">there&#x27;s thinking mathematically and then there&#x27;s being able to fluently read math articles on wikipedia as if they&#x27;re easier than ernest hemingway.

It’s truly incredible. I’m doing around 60-90 minutes a day and properly understanding and developing an intuition for things. They’ve got 3 pre-uni courses and I’ve now nearly finished the first one. It’s truly a revelation to be able to intuit and solve even simple problems and, having skipped ahead so far in my previous study, see fuzzy links to what’s coming.<p>Cannot recommend it enough.

Many banks across the world offer their own HCE wallets, but these only run on Android (Apple simply doesn&#x27;t offer the necessary APIs, although that&#x27;s now changing in the EU).<p>What does matter a lot are defaults: You can only have one default Visa, Mastercard etc. wallet per device (that you don&#x27;t need to specifically need to open before tapping your phone), so Google Pay has a huge advantage there, since it supports cards by many banks and not just one as would be the case for an issuer HCE wallet.<p>&gt; However, I&#x27;m sometimes under the impression that Apple&#x2F;Google take on the role of a payment gateway or a payment method themselves.<p>They don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re involved in mediating the initial setup of a new card on a given device, but aren&#x27;t part of the actual transaction flow at all (at the POS, in any case).<p>&gt; Moreover, I noticed that some merchants refuse my payment when I use e.g. Google Pay with my Amex instead of my MasterCard.<p>The underlying card brand still needs to be accepted by the merchant. Unlike e.g. early Google Pay (or what it was called back then; I lost track) and some other solutions, modern-day Google Pay and Apple Pay aren&#x27;t &quot;proxy cards&quot; (which can sometimes change the card brand, e.g. from Visa to Mastercard; an example of that would be Curve).<p>&gt; it also seems payment terminals at the grocery store needed special support for the Apple&#x2F;Google Pay apps.<p>They don&#x27;t. Unless a given POS terminal is buggy, it&#x27;ll work anywhere that otherwise accepts the underlying card scheme. The physical and logical protocols are exactly the same as for actual plastic cards and mostly indistinguishable to the terminal; actually breaking Apple Pay&#x2F;Google Pay support needs a lot of destructive energy on the merchant&#x27;s&#x2F;PSP&#x27;s side.<p>On the web it&#x27;s a different story; explicit support by both the store website and payment service provider is needed there.</div><br/><div id="39848967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">amatecha</span><span>|</span><a href="#39846141">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848833">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, recently my Apple Watch stopped being usable with the tap terminals at a certain gas station chain here.

Part of this cryptogram will tell the terminal Yes&#x2F;No to proceed and whether it needs to ask for a PIN or go online to the acquiring bank for approval. The terminal applies its own rules to the transaction as well, and can optionally downgrade the transaction from approved to online or denied, or from online to denied.<p>If it needs to go online, it will transmit the transaction details to the acquiring (merchant&#x27;s) bank, which may approve the transaction immediately or itself refer the transaction to the issuing (your) bank.

The rest comes from the convenience and hope that actually results in more card payments.<p>In the US where there&#x27;s no PIN, fraud is high. Parts of the country are still heavily cash based, so there&#x27;s a good margin to gain if added convenience results in more card payments.<p>For heavily credit card based markets with chip-and-pin, you have less fraud concerns and less to gain from convenience.<p>My take though is that even if apple opens up the NFC chip, they aren&#x27;t opening up the Secure Enclave. So even if a bank app can take over the NFC chip, they still will have secrets in memory at some point without a new P-256 based payment protocol.<p>Unless this is a new app backed by a bank cartel, you&#x27;ll also go from being able to use multiple cards to just one first-party card.<p>This all leads to my opinion of a pretty wonky situation - opening NFC up probably increases the value of Apple Pay, since it can now be compared to other software-based wallets by users, and Apple Pay support again becomes a differentiator for the payment card.</div><br/><div id="39847809" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847809" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">troad</span><span>|</span><a href="#39846031">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847424">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848115">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847809">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847809">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Unless this is a new app backed by a bank cartel<p>Good news - they&#x27;ve already got the cartel ready to go, and it&#x27;s conveniently already in bed with the regulators!

Out of four, only the Commonwealth Wank has transitioned onto a modern core banking platform for retail banking. Business accounts still run on the legacy core banking platform, if my understanding is current and accurate.<p>The remaining ones are as backward (from the technology POV) as they have always been. Westpac acquired St George Bank in 2008 trumpeting their core banking platform as the reason for the acquisition and the intention to transition onto it. To the best of my knowledge, that has not happened as of 2024, and Westpac contunues to use its own legacy core banking platform <i>disjointly</i> from that of St George&#x27;s. Moreover, banking is not even integrated between the two even today, and the St George core banking has fell into a state of disrepair – EFT&#x27;s can take a few days to reach the receipient&#x27;s account depending on the receipient&#x27;s bank.<p>The actual – pretty much only – innovator is Macquarie Bank that has invested a lot into revamping their banking platform from the ground up, plus neo-banks – newcomers to the banking market albeit niche ones.<p>The Big Four (or, most banks in general) loathe technology and IT as they see both as a liability, not a competitive advantage, due to tech not being their core business and due to being run by old farts with ossified brains. And that was the reason why they started rapidly losing millenials, Gen Z and other young customers to neobanks. It was a wake-up call for them.<p>&gt; […] instant transfers are normalized […]<p>… and it has nothing to do with the Big Four. The Big Four, in fact, sabotaged instant payments for many years due to a lack of interest to advance the payment technology, and the instant payments in Australia only succeeded at the third (or at the fourth – I have lost the count) attempt after the Reserve Bank held the Big Four at a gunpoint and threatened them with severe penalties if they pull out <i>again</i>, as they had done every single time before. Instant payments in Australia are done via NPP&#x2F;Osco, an independent company set up by the RBA, a BPAY subsidiary, and the Big Four as well as other local banks are mere users of it. None of the four control NPP&#x2F;Osco payments, and that is a very good thing.<p>&gt; If the NFC chips were opened up through regulation I have zero doubt Australian banks would just say &quot;we support contactless with our first party app&quot; […]<p>… and users would be left with the atrocious quality banking apps and with banks tracking the users all the way down into the customer&#x27;s colons.<p>User tracking was the actual reason behind the spat between the Big Four and Apple – the former wanted to get a way into users&#x27; smartphones and all sorts of device and chip ID&#x27;s – to track the user behaviour to which Apple said no. As a customer, Apple&#x27;s stance suits me way more.<p>Of course, banks have found other ways to track the iPhone users courtesy of advances in the big data science, although the attempt has been somewhat hampered.

Or that someone will break into another account on the IdP&#x27;s login form?<p>I don&#x27;t see any difference with email besides convenience. If an email provider has a bug, they might allow someone else to read your email and click the link without any notification to the actual account owner that such an authentication occurred. In fact, if a provider has oauth and webmail, the two probably use the same authentication system (e.g. they use the same session cookie and login form, or the webmail might use the oauth service as its auth). Even native email clients are using oauth these days. This is a <i>good</i> thing. It lets you store a token with limited permission in your email client instead of storing a password for SMTP that also gives you full permissions to everything the account can do.<p>Also most oauth implementations I&#x27;ve seen actually <i>do</i> have a dashboard in your user settings where they record which services you&#x27;ve provided tokens to, and what scopes those tokens have.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about CSRF, that&#x27;s what the state parameter is for, and it&#x27;s the consuming service that needs to use it appropriately, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about whether the IdP did it right.

It does send a bunch of data to the terminal on request as an early part of the process, then receives transaction data back, arranges it with some internal bits of its own, pads, hashes and encrypts it using a key (usually a session key derived from a stored private key) and sends back the resulting cryptogram to the terminal. In fact your card makes important decisions about whether to allow the transaction to proceed, based on the transaction data, various counters and limits it maintains, etc etc. If the card doesn&#x27;t approve the transaction (and show that approval in its cryptogram), the terminal cannot approve.<p>You phone does the same stuff, but obviously without needing to use the power the reader puts out.<p>The problem with displaying the amount <i>before</i> you validate, is that it would interrupt the process and require running the transaction in two halves, and it would kill the &quot;tap&#x27;n&#x27;go&quot; aspect of the transaction. But the phone can immediately display the amount afterwards.<p>Incidentally, this sort of thing is why we have rules that the <i>terminal</i> must display the amount in a way that&#x27;s visible to the customer, to be compliant.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s listening for the request from an NFT reader, at which point it beams out your &#x27;card number&#x27;, and that is that.<p>This is definitely not the case, and if it were the case, contactless cards would be trivial to clone!</div><br/></div></div><div id="39847874" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847874" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gruez</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847011">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847745">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39845608">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847874">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847874">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;NFT reader<p>NF<i>C</i> reader</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39845608" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39845608" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mikestew</span><span>|</span><a href="#39847011">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848563">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39845608">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39845608">[26 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Where did Gruber say that “only Apple Pay does this”?

So you put more in, even the slightly weaker stuff, so you can compromise on it during negotiations.<p>I wouldn’t have know this stuff, which is why I don’t pretend to know this stuff. Unlike Gruber and Thomson. Instead I follow lawyers online and speak to friends who are lawyers who have a better idea of what’s going on.<p>The ridiculous part of Gruber’s assertions is because he hears about these things only when Apple is involved he seems to think they are unique or new. That’s why his insinuations in a couple of posts that the EU actions were to punish American companies and protect European ones. If he had half a clue about this area he would have known that the EU has fined way more European companies than it has companies from the rest of the world put together.</div><br/><div id="39846619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39846619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MBCook</span><span>|</span><a href="#39845608">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846252">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39846444">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39846619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39846619">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The fact that the DOJ may be able to win the case does not make an antitrust case like this the correct way to legislate how we want companies to operate.<p>It would be SO MUCH SIMPLER to just pass a law that says “sideloading has to be legal, easy, and free”.

A court said they are legally in the clear.

Or perhaps win a verdict and charge them a whole bunch of money for stuff that doesn’t matter all that much because again, some of the stuff they seem to be really mad about Apple already won on in another trial.<p>The DOJ is supposed to be about enforcement, not creating the laws. This is not how this process should be working.

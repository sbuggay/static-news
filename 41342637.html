Or maybe it hits on the right reason, but the wrong cause. The defender’s job isn’t defense. Cyber security isn’t a sportsball game where there are clear even goals and objectives with alternating positions. It’s a side show, and a distraction from the main business of whatever else the defenders are trying to do. By contrast, an attacker’s entire job is to attack the system. There is no other purpose they are serving, no secondary masters or considerations that need to be used to weaken their attacks.<p>Attackers win for the same reason that Microsoft is better at publishing operating systems than Cisco, because ciscos operating systems are a means to an end.

It might not be useful, but it is completely secure.<p>Even less flippantly though, we inherently know this. How many things do we do every day that could be &quot;more secure&quot;, but &quot;more secure&quot; gets in the way? Do you use memorize 256 character unique passwords for every site and system and refuse to record them even in a password manager? Do you use GPG encrypted emails and only E2E encrypted messaging services? Are all your home network devices independently fire walled, with strict in AND outbound rules ensuring they can only talk to the specific devices they should be able to talk to and only on specific well defined ports? Have you hardened your home network against data exfiltration via DNS queries? Is all network traffic fully encrypted with mutual client and server cert validations? If you&#x27;ve answered no to any of these questions, you have chosen to prioritize something else over better cyber security defense. And it&#x27;s probably a good bet that at least some of that is because doing these things would actively get in the way of doing what you actually want to do with your electronic devices.

Here are some other things you should do:<p>1) Use separate accounts and machines for administration tasks.  Basically, IT people should never use their e-mail, web browsing, and development machine for system management tasks.  They should use a separate machine with a different account for these tasks.  The main reason is the system management machine has a much smaller attack surface.  Ideally, it should only run a communications program (IRC, Slack, MS Teams, etc.), and the tools the person needs to do their job.  Examples of tools people need include SSH, Remote Desktop, kubectl (Kubernetes tool to manage a cluster), etc.  The machine should have a web browser BUT the web browser should be restricted to the bare minimum number of sites needed to administer the systems.  Examples of acceptable sites include the Azure Portal, the AWS web site, web sites to configure equipment, etc.  Examples of things which are not allowed include web mail, documentation, etc.  The goal is to have the smallest possible attack surface.<p>2) People need to be mindful of what they install on their machines.  I have seen a lot of people who will install anything which looks useful on their machine.  This is a great way to get hacked.  Here are the questions people need to ask before installing software.<p>- Why do I trust the people who wrote the software?
- Why was the software created?  What was the motivation of the author?
- How does the author support himself or herself?  What would happen if one of the authors was in financial distress?
- How will I know when the software needs to be updated?
- What are the capabilities of the software&#x27;s authors?  Do the authors understand how to write secure software?  How do the authors handle security bug reports?<p>Basically, you ask these questions because you want to avoid malware, and you want to use software which fixes its security problems.<p>3) Consider putting system management machines on a different network or VPN.  Basically, it&#x27;s harder to hack a machine if you can&#x27;t easily communicate with it.<p>4) System management machines should not be listening on any ports (or should have a firewall which blocks all connection attempts).  It&#x27;s harder to break into a machine when an attacker cannot connect to it.<p>5) Put the system management machines behind a firewall.<p>6) Consider what happens when an account is eventually hacked.  Many people assume that only dumb or incompetent people get hacked.  Unfortunately, this is not true.  Systems should be designed to assume accounts will get hacked.  The best designs limit the blast radius (damage) of account attacks.<p>7) All users should have limited privileges.  Basically, they should get the privileges they need to do their jobs.  Very few people should be allowed to have the equivalent of root&#x2F;Administrator for the entire system (obviously, people may have these permissions for some machines but almost no account should be able to do anything on any system the organization runs).</div><br/><div id="41344694" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41344694" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akira2501</span><span>|</span><a href="#41344378">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41344579">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41343930">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41344694">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41344694">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What I meant is even doing all this you&#x27;re effectively a single 0-day away from total compromise and are now dependent on specific workarounds or on getting the update that patches the vulnerability.<p>Because of this I can&#x27;t consider the security of the AD as any better or worse than the desktop that connects to it and it&#x27;s pointless to pretend that you can even have this.<p>We did have a crypto locker that spread on our network this way between our AD machines.

I&#x27;ve been an incident responder and have experience with penetration testing and red teaming. I think that, while reductive, this is somewhat true, but not necessarily as negative as the the article reads. Defense is made up of many things. For instance, developing effective controls to reduce the risk and impact of a security event, identifying attacks and compromise, and responding to the events. Lists of standards and responses work well. Defense also includes architectural decisions which require thinking about the graph of the network to develop these controls. There are lots of disciplines in defense too: architecture&#x2F;engineering, risk management, incident response, application security, education, threat intelligence, and so on.<p>Also interesting that the author implies the problem is about thinking of defense in lists then provides a list of items to consider to improve defense.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41343933" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41343933" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lmeyerov</span><span>|</span><a href="#41343930">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41343240">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41343933">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41343933">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A formal way to frame this insight is how a formal methods security researcher might: graph-based program verification.<p>A lot of core confidentiality and integrity security problems come down to &#x27;safety property&#x27; verification (a notion from model checking), which in turn comes down to reachability on a program flow graph (a notion from program analysis). This is also true of access control verification, but that&#x27;s a topic for another day.<p>Imagine a dataflow or points-to analysis on a program, and extend it all the way to include the code in your OS and the cloud and the database. These analyses create a graph, and the question is can an attacker get from an entrypoint and precondition of some  node A (a line of code) and traverse to the assets on point B (another line of code.)<p>Interestingly, the security field is increasingly getting there, with ideas like CNAPP, IAM&#x2F;Cedar, AD&#x2F;bloodhound, where we are getting these basic access graphs modulated by estate, identity, access policy, etc. Often we don&#x27;t even really need the programs, because it&#x27;s more about a distributed system where we can focus just on identities and policies across trust zones. (Eg, If a box gets hacked, that exposes other credentials on the same box.)<p>At the same time, anyone working in these things also knows graph reachability is simplistic 80&#x27;s &amp; 90&#x27;s stuff: there can be complex logical policies at each node, So we&#x27;re seeing things like modeling those harder points, not just as pure reachability, But also things we can actually peek into and more richly verify, such as by modeling fancy ABAC policies using smt solvers.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really where the author is coming from, but it&#x27;s a reason the article resonated with me for so many years from a principled perspective, and I think it&#x27;s incredibly practical and important today.<p>(Disclaimer: we do crazy GPU graph AI power tools for folks in the space at Graphistry &#x2F; Louie.AI, in my first verification papers here were almost 20 years ago, so I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="41343240" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41343240" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dzink</span><span>|</span><a href="#41343933">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41343948">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41343240">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41343240">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sounds like there need to be one or more honeypots in each network for catching intruders in the system.

Schizoanalysis works differently. It avoids Ideas, and sticks to diagrams: networking software for accessing bodies without organs. BWOs, machinic singularities, or tractor fields emerge through the combination of parts with (rather than into) their whole; arranging composite individuations in a virtual&#x2F; actual circuit. They are additive rather than substitutive, and immanent rather than transcendent: executed by functional complexes of currents, switches, and loops, caught in scaling reverberations, and fleeing through intercommunications, from the level of the integrated planetary system to that of atomic assemblages. Multiplicities captured by singularities interconnect as desiring-machines; dissipating entropy by dissociating flows, and recycling their machinism as self-assembling chronogenic circuitry.</div><br/><div id="41343082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41343082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notjoemama</span><span>|</span><a href="#41343026">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41343082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41343082">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Amongst the linguistic hand waving is information theory.

When someone does the math and adds up the winners and losers in all this, one clear winner will be this video from Asianometry, entitled The History of Superconductors (Before LK-99)[1]. It only lightly touched on LK-99 itself, but did an excellent job going through the actual science-based history of superconductors, covering in particular detail previous hype waves. A major point is that the YBCO superconductors, while an amazing scientific discovery, haven&#x27;t had revolutionary applications, and have only lightly displaced lower temperature (niobium-titanium metal alloy) superconductors in applications requiring generating strong magnetic fields, including MRI machines. For the curious, [2] goes into considerable detail on potential applications and challenges for HTSC in MRI.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wUczYHyOhLM">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wUczYHyOhLM</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5472374&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5472374&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="37155697" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37155697" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DennisP</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149634">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37153972">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37158803">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37155697">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37155697">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">REBCO is revolutionizing fusion reactors.

Electrical resistance is not the only thing you need for something to be an economically efficient power line. While superconductors are by definition excellent in terms of electrical resistance, there is nothing to guarantee that they wouldn&#x27;t be too brittle, or too heavy, or too hard to mould into the required shape, or simply require materials that are too rare on Earth. And all of these would not be things that can just be worked around with better production processes or smart engineering - they would be fundamental limitations of the specific material, just like the low temperature requirements of currently known superconductors will never be improved with more research.<p>So this isn&#x27;t a matter of <i>when</i> they would reach the point of being better economically, it&#x27;s also very much a matter of <i>if</i> they would ever reach that point. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll get lucky one day and find a material that is superconducting at room temperature and above, that is study and light and easy to make into wires and made out of abundantly available elements. LK-99 certainly wasn&#x27;t most of these things.

Or at least publicly demonstrate that they tried (key phrasing). But it is also silly to think that 3-5 people sitting at a desk reading a summary of work can validate said work. Really they can only invalidate or specify that it is indeterminate, but neither of these are validation. Which that&#x27;s a key difference from the general public understanding of &quot;peer review&quot; (meaning journal publication).<p>But it might also be worth noting that often reproduction happens behind the scene. People point to big works like that which comes out of CERN, LIGO, or other massive projects and state that such works cannot be replicated. But actually those have high rates of replication, which is why there are hundreds of authors on the work.<p>For LK-99, people got to see a lot of what is typically done by grad students who never tell the public what they did (or even their community). That the communication between scientists is happening through preprints, email, twitter, and other methods that are not journal publications. Because science happens faster than the journal cycle. Most scientists are reading preprints, and letting the work dictate the signal of validity long before a journal can.<p>But what I was alluding to, which you might have picked up on, is that the reward system we have in place (&quot;publish or perish&quot;, h-index, journals, etc) are misaligned as they do not reward this cornerstone of science -- replication -- (typically discourages is) unless there are credible claims of breakthroughs of the highest kind. Maybe we should rethink this system, and I hope that the timing of this along with the other discussions of academic fraud can help people to question the system and metrics that we use to evaluate, and ask if they are actually aligned with the original goals.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37154740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37154740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctorpangloss</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149634">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151117">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151162">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37156237">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37154740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37154740">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Because the truth is that our academic incentive structure has generally fallen out of alignment with the actual goals of science.<p>Did it though?

I think you are misunderstanding what papers are. Papers are simply a communication method between domain experts. The purpose of journals is to improve distribution and to provide a signal to help experts sift through the (possibly) large number of work. But you need question if they are accomplishing the goals. Do they provide more access than arxiv? Certainly no, arxiv is about as accessible as it comes. Do they provide better distribution than other modes? (colleagues, google scholar, semantic scholar, Twitter, etc) This is debatable and likely depends on your domain. Do they provide a useful signal to other experts? Also arguable and depends on your field. I&#x27;d say that the more papers&#x2F;yr in your field, the weaker the signal. THEN you need to ask if these benefits outweigh the costs. That&#x27;s both monetary costs from governments, corporations, and universities as well as the time costs to format the papers for the specified venue, deal with the back and forth with reviewers, and being a reviewer yourself.

A proper challenge requires coming up to the plate, proposing a challenging hypothesis to a given conclusion, and then going through the work required to test your hypothesis, documenting the inputs, the variables, and showcasing your outputs.<p>What this doesn&#x27;t mean is the average human who does not like the conclusion producing a statement saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s real&quot;, or even going so far as to cite data which could appear to refute the conclusion, are producing a challenge to the conclusion.

You also really, really don’t want to have to retract a paper because you’ve missed something obvious. Retraction is a traumatic process even if you are in good faith. This is sidestepped by releasing preprints (so no peer review and no risk of retraction). But at the same time this is a reason why outlandish preprints tend not to be taken too seriously. There is less incentives to get it right.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37150560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37150560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marginalia_nu</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149634">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37149730">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37150462">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37150282">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37150560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37150560">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There&#x27;s this bizarre reaction I see from many where they see the excitement and curiosity and hopefulness as a form of error and source of embarrassment.

First, Moriarty was pretty much exactly spot on in his skepticism: the reduction in resistivity is <i>not</i> the behavior you&#x27;d expect to see in a superconductor (turned out to be due to copper sulfide impurities), and that the floating in a magnet behavior is not that surprising and could be due to diamagnetism.<p>2.

The fascinating story behind LK99 is incredibly human - including the rushing a preprint out to secure a noble prize by one of the researchers who was being excluded. The fascinating part to me was the fact engineers and scientists could on their own time try to replicate and did so in the open. People were excited and eager for it to be true and found hope in the ambiguity and excitement in the partial successes, and dreamed of what could be. Then, through careful analysis by experts who know their subjects well, we learned it was not the magic we dreamed it might be but a magic that we already knew about. A negative result of something so many people wished to be true is an ultimate victory of science, and to me more exciting than a positive result in many ways.

But now they are (though they haven’t been used in such a large scale) and you can bet that they’ll jump at any opportunity to get rid of the helium loop and take advantage of the stronger magnetic fields you can get with YBCO.</div><br/><div id="37154992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37154992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149824">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151154">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37154992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37154992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This should not be downvoted.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37151641" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37151641" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">penjelly</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149824">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151154">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37154992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37155705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37151641">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37151641">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">can you make wires from cermets?

Even so, we are perfectly able to make fibre optics cables with silica, which is a ceramic.<p>&gt; we need a substance that is malleable(?) enough like copper wire that electrons can pass through.<p>Malleability (actually, ductility) has nothing to do with electric conductivity. It can be useful depending on the use case, but for example on a printed circuit you don’t care about that. Not everything is a dangling wire.<p>YBCO a ceramic superconductor, it is used in thin films that are deposited on metallic substrates in tapes and it works well. See figure 2 of the paper here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;271637455_Dipole_Magnet_from_High_Tc_Superconductor" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;271637455_Dipole_Ma...</a> .<p>Also, you might not realise this but pretty much nothing is malleable at liquid helium temperature.<p>&gt; Pottery ceramic wont work like that.<p>Sigh. Ceramics are not pottery, and more than 99% of the time do not have anything to do with pottery. Ceramics are compounds that are not intermetallic, typically oxides, sulphides, nitrides, etc. Some are bendy (though generally less than metallic alloys), some are hard, some are electric conductors, some are not. They have very diverse sets of properties.<p>They are everywhere in the chips on the device you use, in its display, in the power plants that make electrons move so you can use it, in any lithium-ion battery, etc. I don’t think I can name one device that does not involve ceramics. Even a shovel, either in the form of a passive layer that makes it stainless, or in the form of rust on it. None of that has anything to do with pottery.</div><br/><div id="37155861" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37155861" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149824">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37152957">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37155571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37155861">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37155861">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this misconception stems from people thinking &#x27;earthenware&#x27; or &#x27;clay&#x27; when they hear &#x27;ceramics&#x27;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37155571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37155571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MissingAFew</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149824">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151641">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37152957">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37155705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37155571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37155571">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If that&#x27;s the point, then they are completely unqualified to be commenting.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37155705" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37155705" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spiznnx</span><span>|</span><a href="#37149824">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37150100">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37150763">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37149977">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37155705">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37155705">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">you are (mostly) agreeing (except for precise definitions of metallic and ceramic).

Room temperature and pressure super conductors seem hard enough to find that chances are any given paper claiming to have found one will end up with a more mundane explanation. And I do think the information about the phase change of Cu2S is highly relevant, as it points at a way the original researches my have fooled themselves.<p>The dismissal of the partial levitation as ferromagnetism, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t strike me as especially robust. Ferromagnetism explains the partial levitation of tiny fragments of material generated by people trying to reproduce LK-99. Very light and thin pieces of ferromagnetic material will align themselves with a magnetic field. For example, Andrew McCalip (who streamed himself attempting to reproduce the material in his rocket startup&#x27;s lab) generated a partially levitating fragment and sent it into USC, where they determined it was ferromagnetic. But bulk pieces of ferromagnetic material will just stick to magnets (or if they are magnetized, they will stick to one side and be unstably repelled from the other).<p>Ferromagnetism doesn&#x27;t explain the levitation demonstrated in the videos put out by the original researches, though. Barring fraud, the most likely explanation for that kind of levitation is diamagnetism. The article mentions Derrick van Gennep recreating the partial levitation video with a chunk of pyrolytic graphite (one of the most diamagnetic materials we know of, other than superconductors), supergluing iron filings to a corner of it to anchor it to the magnet. The levitation in that video comes from diamagnetism, not ferromagnetism. LK-99 is primarily made of lead, not graphite, which is 5-10 times denser, so the diamagnetic effect must be at least that much stronger than pure pyrolytic graphite. The thing is, as the rest of the article points out, the supposed main constituents of LK-99 have now been extensively studied, and none of them appear to be especially diamagnetic, so something in those samples the original team recorded must be extremely diamagnetic to make up for it!</div><br/><div id="37153050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37153050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">floxy</span><span>|</span><a href="#37152069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37153735">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37153050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37153050">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;so something in those samples the original team recorded must be extremely diamagnetic to make up for it!<p>I wonder what would have happened if they would have pushed a paper out talking about anomalously high diamagnetism and skipped any mentions of superconducting.

But I hope that we see some group try to replicate the diamagnetic material properties.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37156806" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37156806" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dougSF70</span><span>|</span><a href="#37152069">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37157407">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37156806">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37156806">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank God, this means I can stop pretending to be a twitter expert on superconductivity.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37157407" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37157407" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sanroot99</span><span>|</span><a href="#37156806">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37157407">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37157407">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p3hubvTsf3Y">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p3hubvTsf3Y</a> , reality check</div><br/></div></div><div id="37151567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37151567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cynusx</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157407">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37157072">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37151567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37151567">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m curious (but not really qualified to understand) if the theoretical calculations on viable superconducting structures was a new insight on its own.<p>If there is a theoretical model for ambient temperature superconductivity, then that should help us zoom in on potential materials that could be an actual superconductor someday?</div><br/></div></div><div id="37157072" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37157072" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CliffStoll</span><span>|</span><a href="#37151567">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37156465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37157072">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37157072">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">N-Rays<p>Neo-Lamarckian Midwife Toads<p>Polywater<p>Cold Fusion<p>Schön&#x27;s Single Molecule Organic Transistors<p>Cloned human stem cells<p>Faster-than-light Neutrinos</div><br/></div></div><div id="37156465" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37156465" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">k2718281828y</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157072">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37151485">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37156465">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37156465">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Founders- note, you just experienced a mini-bubble.

But nearly four decades later, there is still debate over the material’s superconducting mechanism, says Vishik. Efforts to explain LK-99 came readily.<p>To me, the interesting take-away is that, right at the end. All too often we see peer-review as this slow, inching, <i>excruciating</i> process, particularly in social sciences where it&#x27;s a de-facto afterthought. It was great to see science chugging ferociously away like a (somewhat!) well-oiled machine, such as the electronic analysis via slightly different methods (e.g. DFT) and the material synthesis efforts by the Argonne NL and Max Planck Institute.<p>Farewell for now, RTSC.<p>Side-note: Pure LK-99 is visually <i>beautiful</i>!

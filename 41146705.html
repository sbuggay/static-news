Simply for the fact that it gives a very wrong picture of how well you can earn, and second - the more you earn, the HARDER the job is. Physically.<p>Your pay is directly proportional to how dangerous and demanding the job is.<p>As a student, I used to work as a longshoreman whenever needed. The pay was phenomenal - as in $500-$1000 a day. Some of the guys that worked full time would pull $10000-$15000 &#x2F; month. Everyone knew about this job, but the realty was:<p>- High paced backbreaking work 12-24 hours a day (you&#x27;d unload 20-50 kg blocks of frozen fish from the refrigeration room on large industrial trawlers)<p>- Working in really terrible conditions. Freezing cold, lots of noise, always on the lookout for falling objects.<p>The only reason I could work there, was because someone got injured - and you always had injured people there.<p>The oldest guy working there was in his mid 30s. By the time you were pushing 40, you&#x27;d be too injured or slow to work there. The lucky few were placed to operate the ship crane.<p>But the pay was good, probably the best in town as far as unskilled work goes.</div><br/></div></div><div id="41146854" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41146854" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jmclnx</span><span>|</span><a href="#41146913">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41146874">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41146854">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41146854">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That goes back to &quot;do what you like&quot;.

Moreover it likely has more to do with shaping the perception of the value of education than it does with the value or lack of it.

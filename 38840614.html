As a native Ghanaian, this was my comment on his notes on Ghana, which I posted before on HN:<p>&gt; I&#x27;d say the article omitted the animus towards Nkrumah from the UGCC (his former party). This opposition was manifested in their attempts to derail his rule from independence to his overthrow (there is some evidence they were in cahoots with the CIA et. al). Thus, the popular reactions to Nkrumah&#x27;s policies were not only based on their merits. Most Ghanaians actually think pretty well of Nkrumah&#x27;s development trajectory.<p>This opposition, which forms the basis of one of Ghana’s main political lineages, called the UP tradition, is partly tribal in motivation. The Akans (the main ethnic group, who mostly support the UP tradition) see themselves as the central core of the nation, but their allegiance is mostly to the King. They have this sense of needing to take back control of the country, similar to the way white Americans might feel threatened by a supposed loss of control to minorities. But while the Akans have a can-do attitude, they are usually not good administrators and planners.<p>So I&#x27;d say this rivalry, based on resentment of the initial success of Nkrumah’s tradition in particular, and resentment of uppity minority ethnic groups in general, is a major factor in Ghana&#x27;s perennial inability to realize its full potential.<p>This factor in Ghana&#x27;s politics continues down to this day. Rawlings’ was a Ewe, as the article notes, and his (P)NDC was the third major political lineage in Ghana (after the UP and Nkrumah’s CPP). The UP tradition was again a thorn in their flesh, even before multi-party democracy was restored. The current president (from this same political lineage) is hated by many for taking the country back to a period of massive corruption and economic malaise. I&#x27;m not too political, but I tend to agree; he gives off the air of a 70s era politician, radically unprepared to lead a 21st century country, very corrupt, intolerant of criticism, not in control of things, and afraid of a coup. Many Ghanaians would claim that he was elected primarily based on support emanating from this conflict, and not because of demonstrating any competence.</div><br/><div id="38850431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38850431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">francis36012</span><span>|</span><a href="#38849370">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38849427">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38851814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38850431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38850431">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You speak of not being political, yet your comment seems to lean in a certain direction.

Now I feel a little embarrassed looking back on this: I was trying too hard not to be wrong, and covering all of my bases in accordance.  Of course, that was sixteen years ago, and I was in high school.<p>In so doing, he buried what seems like the biggest mistake at the end: Côte d&#x27;Ivoire bled its own economy nearly to death when cacao prices collapsed in the &#x27;80s by internally subsidizing exports of its theretofore most profitable crop. Then they killed the whole industry while trying to set up a cacao OPEC, forgetting that it would be a lot easier for rich countries to just go without chocolate than to live without oil. Sure, war and corruption are bad, but plenty of countries had better performance despite them than CdI did during its long fall. In some sense, the logical comparison is Venezuela&#x27;s self-sabotaging response to the PDVSA strike of 2002 [1].<p>It&#x27;s also another case study in the enduring power of roads: for all the mistakes, CdI built the best road network in West Africa, and those roads are mostly still there, probably helping propel its recent recovery at a faster pace than its neighbors.

This way, these dictators have to send money back to the mother ship, &quot;or else&quot;; themselves getting peanuts - but at least after hedonistically partying in Paris.<p>You know that specific game mechanic if you ever played the original Dune from 1992.<p>An counterexample to this rule (that confirms its existence) is Dos Santos&#x27; daughter who exists, owns significant capital, and is a target of boring stuff such as lawsuits. This is opposed to when these billions simply disappear for good.</div><br/><div id="38851200" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38851200" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Georgelemental</span><span>|</span><a href="#38848165">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38848394">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38851200">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38851200">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Leading to suspicion that it is not &quot;looting&quot; but maybe the old colonial power using the local quasi-independent government to siphon money out of their former properties.<p>France has many other investment options with much better expected returns, especially once you account for the cost of maintaining a military presence. There is much to criticize about recent French policy in Africa, but charges that the French government is cynically enriching itself by exploiting these countries just don&#x27;t match observable reality; talking with people who have spent time working there will quickly confirm. Additional evidence comes from China&#x27;s attempts to enrich itself in Africa, which have mostly failed to produce the desired riches in the expected amounts.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38848394" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38848394" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">thriftwy</span><span>|</span><a href="#38848165">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38851200">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38848626">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38848394">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38848394">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From the same dude&#x27;s another article<p>&gt; The Balkan country was “liberated” by communists, either by the Soviet army (which didn’t give a shit about them)<p>This is measured, I presuppose, in comparsion with the Old Europe with its <i>uncanny taste</i> for all countries outside the Old Europe, though, sometimes they do devour each other as well.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38848626" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38848626" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">orenlindsey</span><span>|</span><a href="#38848165">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38848278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38848626">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38848626">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Really well written article.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38848278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38848278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">optimalsolver</span><span>|</span><a href="#38848626">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38848232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38848278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38848278">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also interesting is his Notes On The Gambia, which for some reason is the premier destination for female sex tourism:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattlakeman.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;notes-on-the-gambia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattlakeman.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;notes-on-the-gambia&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38848232" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38848232" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prmph</span><span>|</span><a href="#38848278">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38848232">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38848232">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you, yorwba, actually Matt Lakeman, the author of these &quot;notes&quot;?</div><br/><div id="38848676" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38848676" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yorwba</span><span>|</span><a href="#38848232">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38848676">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38848676">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No, I&#x27;m just subscribed to his RSS feed.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

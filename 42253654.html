Placing minimum bets when odds are in the casino&#x27;s favor.
2. Placing large bets when odds are in the player&#x27;s favor.<p>This makes the betting patterns of solo counters very different and easily identifiable from average joes.<p>Some players do try to add some variance and make intentional non-optimal plays to avoid detection. But every non-optimal play costs money and doing it too frequently eats up any potential profits.<p>Adding more decks doesn&#x27;t fully prevent advantage play. More decks aren&#x27;t harder to count. Adding more decks lowers the variance of the odds distribution through a shoe.<p>In a one-deck shoe the odds vary in a &quot;spiky&quot; way. It&#x27;s more likely to be highly favored for the casino or highly favored for the player.<p>An eight-deck shoe the odds vary in a far smoother way. Most of the time they&#x27;ll be slightly in favor of the casino or slightly in favor of the player.<p>A one-deck shoe is better for an advantage player because they can sit out when the odds are unfavorable and make very profitable bets when the odds are highly in their favor.

It takes place in 2014, at the now-demolished Riviera. At the time, the Riviera was pretty run-down, definitely one of the cheapest places on the Strip. I was in Vegas for the first and only time.<p>They had single-deck blackjack that had a unique side bet. Basically you could make additional bets that you would get dealt a natural blackjack, with a couple variations like getting an extra payout for suited blackjack.<p>This side bet was even more amenable to counting than standard BJ. The morning after I saw it, I did a quick simulation and discovered that the odds turned player-friendly if you went a single hand without seeing an ace.<p>I went down and played it. There was a crowd on Saturday night, and the deck was shuffled basically every hand. No good. Sunday morning I had the table to myself. I bet aggressively, starting with $5 min bets and going to $50 if I went two hands without an ace.<p>The dealer knew almost immediately that I was counting. He made a few snide remarks, but didn&#x27;t kick me out. No idea why not. Maybe because the side bets are usually suckers&#x27; bets, so that gave me some camouflage.<p>I had a great run of luck, doing way better than expected. In an hour or so I was up $1500. Along the way I hit a suited BJ for $250. The dealer called over the pit boss, who told him to pay me, and then side eyed me for the rest of the session. I left only because I had to get to my flight.<p>The cashier&#x27;s cage gave me a hassle about cashing in brown $500 chips. I guess they rarely got any big winners there.<p>Overall great experience for me. I&#x27;m not at all surprised they closed the casino soon after.</div><br/><div id="42260441" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42260441" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilamont</span><span>|</span><a href="#42258741">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42260037">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42261013">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42260441">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42260441">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I employed a basic counting system I learned from a book and tried it out on my first and only visit to Vegas about 20 years ago.

What&#x27;s detectable and counterable is the way to get advantage from it: you must make your bet much bigger when the count is favorable.  That behavior pattern alone is enough for a casino to choose to toss you - they don&#x27;t even have to prove that you were counting.<p>Counting works in general because the player&#x27;s advantage is concentrated into a small number of possible hands.  Almost all of your profit comes from blackjack hands paying 3:2, with a bit more from some particular cases like splitting aces and doubling on 11.  For everything else, you lose more hands than you win (the asymmetry is that if player and dealer both bust, dealer still takes your money), and you&#x27;re just trying to tread water to get to the good stuff.  The good stuff all requires aces and tens, and counting is to identify the cases when there are more of those available.<p>Besides counting, the other way to play blackjack profitably is shuffle tracking.  It&#x27;s possible to watch as aces go into the discard pile and visually track them through the shuffle.  When you know an ace is coming up soon (even within a range of the next 20 cards), bet big since even a 5% extra chance of an ace makes the expected value of that hand profitable in your favor.  Casinos also know to foil this and will eject you in the same way, for a pattern of suddenly making big bets even if they don&#x27;t necessarily know or prove you&#x27;re doing it.</div><br/><div id="42262183" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42262183" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">User23</span><span>|</span><a href="#42258741">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42259256">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42258837">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42262183">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42262183">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s also sneaky shenanigans like sitting in the right-most chair and eyeing the bottom of the shoe on shuffle.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42258837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42258837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SynasterBeiter</span><span>|</span><a href="#42258741">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42259256">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42261885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42258837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42258837">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Sort of.

One thing I thought was funny was how steven bridges was trying the fake beard thing, it seemed like the most obvious tell that he was doing some funny business to me, it looked like shit haha<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graham-kendall.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;claude-shannon-edward-thorp-roulette-and-blackjack&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graham-kendall.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;claude-shannon-edward-thorp-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edward_O._Thorp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edward_O._Thorp</a></div><br/><div id="42263645" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42263645" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matwood</span><span>|</span><a href="#42258741">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42259255">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42261885">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42263645">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42263645">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my 20s I played a lot of poker and did well, but even that is becoming more challenging.

And strip casino pit bosses don&#x27;t even care. I once personally witnessed one mocking a poor counter by calling out the count for him. And they&#x27;re right not to. The average person will be ruined with a 10% edge[1], so why should the casinos care if some tourist is managing half a percent? The counter making $600k a year at the tables is a cool story, but as I always joke when I&#x27;m at the tables, I do my real gambling with options, cards are just recreation.<p>Where they come down hard is team play. So wonging and such is going to get you backed off, if not trespassed, pretty much immediately if they catch you.<p>If you do want to try your hand at counting, I recommend starting with a simple ace&#x2F;five count[2]. It&#x27;s easy enough that you can still have fun bantering without messing it up, even after a few drinks.<p>And the other trick for being a successful grinding counter is to toke liberally. When all the employees, including the pit bosses, like having you around, it makes you considerably less likely to get backed off.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1701.01427" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1701.01427</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wizardofodds.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;blackjack&#x2F;ace-five-count&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wizardofodds.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;blackjack&#x2F;ace-five-count&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42262492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42262492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">craz8</span><span>|</span><a href="#42258741">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42262122">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42262492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42262492">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The real story of the whole of the MIT blackjack team is quite something.

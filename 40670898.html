It&#x27;s been many years, but I still remember a number of the challenges. SPE&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have shared memory access to RAM, so data transfer was your problem to solve as a developer, and each SPE had 256k of RAM. These things were very fast for the day, so they&#x27;d crunch through the data very quickly. We double-buffered the RAM, using about 100k for data, while simultaneously using the other 100k as a read buffer for the DMA engine.<p>That was the trickiest part - getting the data in and out of the thing. You had 6 SPE&#x27;s available to you, 2 were reserved by the OS, and keeping them all filled was a challenge because it required nearly optimal usage of the DMA engine. Memory access was slow, something over 1000 cycles from issuing the DMA until data started coming in.<p>Back then, C++ was all the rage and people did their various C++ patterns, but due to the instruction size being so limited, we just hand-wrote some code to run on the SPU&#x27;s which didn&#x27;t match the rest of the engine, so it ended up gluing together two dissimilar codebases.<p>I both miss the cleverness required back then, but also don&#x27;t miss the complexity.

IBM provided the bulk of the manpower, with the design team headquartered at its Austin, Texas, offices. Sony and Toshiba sent teams of engineers to Austin to live and work with their partners in an effort to have the Cell ready for the Playstation 3&#x27;s target launch, Christmas 2005.<p>But a funny thing happened along the way: A new &quot;partner&quot; entered the picture. In late 2002, Microsoft approached IBM about making the chip for Microsoft&#x27;s rival game console, the (as yet unnamed) Xbox 360. In 2003, IBM&#x27;s Adam Bennett showed Microsoft specs for the still-in-development Cell core. Microsoft was interested and contracted with IBM for their own chip, to be built around the core that IBM was still building with Sony.<p>All three of the original partners had agreed that IBM would eventually sell the Cell to other clients. But it does not seem to have occurred to Sony that IBM would sell key parts of the Cell before it was complete and to Sony&#x27;s primary video-game console competitor. The result was that Sony&#x27;s R&amp;D money was spent creating a component for Microsoft to use against it.&quot;<p>( From the WSJ )<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20150129121858&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;SB123069467545545011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20150129121858&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.co...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40675677" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40675677" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrkramer</span><span>|</span><a href="#40674854">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40675157">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40676084">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40677795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40675677">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40675677">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Yes, for much of it&#x27;s lifetime it was behind the 360 in worldwide sales, and might have been a disappointment for Sony, especially after the PS2 domination, but I wouldn&#x27;t call say it &quot;Lost Handily&quot; to the xbox360.

Not quite as dramatic as Nintendo with the market loss from SNES to the N64, but I’m sure Sony had a lot of similar conversations. You also have to consider that Xbox was the distant third place console in the previous generation, so barely losing to Sony at the last minute was definitely considered a huge success. Especially after the disaster that was the RROD.

As far as I know that&#x27;s pretty much it for its branch of the CPU family tree.<p>Meanwhile - and I admittedly know less about this - as I understand it the PowerPC is ultimately descended from the IBM 801, which was a high-end workstation and server chip. There might&#x27;ve been some influence from Motorola, and Motorola made the 6800 - the 6502&#x27;s father - so in that sense the 6502 and the PowerPC might be very distant cousins.

Internal communication was not a strong suit at LANL... You also had a ton of different teams who all got access to the hardware at roughly the same time and were shotgunning different approaches and coalescing on the better libraries wasn&#x27;t really a priority at the beginning of roadrunner when I was there. LANL didn&#x27;t really have project management at the code base level to direct people to upgrade stuff like that, its mostly independent researchers pulling the code bases in different directions. Most of those researchers were physicists in my world and didn&#x27;t really care about the &quot;engineering&quot; of software, just that their code ran fast and correct enough to get to the next deadline. Then there is a small core of more computer science researchers who did projects like this. If they were successful enough they&#x27;d attempt to integrate it into the mainline codes. But their incentives generally were to publish papers about super computer code like this, not necessarily to integrate it into the mainline codes. So often getting something like this in the codes was giving a talk and hoping a physicist would see it and need the extra performance for their needs.<p>I was not running codes that would utilize even a small fraction of roadrunner so my projects quickly moved to the GPU based test beds for the next gen computer so I didn&#x27;t get to see these research coalesce. My understanding from people who stayed on roadrunner is that for the most part people didn&#x27;t adopt too much fanciness for roadrunner as the rewrites were too deep and GPUs were on the horizon. There was a lot of vision about making generic heterogeneous compute frameworks but too my knowledge they didn&#x27;t pan out and just writing against CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI won the day.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="40671695" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40671695" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wmf</span><span>|</span><a href="#40671232">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40671457">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40672532">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40671695">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40671695">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FLOPS are easy; programming is hard.

No lazy ports ( I still get pissy sometimes over ps3 dragon age port ). Exclusives had to be good or at least showcase what the console could do.<p>So is that what makes Cell infamous?

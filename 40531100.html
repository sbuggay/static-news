I&#x27;m not in Antartica, I&#x27;m in Beijing, but still struggle with the internet. Being behind the great firewall means using creative approaches. VPNs only sometimes work, and each leaves a signature that the firewall&#x27;s hueristics and ML can eventually catch onto. Even state-mandated ones are &#x27;gently&#x27; limited at times of political sensitivity. It all ends up meaning that, even if I get a connection, it&#x27;s not stable, and it&#x27;s so painful to sink precious packets into pointless web-app-react-crap roundtrips.<p>I feel like some devs need to time-travel back to 2005 or something and develop for that era in order to learn how to build things nimbly. In deficit of time travel, if people could just learn to open web tools and use its throttling tool: turn it to 3g, and see if their webapp is resilient.

It’s not necessarily easy to do, and there is almost no online resources that you can base your projects on if you’re a Google&#x2F;GPT programmer. Part of this is because of the ocean of terrible JS resources online, but a big part of it is also that the organisations which work like this aren’t sharing.

You don&#x27;t need to be online to read messages you have, or to write messages to be sent whenever you&#x27;re online. Email used to work like this for everyone; and it was no big deal to grab mail once in a while, read it and reply, and then send in a batch. Online messaging is great, if you can, but for things like being on a commuter train where connectivity ebbs and flows, it&#x27;s nice to pick up messages when you can.<p>a) hardcode fallback ips for <i>when</i> DNS doesn&#x27;t work (not if)<p>b) setup &quot;0rtt&quot; fast resume, so you can start getting messages on the second round trip. This is part of noise pipes or whatever they&#x27;re called, and tls 1.3<p>c) do reasonable-ish things to work with MTU. In the old days, FreeBSD reflected the client MSS back to it, which helps when there&#x27;s a tunnel like PPPoE and it only modifies outgoing syns and not incoming syn+ack. Linux never did that, and afaik, FreeBSD took it out. Behind Facebook infrastructure, they just hardcode the mss for i think 1480 MTU (you can&#x2F;should check with tcpdump). I did some limited testing, and really the best results come from monitoring for &#x2F;24&#x27;s with bad behavior (it&#x27;s pretty easy, if you look for it --- never got any large packets and packet gaps are a multiple of MSS - space for tcp timestamps) and then sending back client - 20 to those; you could also just always send back client - 20. I think Android finally started doing pMTUD blackhole detection stuff a couple years back, Apple has been doing it really well for longer. Path MTU Discovery is still an issue, and anything you can do to make it happier is good.<p>d) connect in the background to exchange messages when possible. Don&#x27;t post notifications unless the message content is on the device. Don&#x27;t be one of those apps that can only load messsages from the network when the app is in the foreground, because the user might not have connectivity then<p>e) prioritize messages over telemetry. Don&#x27;t measure everything, only measure things when you know what you&#x27;ll do with the numbers. Everybody hates telemetry, but it can be super useful as a developer. But if you&#x27;ve got giant telemetry packs to upload, that&#x27;s bad by itself, and if you do them before you get messages in and out, you&#x27;re failing the user.<p>f) pay attention to how big things are on the wire. Not everything needs to get shrunk as much as possible, but login needs to be very tight, and message sending should be too. IMHO, http and json and xml are too bulky for those, but are ok for multimedia because the payload is big so framing doesn&#x27;t matter as much, and they&#x27;re ok for low volume services because they&#x27;re low volume.</div><br/><div id="40532272" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532272" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cheema33</span><span>|</span><a href="#40531562">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532502">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532272">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532272">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I used to work at WhatsApp..<p>Do you know why there is a 4 device limit?

In connection-oriented protocols like TCP this means slowness induced by drop of packets, and in fire-and-forget protocols like UDP this means your messages don&#x27;t get through. This means that slowness might take multiple forms, such as low data rates or moments of high throughput followed by momentary connection drops.<p>One solid approach to deal with slow networks is supporting offline mode, where all data pushes and pulls are designed as transactions that take place asynchronously, and data pushes are cached locally to be retried whenever possible. This brings additional requirements such as systems having to support versioning and conflict resolution.<p>Naturally, these requirements permeate onto additional UI requirements, such as support for manually synching&#x2F;refreshing, displaying network status, toggling actions that are meaningless when the network is down, rely on eager loading to remain usable while offline, etc.</div><br/><div id="40531944" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531944" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kbr2000</span><span>|</span><a href="#40531412">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531744">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531893">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531944">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531944">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Delay&#x2F;disruption tolerant networking (DTN) seeks to address these kind of problems, using alternative techniques and protocols: store-and-forward, Bundle protocols and Licklider Transmission Protocol.

The current Braid specification extends HTTP with two dimensions of synchronization:

  Level 0: Today&#x27;s HTTP
  Level 1: Subscriptions with Push Updates
  Level 2: P2P Consistency (Patches, Versions, Merges)

  Even though today&#x27;s synchronizers use different protocols, their network messages convey the same types of information: versions in time, locations in space, and patches to regions of space across spans of time. The composition of any set of patches forms a mathematical structure called a braid—the forks, mergers, and re-orderings of space over time.

Now mobile connections are way, way faster than physical connections in the 90&#x27;s but web pages aren&#x27;t few KB, they are few MB at minimum.<p>It takes four seconds and 2.5 MB to load my local meteorological institute&#x27;s weather page which changes not more often than maybe once an hour and could be cached and served as a static base page in a few dozen milliseconds (i.e. instantly). A modern connection that&#x27;s plenty capable to support all my remote work and development over a VPN and interactive shells without any lag can&#x27;t help me get modern web pages load any faster because of the amount of data and the required processing&#x2F;execution of a million lines of javascript that&#x27;s imported from a bunch of number of sources, with the appropriate handshake delays of new connections implied, for each page load.<p>A weather page from 2004 served exactly the same information as a weather page from 2024, and that information is everything required to get a sufficient glimpse of today&#x27;s weather. One web page could be fixed but there are billions of URIs that load poorly. The overall user experience hasn&#x27;t improved much, if at all. Yes, you can stream 4K video without any problems which reveals how fast things actually are today but you won&#x27;t see it when browsing common pages -- I&#x27;d actually like to say web pages have only gone slower despite the improvements in bandwidth and processing power.<p>When many pages still had mobile versions it was occasionally a very welcome alternative. Either the mobile version was so crappy you wanted to use the desktop version on your phone, or it was so good you wanted to predominantly load the mobile version even on desktop.<p>I&#x27;d love to see an information internet where things like weather data, news articles, forum posts, etc. would be downloadable as snippets of plaintext, presumably intended to be machine readable, and &quot;web&quot; would actually be a www site that builds a presentation and UI for loading and viewing these snippets. You could use whichever &quot;web&quot; you want but you would still ultimately see the same information. This would disconnect information sources from the presentation which I think is the reason web sites started considering &quot;browser&quot; a programmable platform, thus taking away user control and each site bloating their pages each individually, leaving no choice for the user but maybe some 3rd party monkeyscripts or forced CSS rules.<p>If the end user could always choose the presentation, the user would be greatly empowered in comparison to the current state of affairs where web users are currently being tamed down to be mere receivers or consumers of information, much not unlike passive TV viewers.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40531896" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531896" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">parentheses</span><span>|</span><a href="#40532428">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531896">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531896">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I recall using a device called the &quot;Mini Maxwell&quot; by this company:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwl.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwl.com&#x2F;</a><p>It enabled you to simulate network slow-downs, packet-loss, packet corruption, packet reordering and more.

We&#x27;d need to be able to turn off most images or visual elements to focus purely on the elements and their functionality, except for cases where displaying an image is critical for the function (and even then give the choice of showing a low quality version with a smaller file size). Things like web safe fonts that are already present in the browser&#x2F;OS, most likely no libraries like React or Vue either (maybe Preact or Svelte).<p>We&#x27;d need to allow for really long request (say, fetch) timeout values, maybe even to choose how to set them based on the connection quality (if a user has a really fast connection but a request suddenly hangs and is taking upwards of a minute, something has probably gone wrong and it&#x27;d make sense to fail that request, vs a user in a remote area for whom all requests are similarly slow), assuming that the server doesn&#x27;t mind connections that linger around for a long time at slow speeds.<p>We&#x27;d also need to allow for configuring an arbitrary HTTP cache&#x2F;proxy for any site visited and file requested (say, store up to 1 TB on some local server based on file hashes and return the same for any user that requests that), but obviously things don&#x27;t usually work that way over privacy&#x2F;security concerns (nowadays different sites even download duplicate copies of the same files due to changes in the browsers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peakhour.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cache-partitioning-firefox-chrome&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peakhour.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cache-partitioning-firefox-chro...</a> ). Maybe even for any web request that the OS might want to do, like system updates, basically a full on MitM for the whole system.<p>Speaking of which, no more Electron or large software packages. Only native software with like Win32&#x2F;WPF or maybe something like GTK&#x2F;Qt, but nowadays it seems like even phone apps, not just desktop software, often don&#x27;t use the system GUI frameworks, but instead ship a bunch of visual fluff, which might look nice and work well, but also takes up a bunch of space.<p>I don&#x27;t think there are incentives out there to guide us towards a world like that, which doesn&#x27;t quite make sense to me. Lightweight websites should lead to better customer&#x2F;user retention, but in practice that doesn&#x27;t seem like something that anyone is optimizing for - ads everywhere, numerous tracking scripts, even autoplay videos, for everything from news sites to e-commerce shops.<p>People who do optimize for that sort of stuff, seem to be a part of a smaller niche enthusiast community (which is still nice to see), like:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1mb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;1mb.club&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;512kb.club&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;512kb.club&#x2F;</a><p>Admittedly, even I&#x27;m guilty of bloating my homepage size from ~150 KB to ~ 600 KB due to wanting to use a custom set of fonts (that I host myself), even WOFF2 didn&#x27;t save me there.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40532146" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532146" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">finack</span><span>|</span><a href="#40531937">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531748">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532146">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532146">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Step 1: don&#x27;t use tens of megabytes of JavaScript to render some rectangles.<p>Step 2: stop using MacBooks from 2047 to develop websites.<p>Step 3: hire people who can write vanilla HTML.</div><br/><div id="40532200" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532200" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kylehotchkiss</span><span>|</span><a href="#40532146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532214">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532200">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532200">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Step 4: audit whatever code ChatGPT wrote for you for performance impact</div><br/></div></div><div id="40532214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40532214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">The_Colonel</span><span>|</span><a href="#40532146">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40532200">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40531748">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40532214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40532214">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Step 0: read the article before commenting</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40531748" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40531748" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">self_awareness</span><span>|</span><a href="#40532146">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40531748">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40531748">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What are the hopes for &quot;engineering for slow internet&quot; to happen, when people have engineered applications for &quot;fast internet&quot; when all we had was &quot;slow internet&quot;.<p>Nice thought in theory but unnecessarily gives false hope.<p>Confluence&#x2F;Jira sometimes need to download <i>20 megabytes</i> in order to show a page with only text and some icons.

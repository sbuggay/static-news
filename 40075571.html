We are replacing many pipetting steps with electric and magnetic manipulation of samples on a surface.<p>Traditionally these operations when done manually (or even on other automation) are done inside tubes. When these operations are carried out inside tubes you have many limitations: you end up using a lot of tips, when pipetting manually some workflows require special techniques to pipette handle the samples. These operations are also extremely painful when do them over and over again -- very tedious and very easy to make a mistake.<p>Yes we have seen increase in throughputs relative to human. Most humans (often) process samples in batches of 8 &#x2F; 12 samples. To give you a sense of the length of the workflow in a lab it can range from two hours to two days. The Callisto system can process anywhere from 1 - 24 samples for many workflows and is software controlled. It not only eliminates the manual steps: it provides at least 3X the throughput with 15 mins setup time, provides reproducible results and improves quality.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40078599" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40078599" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">_ihaque</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076398">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40081638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40078599">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40078599">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hi Udayan - nice to see another shot at electrowetting microfluidics in this space.<p>1. How does your technology or product offering distinguish itself from prior attempts like NeoPrep (née Advanced Liquid Logic) from Illumina or Voltrax from ONT?<p>2. How &quot;hackable&quot; is the offering for power users to implement custom protocols on the instrument and consumables?</div><br/><div id="40081010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40081010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">perceptron</span><span>|</span><a href="#40078599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40080802">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40081010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40081010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In response to your first question, there are notable differences between the NeoPrep and Callisto, and between Voltrax and Callisto.<p>NeoPrep &#x2F; Voltrax vs Callisto:<p>- NeoPrep and Voltrax primarily use electrowetting to manipulate samples and droplets. In contrast, Volta Labs&#x27; Callisto uses electrowetting where appropriate and employs other traditional and non-traditional technologies for different droplet manipulation operations. For instance (in the linked video), we demonstrate the use of a standard pipettor for transferring liquids from tubes on the electrowetting surface in our video.<p>- While NeoPrep and Voltrax have limitations in certain workflow capabilities compared to Callisto, they also surpass Callisto in other aspects. For example, they have lower throughput and lack batch level flexibility. Unlike the Volta Callisto system, these two systems cannot process raw samples such as blood, saliva, or cells. However, the Volta Callisto system can extract DNA&#x2F;RNA from raw biological samples, including blood and saliva. On the contrary both the Voltrax and NeoPrep systems can perform onboard&#x2F;on-chip PCR and measure DNA quantities using optical sensors, capabilities that the Volta Callisto system currently lacks.<p>- The NeoPrep system used a PCB cartridge which had significant robustness issues, and the entire PCB was disposable. Similarly, the Voltrax system&#x27;s LCD display is disposable after each run. On the other hand, the Callisto system uses a simple plastic component as the disposable.<p>- User interaction with NeoPrep and Voltrax can be quite messy, requiring users to fill oil through channels and dispense reagents&#x2F;samples through small holes. The Callisto system, however, accepts standard tubes as inputs and outputs, eliminating the need for users to learn new techniques for loading&#x2F;unloading samples into the system.</div><br/></div></div><div id="40080802" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40080802" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">perceptron</span><span>|</span><a href="#40078599">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40081010">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40081638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40080802">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40080802">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great questions actually.

We have a rigorous validation plan for ensuring that the applications on the platform perform robustly. We also operate in an industry where the standards are very high and samples being processed are previous and there are no excuses for failures. Moreover we have deployed with several customers in 2023, results of which have been showcased at premier genomics conference like AGBT. They are all published on our website here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltalabs.com&#x2F;resources">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltalabs.com&#x2F;resources</a><p>2. Some technical limitations of the platform include its inability to do PCR or onboard implication, there are also limitations on range of volumes we can work with. We plan to address these in the future.<p>3. Our system actually leverages an advanced form of electrowetting, magnetic manipulation of samples and thermal control in combination with liquid transfer technologies like pipettors. Our roadmap includes advancing all of these underlying technologies: for example being able to go to higher or lower temperatures. If you also think about the declining cost of sequencing, the cost of sample prep needs to go down relative to the cost of sequencing: we are going to advance the technology to drive the cost curve down. We might potentially expand into other applications beyond sequencing: those include synthetic biology, proteomics to name a couple.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="40076974" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40076974" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">waiquoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#40081638">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40078123">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40076974">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40076974">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How does your technology compare to Nuclera&#x27;s chip based system?<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuclera.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nuclera.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="40078123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40078123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Vt71fcAqt7</span><span>|</span><a href="#40076974">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#40081470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40078123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40078123">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">So this would be a step before feeding the outputs to something like one of illumina&#x27;s machines?</div><br/><div id="40079502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40079502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">perceptron</span><span>|</span><a href="#40078123">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40081470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40079502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40079502">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hello!

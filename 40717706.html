Probably like how we may all know Eisenhower as the face of D-Day, who yes, played a big role, but none of us probably know the name of the guy on his staff who handled every excruciating detail of the logistics of it all (which is probably one of the most impressive parts of D-Day).<p>Addition: Also sort of like how everyone knows Edison as the man behind the light bulb, but not very many people can name the people on Edison&#x27;s team that helped with the light bulb.</div><br/><div id="40736408" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-40736408" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ricksunny</span><span>|</span><a href="#40731554">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#40733010">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#40736010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-40736408">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-40736408">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I like this and agree:<p>&gt;Bush was preferred to be glue behind the scenes for the most part.<p>re. associating with something like Edison does the light bulb, I ageee there&#x27;s probably a lot to that.

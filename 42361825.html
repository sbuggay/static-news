Looks to me like the build quality would make an even larger difference to the success of the device.

This ignores all inertia of the arbor and motor rotor, mind, which is possibly significant (smaller radius but dense), Say it spins at 4000rpm, or 420 rad&#x2F;s (some saws go to 6000 plus and this is quadratic).<p>So kinetic energy in the blade alone is 1&#x2F;2Iw², or 0.5 * 0.03 * 420², or 2.6kJ. For comparison, a rifle bullet is about that, which seems right on the face of it.<p>So to remove that energy in 5ms (SawStop&#x27;s claim) is 520kW, or a current of 2000A at 240V, or 4000A at 120V.<p>This is not completely technically impossible to deliver - you need about 200 0.1 farad capacitors charged to 250V, which are 100mm is diameter and 250mm tall each, so a fridge-sized box. Actually pushing 2000A into a motor winding for 5ms isn&#x27;t actually that easy as it&#x27;s a canonical example of an inductive load, so you need even more, plus hopefully a way to stop the current when done before turning the inside of the motor into a plasma ball. Evaporating the motor winding before you&#x27;ve stopped the blade is no good, so you&#x27;ll need to uprate the coils massively, which will make the motor very heavy and very expensive.<p>So, you won&#x27;t break physics to do this, but it will be large, heavy and expensive.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42363895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42363895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MaxikCZ</span><span>|</span><a href="#42363886">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42364260">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42364101">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42363895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42363895">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My guess the stopping will happen in comparable time it takes to start it.

As an example, many appliances will warn that you can never operate them with the covers off and doing so can cause death or serious injury. Okay fine, sure, it&#x27;s not necessarily safe, and perhaps you could indeed kill yourself by accident doing so. However, in practice it&#x27;s bullshit. People do this all the time, and you pretty much have to sometimes. How the hell are you even supposed to troubleshoot without being able to see what&#x27;s wrong? Just guess?<p>So sometimes when it comes to warnings it&#x27;s easy to empathize with the person who didn&#x27;t take them very seriously, as we&#x27;re pretty much conditioned to take warnings like this with a grain of salt.<p>Though honestly, when it comes to using a table saw, the thing I&#x27;m actually afraid of is kickback.

I&#x27;m in agreement.<p>But I don&#x27;t think that companies are trying to make the tools more expensive. In fact, it was the opposite. SawStop sold high-end saws, other manufacturers did not want to adopt the technology because of the cost it added.<p>The issue of proper saw safety and use of sawstop technology are two different issues, I believe. And while I agree, the proper safety procedures you cite should be used by everyone, they aren&#x27;t. In fact, they often aren&#x27;t. And we can sit here and shake our fingers, but it won&#x27;t change the overall culture around them. And I think that&#x27;s the conclusion that regulators have come to as well: They&#x27;re not going to get people to always use their blade guards or count to 10, so they&#x27;ll mandate adoption of a technology that mitigates the risk due to people not following directions.<p>Regarding the licensing, I think that&#x27;s been addressed by others elsewhere. But in short, SawStop defended their patents in order to license the tech. When the government moved to mandate it, SawStop said they wouldn&#x27;t enforce their patent, but they&#x27;re not handing the tech over either. Other companies are free to develop their own method without running afoul of SawStop&#x27;s patents, or they can license SawStop&#x27;s tech. To me, it seems like a fair approach that both protects their investment while not putting themselves in a morally questionable position in taking advantage of the upcoming regulation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42362518" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42362518" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Blackthorn</span><span>|</span><a href="#42362487">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42363639">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42362641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42362518">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42362518">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be fair, other companies haven&#x27;t been trying very hard.

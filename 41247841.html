All of that takes time, but it moves your expected outcomes from, say, 95% to 99%.<p>In the case described, the expected outcome is 0% - it&#x27;s a fucking catastrophe, there&#x27;s 250 people on their way, and everyone who comes in is a corpse waiting to happen. At that point, absolutely, flow is king - hitting an expected outcome of even 50% (looks like they got somewhere around 65%) is a massive upgrade, so yeah, shove as many people through the CT scan bay as you can, let your radiologist flip a coin, and if the nurse gives the wrong drug, fuck it, that&#x27;s probably not what killed the patient - move on and hope you do better next time.<p>I think the real takeaway here is recognizing what the stakes of your situation are and acting accordingly - what are the outcomes that matter, and what&#x27;s the set of activities that get you closer to your desired ones. Sometimes that&#x27;s care and caution, and sometimes that&#x27;s taking your best guess, committing to it, and accepting the outcomes.<p>Huge kudos to the author and to whoever set up the system that enabled them to act as needed and supported them in doing so, though - I&#x27;m sure they broke every regulation in the book over the course of those six hours. Plenty of other disasters have been made much worse by the lack of flexibility in a system to recognize extreme circumstances and act accordingly.<p>(* take &quot;good&quot; with all the caveats you want here.

I always sort of wonder why Sears did not become what amazon is, They already had the infrastructure for it. my best guess, unable to shift mediums fast enough?<p>While looking for sources to this story(I could not find any, sorry) I did find a claim that bezos was pivotal for a 1992 ruling that no sales tax was due for orders that originated outside the state. and this was critical for amazons early success. I worked for a mail-order company when that ruling was overturned. And it was a mess, I was not in accounting so I have no idea what it did financially, but all of a sudden all the software went from having to handle (in state collect tax, out of state no tax) to (every state, county, city and their dog charges a different tax and now you have to try to figure out what this is and collect it).</div><br/><div id="41253336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41253336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">trustinmenowpls</span><span>|</span><a href="#41248752">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41252612">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41248814">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41253336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41253336">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought that law only required you to collect state tax, if you were out of state, local taxes were still exempt unless you had an actual business in that state.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="41248814" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41248814" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lostlogin</span><span>|</span><a href="#41248752">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41249601">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41250415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41248814">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41248814">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Some of this can be applied to normal day-to-day running, outside of a crisis.</div><br/><div id="41249480" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41249480" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sseagull</span><span>|</span><a href="#41248752">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#41248814">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41250415">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41249480">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41249480">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the overall takeaway in “Turn the Ship Around!” by David Marquet (although there is lots more to it)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="41250415" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-41250415" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ThrowawayR2</span><span>|</span><a href="#41248752">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#41248814">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#41249994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-41250415">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-41250415">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Giving people freedom to do their jobs is how we got the Crowdstrike incident.

In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital &amp; Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System. Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients, 150 of whom arrived within about 40 minutes.[80] University Medical Center treated 104 patients. Additionally, six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two. Many victims of the shooting required blood transfusions, which totaled 499 components in the first 24 hours of treatment. This blood was rapidly replaced by available blood from local and national blood banks.<p>&gt;University Medical Center, the Level I trauma center in Las Vegas, was difficult to access for the more than 50 percent of patients transported by private vehicles because Interstate 15, the most direct route from the shooting location, was closed to the public. Also, an erroneous emergency services announcement made one hour after the shooting reported UMC had reached capacity and was on diversion.

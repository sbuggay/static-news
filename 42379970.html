These kind of companies ask you to give 100% of yourself every single day.</i><p>No, I understand can understand how someone would come away with that conclusion based on common patterns in the industry, but I think you&#x27;re conflating two things.<p>First, companies want teams that deliver value.  If evaluation is based more on vibes than actual output, that&#x27;s a management failure.  Its nuanced, because bad vibes can really hurt teams a lot, so it&#x27;s not that vibes don&#x27;t matter, but if the source of the vibes is that management is clueless and doesn&#x27;t understand the pain points on the front lines, then that&#x27;s the bigger issue.  As a junior engineer it can be hard to distinguish, but just understand that good management exists and is out there, it&#x27;s not all pointy hairs (even if the language is sometimes the same, after all pointy hairs have to cargo cult off of someone).<p>Second is how much a company asks of you.  Once you rise up the ranks in any sizable company you&#x27;ll realize an incredible amount of effort is wasted just due to the overhead of coordinating many individuals.  In these types of environments it&#x27;s more about focusing on the right things rather than overall effort.  As Steve Jobs said, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to to , We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do&quot;.  Entire teams can be net negative because no one calls out the elephant in the room.  While it&#x27;s true, that if you are successful in a high performance org, more will be asked of you, it&#x27;s also true that good leaders value solid contributors even when they set some boundaries.<p>So there are really two strategies in a large org: one is to do the bare minimum and keep your head down, in that case avoiding high performing orgs is probably a good idea. But at the end of the day your entire job and career is at the mercy of the beancounters waking up one day and realizing you are dead weight.  Alternatively, you can adopt a growth mentality, do your best every day, and see where it takes you.  The latter path does mean you might need to set some boundaries and say no to people at times.  Sure it&#x27;s awkward, but in the grand scheme of things this builds a stronger network and sets you up for long-term success far better than playing defense because you see the employer-employee relationship as fundamentally adversarial.  I think that worldview makes sense from a physical labor workforce, but it&#x27;s really self-defeating for software engineers because at the end of the day our output is what our code does (hence every IC is &quot;managing&quot; the tech output), not how much time we put in creating it.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42385914" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42385914" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">portaouflop</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380861">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42381967">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42383161">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382125">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42385914">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42385914">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’d rather take vibes based than some artificial productivity measure.

The value of their good vibes declines as the consequences of their low output and&#x2F;or poor code quality accumulate on the team&#x27;s shoulders.<p>You also see this a lot when vetting employee referrals. A lot of people will enthusiastically refer friends and people they like being around, but who are not necessarily great contributors. These people seek referrals at a disproportional rate because, well, they tend to be laid off more frequently and might struggle to get through job interviews through normal channels.<p>Employees will refer this people because they want them around, but once you start communicating to people that referrals are equivalent to personally vouching for their referral&#x27;s abilities, half of the time they start walking back referrals or saying that the person needs a good manager and so on.<p>So agree that relationships matter, but it&#x27;s going to be hard to build a career on relationships alone.

For everyone&#x27;s favorite example, if you are thrown some Perl, learn enough perl that you won&#x27;t be the person whining about line noise. Not &quot;everything&quot; about perl, just enough for the task at hand (then more for the next one).

I just pull on the threads that interest me, and over time these threads always have a way of coming back together. It&#x27;s the difference between being goal oriented and process oriented. This is a much slower, much longer arc to building your taste, skills, and reaching some semblance of your abstract goals, but the other way just wasn&#x27;t fun to me.<p>When I was in undergrad I remember reading a lot of blogs and hoping to live up to their idealistic views (shoutout pg), because I hadn&#x27;t quite yet identified what career I wanted to lead. I dropped out, and then around 24&#x2F;25 the desire for those goals really shattered. I pursued a very self-directed path that has thankfully worked out (so far-still ample time for it to falter).

It feels good, like you&#x27;re learning something new, improving yourself. But at the end-of-the day you aren&#x27;t. Your brain is just sitting there passively - not really doing any hard work. Instead of your brain generating ideas and solving problems, that process has been palmed off to the internet.</div><br/><div id="42382026" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42382026" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bityard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380616">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42380992">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42382026">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42382026">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Heh, well yes and no.<p>I feel like if you are the kind of person who builds or fixes things, there are certain topics that could be worth watching in your free time because they let you look over the shoulders of experts to grain some general understanding that you might not otherwise get exposed to.<p>For example, I watch a channel run by a guy who repairs cars for a living because he&#x27;s entertaining to watch, not because I want to be a mechanic. Watching his channel is MOSTLY entertainment for me but after years of watching, I have learned enough about car maintenance that I&#x27;d would feel comfortable at least attempting a wide variety of repairs on my own cars that I would have never even considered attempting otherwise.<p>Often these videos lead ideas or projects that I have implemented in real life. I build a bandsaw out of wood, for example. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bityard.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019&#x2F;January&#x2F;i-built-a-bandsaw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bityard.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2019&#x2F;January&#x2F;i-built-a-ban...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="42380992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42380992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gspencley</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380616">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382026">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42381205">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42380992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42380992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the flip side, I do think that passively consuming &quot;edu-tainment&quot; content is better than consuming, say, fictional sitcoms or dramas that are intended to appeal to the masses. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with consuming &quot;mindless&quot; entertainment either, just that in a conversation about productivity vs non-productivity and &quot;consumption&quot;&#x27;s effects on it, I think it&#x27;s fair to rank the content in question.<p>I watch a ridiculous amount of this type of content. As a &quot;maker&quot; myself, I get inspired by watching other people make stuff .. and I pick up a few tips and tricks along the way too.<p>But, the trap here that a lot in the comments seem in-tune with, is the trap of deluding yourself into thinking that you&#x27;re being productive by consuming content ... as opposed to, well, producing stuff.<p>My wife and I are part time performing magicians, and when it comes to our magic act we fall into this trap a LOT. Because I make good money as a software engineer, I wanted to create for us a &quot;library&quot; where no matter what we want to write or create we will have resources that will empower us with method possibilities. Sounds great on paper, until we look back on what we accomplished in the past weeks and all we can come up with &quot;Well, we read a bunch of books... and some are super expensive and hard to find out of print magic books that only have &lt; 1,000 known copies in existence ... does that count?&quot;<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. Some of the most innovative inventions and artistic creations have been borne from scarcity and limitations. An over-abundance of information is not necessarily bad it&#x27;s just that we tend, as humans, to find ways to trick ourselves into thinking we&#x27;re accomplishing something when we&#x27;re really being passive.<p>To circle back to my original point, while watching &quot;edu-tainment&quot; content on YouTube is still being passive, at least there is the capacity to gain high-level knowledge that can give you a head&#x27;s start when you&#x27;re ready to actually start diving into doing something.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42381205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42381205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">strangattractor</span><span>|</span><a href="#42380616">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42382308">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42381205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42381205">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep - I am writing a HN comment instead of doing my work at this very moment.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42382308" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42382308" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">agentultra</span><span>|</span><a href="#42381205">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42381934">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42382308">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42382308">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also hard to disconnect when these content sites make money from you staying glued.

I’m training for a marathon with some friends and some are already making excuses to do as much as possible that _does not_ involve running (weight lifting, biking).

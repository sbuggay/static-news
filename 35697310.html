Hence why I think outrage, politics and whatnot gets promoted more often. It leaves content that isn&#x27;t popular in the dust, and causes people to modify their behaviour and content to optimise for the algorithm unfortunately—I personally think it&#x27;s a broken system insofar as it&#x27;s optimising for engagement rather than curation.<p>Somewhat related, but I&#x27;ve been using Plex&#x27;s Sonic Analysis[1] and it&#x27;s been great at recommending tracks in my library (large but not spotify huge), much better than the streaming services, which often would recommend popular non-independent content over gems.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot; but it works—ideally services ought to let users easily tweak how content is curated for them<p>&gt;The Musical Universe consists of points in N-dimensional space. But what’s important is that this allows us to see how “close” anything in your library is from anything else, where distance is based on a large number of sonic elements in the audio.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.plex.tv&#x2F;articles&#x2F;sonic-analysis-music&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.plex.tv&#x2F;articles&#x2F;sonic-analysis-music&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="35722515" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35722515" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">charcircuit</span><span>|</span><a href="#35721315">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35723102">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35722515">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35722515">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;over the actual content<p>The content are features to the ranking models.

But what I really want is an algorithmic feed option (option being important, obviously) on mastodon!<p>If someone that I have been interacting with a lot had a popular post in the last 12 hours that I have not seen, and I have just refreshed the feed, I would love for that to be near the top.<p>That is just one simple user story but I can imagine a wide selection of options - controllable percentage of popular posts from the rest of your server or the fediverse. Controllable percentage of posts marked important by my server admin. Controllable percentage of popular posts that people I am following have liked, even if I am not following the person.<p>People really misdirect their grief when they say the problem is algorithms. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really true! We all have trauma and bad memories from corporate-controlled algorithm, because that algorithm serves the needs of the corporation. Users get turned in to products to serve a for-profit system that sees us as tools to be used to extract value. And we all see those algorithms and think: &quot;algorithms suck!&quot; Then people make systems like mastodon with no algorithm at all - no option for one - and people bristle at the idea of an algorithm there even if it is optional. But of course it would be optional, it&#x27;s mastodon!<p>Imagine if users had a complex panel (with a few easy pre-sets to try) for various tunings to the algorithm. I genuinely believe it would make mastodon much more useful to a lot of people. I still use both twitter and mastodon and one thing that is clear is that it is very easy to see popular posts from my friends on twitter. Unfortunately there is a lot to dislike about twitter, which is why I want to see people change their thinking - what we need are algorithms we control! Open source algorithms with lots of optional tuning and adjustment and always the ability to disable it completely.<p>There is some discussion of some of these features in the mastodon issues page.

Perhaps there are some replies I don&#x27;t see, but I suppose then I would not know this.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve heard the protocol is too inefficient to support receiving everything.<p>This may limit some algorithmic features, but not everything. Servers could specifically make accessible their most popular posts of the day from users who consent to this in their settings. I could choose to subscribe to this list to be optionally sprinkled in to my algorithmic feed. I don&#x27;t need to see every post on the fediverse for this to work. A good heuristic would be to subscribe to popular posts from every server that hosts one person I follow, and their could be some convenience function to select those servers for me. If I find that some servers are producing posts I don&#x27;t care about, I could unsubscribe from that server in a little option under the algorithmically selected post.<p>I may only want to see popular posts from something like 20 servers, and I might only want to see the top ten most popular posts from them each day. That seems like a tractable request from my server to the ones I am following, and it does not require full fediverse search.</div><br/><div id="35722966" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35722966" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iudqnolq</span><span>|</span><a href="#35720515">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35722416">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35722819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35722966">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35722966">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That makes sense.

Thinking about this for a minute, I feel like your server could do some social graph analysis of your history of likes combined with who you follow and who they follow to suggest people to follow who meet the criteria: you do not follow them, but people whose posts you like do follow them.<p>I guess what I want to say is, I really feel like open social networks are an extremely important concept, and mastodon is the biggest one. Traction and networking effects are very important to make social networks survive. So rather than trying to build a full index on mastodon or build a new protocol that makes this easier, I really want to think about what is possible with mastodon today with simple changes. I believe that is a good path towards success.<p>Certainly twitter&#x27;s fully closed system is not what I want to rest on in perpetuity.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35722819" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35722819" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nagonago</span><span>|</span><a href="#35720515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35718550">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35722819">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35722819">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think algorithms have to be bad, there&#x27;s still room for experimentation with algorithms that don&#x27;t just &quot;maximize for engagement&quot;.

It was an exhaustive list of properties applied to each song they played, and it fed into their recommendation engine so that songs could be typed and matched with more stuff we wanna hear.<p>It failed me miserably.<p>Digital DNA, or at least its implementation on Pandora, was woefully inadequate in determining my motivation and reasons for selecting songs in a list. I created a Lenten playlist of penitential hymns, and the cardinal rule was: &quot;NO ALLELUIA&quot; which is not vocalized at all during the Lenten season. Well my recommendations were liberally sprinkled with joyous Easter shouts of the A-word, and my experience was ruined.<p>I may select songs based on particular lyric themes, seasonal considerations, bands based on their particular location or affiliation; things like that. Recommendation engines just have this kind of sledgehammer that goes &quot;Oh! You like &lt;Heavy Metal&gt;! Here&#x27;s some more &lt;Heavy Metal&gt; for ya!&quot; when my use case doesn&#x27;t even care about genre, but I was looking for lyrical themes or topics.<p>Also unlike Pandora, YouTube has one big firehose of recommendations. It is unable to segregate them within a playlist or a particular session for some purpose. The only way to isolate recommendations is by account or incognito, and that is one reason I have 3 separate personal accounts for different purposes, so that my main account&#x27;s activity does not pollute the interests and recs of the special-purpose accounts.</div><br/><div id="35723012" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35723012" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stametseater</span><span>|</span><a href="#35722702">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35722845">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35722859">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35723012">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35723012">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ah right, I see what you mean.

Like reminding you of a special birthday photo with a friend who has died and the computer has no way of knowing that.<p>The paperclip problem never goes away even if you’re in control. It’s like the butterfly effect. At least if everyone has a slightly different algorithm then the overall system wouldn’t align to produce mobs and harassment quite as easilly. Also without centralized control then mitigating those effects becomes much more complicated.<p>Even when it works flawlessly with no “side effects” it can have negative consequences. If it’s too good or you have too much fun with it then maybe you spend less time with real friends or ignoring other things. I use a chronological timeline and it gets boring sometimes. That boredom is a useful signal to me to go do something else. ( chronological is still an algorithm we just tend to not think of it as one)<p>At the end of the day I agree it’s better to have a distributed and Democratic feed then be at the mercy of someone else. That still doesn’t mean ALL of the problems with algorithmic feeds are solved by giving the user more control. It also doesn’t begin to get into the complexity of how a non-programmer would begin to tune such an algorithm without sliders and buttons that go into an algorithm someone else ultimately wrote.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35720842" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35720842" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">madeofpalk</span><span>|</span><a href="#35720707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35721818">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35721765">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35720842">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35720842">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Specifically, it&#x27;s algorithms that by design work against the user&#x27;s interest in favor of the company&#x27;s interest (ads, engagement bait, etc).<p>If the developers of a social network have incentives that are more aligned with their users then it would be possible to create genuinely useful and interesting algorithmic content feeds.</div><br/><div id="35721892" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35721892" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">2358452</span><span>|</span><a href="#35720707">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35720842">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35721765">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35721892">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35721892">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Indeed, I also think we&#x27;re, as a society, missing a fundamental freedom: algorithmic transparency.<p>That&#x27;s the ability, that should be a right, to know in particular for widely available or impactful systems, what is the algorithm behind their feed, from raw data sources (and also the parameters should be public).

Many of the instruments included in the Arturia V Collection (one of the most common collections of instrument plug ins) are made using physical modelling [1]. Modartt&#x27;s products (even more so than Arturia) offer amazing control over the physical model, with the ability to configure per-note parameters [2].<p>Speaking of virtual pipe organs, for Organteq to compete with the market leader, Hauptwerk (which is sample-based) there needs to be a good choice of expansions though. With Hauptwerk, you can download hundreds of different organs from all around the world [3]. Modartt has an expansions marketplace for Pianoteq [4], why is the same thing not available for Organteq?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arturia.com&#x2F;phi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arturia.com&#x2F;phi</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modartt.com&#x2F;pianoteq_pro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modartt.com&#x2F;pianoteq_pro</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hauptwerk.com&#x2F;instruments&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hauptwerk.com&#x2F;instruments&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modartt.com&#x2F;pianoteq_instruments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modartt.com&#x2F;pianoteq_instruments</a></div><br/><div id="38876531" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38876531" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tgv</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38876531">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38876531">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why no expansion packs? I guess because the product isn&#x27;t popular. I tried it, but Organteq just doesn&#x27;t sound good. Hauptwerk is so much better.<p>It took Modartt many years to get a decent piano model. For a long time, the more critical plugin users disliked Pianoteq. It had a sound best described as plastic (the material), synthetic. Since version 5, the sound has improved, and since Pianoteq can do things even the largest sample library can&#x27;t (we&#x27;re talking .5TB for some libraries!) at a fraction of the CPU and memory cost, it has become a lot more popular.<p>Organteq just isn&#x27;t there: it sounds synthetic, and its reverb is really lacking. It&#x27;s also not very CPU friendly. It also doesn&#x27;t really compete on price, so I expect no change unless Modartt invests heavily, but since the market is smaller than for piano sounds, don&#x27;t hold your breath.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38875326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38875326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38876531">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38875326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38875326">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The open source Aeolus physically-modelled organ is at least as good as any other pipe organ synthesis engine, unless you insist on glossy UIs (it does have a graphical UI though).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org&#x2F;linuxaudio&#x2F;aeolus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org&#x2F;linuxaudio&#x2F;aeolus&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="38876154" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38876154" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mastazi</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875326">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875720">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38876154">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38876154">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Speaking of open source pipe organs, there is also Grandorgue, however this one unlike Aeolus is sample-based <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GrandOrgue&#x2F;grandorgue">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GrandOrgue&#x2F;grandorgue</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="38875720" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38875720" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chrismorgan</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875326">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38876154">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875342">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38875720">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38875720">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Aww, seems to need a MIDI input, guess I’ll have to wait until I get home in March to try it.<p>Impressive tininess.

I know they appreciate feedback, I&#x27;ve talked to them before, so I&#x27;d suggest you tell them your concerns.<p>Good point.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m just a hobbyist but I know a few professional organists.<p>TL;DR: each organ is unique, pipe organs are not produced in series like pianos.<p>The main reason for people use something like Organteq or Hauptwerk, is usually to practice organ at home. Unlike what happens with other instruments, it is very rare for an average person to own their own pipe organ, so digital reproductions are the way to go for pretty much everyone.<p>But here&#x27;s the problem: organs are very, very different one another. With piano, you could practice e.g. on a Kawai at home then perform a recital on a Yamaha; the two pianos don&#x27;t have the same sound and the same action, but they are close enough that you can practice on one instrument then perforom on another. This is not the case with organs: a baroque organ and a romantic organ will be completely different in terms of registrations, pedalboard extension and shape, manuals etc. etc. - not only that but each pipe organ ever built, is a completely custom instrument.<p>For example, all Steinway D-274s ever built, despite some differences due to the year and place of construction, are still the same model (model D-274). But with organs, it&#x27;s almost never the case that the same organ is built twice. Each single instrument is completely unique, and that&#x27;s why we identify them by opus number, and we have catalogues of all the organs ever built, like for example this one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohta.org.au&#x2F;organs-of-australia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohta.org.au&#x2F;organs-of-australia&#x2F;</a><p>So, the main problem for someone setting up a practice organ is to have access to a digital model that is either that exact organ, or at least a very similar instrument to the one they will use to perform in public. For hobbyists like me who don&#x27;t plan to perform, there is still a need to at least have a certain type of organ available, because of the great diversity of organs.</div><br/><div id="38877092" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38877092" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">weinzierl</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38874147">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38877092">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38877092">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>&quot;organs are very, very different one another.&quot;</i><p>Anna Lapwood addressed this in a recent TikTok.

In order to properly model an organ in a particular setting you&#x27;d need to model the building as well and that is getting into a wholly different level of complexity.<p>Pianos are more or less designed to sound &#x27;the same&#x27; (with some obvious differences between major brands and some pianos that have been constructed very explicitly to sound different, such as the Klavins instruments).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klavins-pianos.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;klavins-pianos.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;</a><p>So within reason you can model a particular piano just by specifying make and model and look up a bunch of parameters in a table.<p>With an organ in a &#x27;virtual&#x27; church you could specify the exact disposition (the number and kind of sets of various pipes and other complications) of the organ, and you could supply some basic parameters of the space (size, area, placements of the ranks and so on). But I suspect that if you did that you&#x27;d not get even close to what the real instrument in its actual setting sounds like. Organs are <i>super</i> temperamental, air pressure, humidity, temperature, intonation, various stuff that is broken (almost no mechanical organ is ever in perfect shape), mechanism sounds (which can appear very different even within the same make and model) and so on.<p>This is a stupendously hard problem and as a happy user of Pianoteq I&#x27;m impressed with Modartt even attempting this and I really hope they will succeed in being able to switch seamlessly between different venues and to place an organ of a different manufacturer into an existing church (just to give one example of what that would make possible). But I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath for it and sample based organs (including the free GrandOrgue) still hold a significant edge compared to Modartt&#x27;s organ simulator. But for piano it is now so good I <i>almost</i> prefer it to the real thing for practice. Not that I&#x27;m such a discerning user, more that I&#x27;ve grown up with pianos and they&#x27;re always (unless very recently tuned) a bit out of tune and that can be quite annoying. The software based one is always perfectly tuned and sounds as good or even better than the best sampled instruments (personal favorite from the sample side of the aisle: Yamaha P-515 Bosendorfer sample set is extremely good).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38873921" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38873921" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">HPsquared</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38873857">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38874147">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38873722">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38873921">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38873921">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Tuning the model parameters to sound like a sampled piano sounds like an interesting optimization problem.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38873722" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38873722" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TexanFeller</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873565">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38875841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38873722">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38873722">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’m strangely interested in pipe organs, largely because to my ear Toccatta and Fugue in D Minor(BWV 565) is one of the most thrilling pieces of music, like something sent from heaven.

There is absolutely no comparison: not a percussive piano banging on metal strings, not a plectrum on a lute such as guitar, no synthesizer can come anywhere close. Electronic organs can approximate the sound, but not the feel, grandeur, and mighty power of a full-throated organ.<p>The reason that liturgical Christians have used pipe organs is because of the close approximation of the human voice from the very pipes. A pipe organ works (needless to say) by passing air through columns and making it vibrate at specific frequencies. This is very close to the mechanism used in the human voice. Therefore, it is effortless, even for an inexperienced singer, to summon up a passable tune when led by a competent organist. There are myriad cues which can be employed to wordlessly signal when singing will start and stop, and whether the upcoming strophe is proper to a soloist, the choir, or the whole assembly to come in at once.<p>In my days at a chorister, we did indeed rely on grand piano, acoustic guitars, eletronic 1980s-tech organ, and even drums&#x2F;bass&#x2F;violin, so unfortunately I did not enjoy much choral experience next to an authentic pipe organ. But now I worship from the pews with one of the best instruments in hundreds of miles, an experienced dedicated schola, and a skilled professional organist&#x2F;director. Needless to say, it was a breathtaking and gorgeous Christmas as we added a brass ensemble and sang our hearts out.<p>Pipe organs never fail to disappoint the tech nerd in us. My own cathedral has a special camera which they use every week, during live streams, to display the manual as the organist plays it, and believe me, pipe organs are cutting-edge tech nowadays, using computer monitors, interfaces, MIDI and all the trappings, to produce good old-fashioned sound from real pipes. I feel it is truly a unique traditional instrument that can be the best of both worlds, and indeed our own church affirms its &quot;pride of place&quot; in liturgical worship at all times.</div><br/><div id="38875378" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38875378" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38874437">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38875378">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38875378">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; There is absolutely no comparison: not a percussive piano banging on metal strings, not a plectrum on a lute such as guitar, no synthesizer can come anywhere close.

By this I mean each pipe can only produce the sound of the note turning on, the sound of the note sustaining, and the sound of the note decaying, and these are substantially the same every time. (There are subtle differences, because the air flow depends on the state of other pipes playing at the same time, but this is not something musicians actively control, and is traditionally considered a defect to be minimized in high quality organs). It&#x27;s possible to modify the sound with a tremulant or a swell box, but these are crude compared to what a skilled singer can do.<p>Compare the expression you can get out of a saxophone by varying embouchure and breathing. A saxophone can produce a range of timbres, and the player can dynamically vary the timbre over time. It&#x27;s mechanically similar to a reed pipe, but the player has far more control over it. And a flute is similar to a flue pipe, again with the player having more control over the sound.<p>But a real pipe organ has some measurable advantages. First, the great multitude of independent sound sources. A real pipe organ has a spatial quality that&#x27;s impossible to reproduce with stereo speakers. People say that the building is a part of the pipe organ, and that&#x27;s IMO justified because all these sound sources interact with it produce an incredibly complex reverberation field. The sound you hear when you move your head sounds &quot;big&quot; in a way that would require a very complex speaker setup to reproduce. (Maybe high-order Ambisonics could do it.)<p>Second, the non-existent distortion. Big pipe organs have pedal sections that produce very deep and loud bass. On a real pipe organ, this is a pure harmonic sound (like all wind instruments, bowed strings, and voice). But deep and loud bass is difficult to reproduce with speakers, so there will be substantial non-linearity. If you&#x27;re reproducing only a single harmonic note, this will only result in harmonic distortion. Harmonic distortion is no big deal, because it&#x27;s effectively the same thing as changing the voicing of the pipe. You can filter the recorded&#x2F;synthesized sound to compensate. But if you&#x27;re trying to play multiple notes at once with the same speaker, you&#x27;ll get intermodulation distortion, which adds a &quot;muddy&quot; inharmonic sound you never get from real pipes. The only solution here is adding more speakers, especially for bass notes, but again you&#x27;re increasing cost and complexity.<p>I don&#x27;t know how complex a sound system would need to be to reproduce a pipe organ such that a skilled listener couldn&#x27;t distinguish it in an ABX test from the real thing. It would be very difficult to test, because the two would interact with each other acoustically if they were in the same building, and an ABX test requires rapid switching. But in any case, I think most people simulating pipe organs aren&#x27;t even trying to pass this theoretical test.<p>All this means there is still a place for traditional pipe organs, and if you&#x27;ve never heard one in person I recommend trying it.</div><br/><div id="38875412" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38875412" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">PaulDavisThe1st</span><span>|</span><a href="#38873888">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38874253">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38873674">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38875412">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38875412">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most of the attempts to do digital pipe organs that are roughly equal to their purely analog cousins end up using substantial chunks of the physical infrastructure of the analog versions - the building, and sometimes even the pipes themselves, generally per-pipe transducers (&quot;speakers&quot;).<p>You can reproduce the 3D soundfield of a big organ using wavefield synthesis. I heard a phenomenal recording&#x2F;reproduction of a performance of a Messaien piece recorded in the Koeln cathedral and played back at the TU Berlin with their 4k+ speaker wavefield synthesis system.

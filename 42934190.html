I averaged around 200 lines of code an hour, including the business logic and unit tests. Total was around 2200 lines. So, not a big project, but not a throw away script. The code was perfectly fine for what we needed. This is the third time I&#x27;ve done this, and each time I get faster and better at it.<p>1. I find a &quot;pair programming&quot; mentality is key. I focus on the high-level code, and let the model focus on the lower level code. I code review all the code, and provide feedback. Blindly accepting the code is a terrible approach.<p>2. Generating unit tests is critical. After I like the gist of some code, I ask for some smoke tests. Again, peer review the code and adjust as needed.<p>3. Be liberal with starting a new chat: the models can get easily confused with longer context windows. If you start to see things go sideways, start over.<p>4. Give it code examples. Don&#x27;t prompt with English only.<p>FWIW, o3-mini was the best model I&#x27;ve seen so far; Sonnet 3.5 New is a close second.</div><br/><div id="42936709" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42936709" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42937346">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42936709">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42936709">[21 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess the things I don&#x27;t like about Chat are the same things I don&#x27;t like about pair (or team) programming. I&#x27;ve always thought of programming as a solitary activity. You visualize the data structures, algorithms, data paths, calling flow and stack, and so on, in your mind, with very high throughput &quot;discussions&quot; happening entirely in your brain. Your brain is high bandwidth, low latency. Effortlessly and instantly move things around and visualize them. Figure everything out. Finally, when it&#x27;s correct, you send it to the slow output device (your fingers).<p>The minute you have to discuss those things with someone else, your bandwidth decreases by orders of magnitude and now you have to put words to these things and describe them, and physically type them in or vocalize them. Then your counterpart has to input them through his eyes and ears, process that, and re-output his thoughts to you. Slow, slow, slow, and prone to error and  specificity problems as you translate technical concepts to English and back.<p>Chat as a UX interface is similarly slow and poorly specific. It has all the shortcomings of discussing your idea with a human and really no upside besides the dictionary-like recall.</div><br/><div id="42938119" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42938119" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yarekt</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936709">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42937127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42938119">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42938119">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s such a mechanical way of describing pair programming.

Over time the two of you figure out how to use each other&#x27;s strengths, and as both of you immerse yourself in the same context you begin to understand what&#x27;s needed without speaking every bit of syntax between each other.<p>In best cases as a driver you end up producing high quality on the first pass, because you know that your partner will immediately catch anything that doesn&#x27;t look right. You also go fast because you can sometimes skim over complexities letting your partner think ahead and share that context load.<p>I&#x27;ll leave readers to find all the caveats here<p>Edit: I should probably mention why I think Chat Interface for AI is not working like Pair programming: As much as it may fake it, AI isn&#x27;t learning anything while you&#x27;re chatting to it. Its pointless to argue your case or discuss architectural approaches. An approach that yields better results with Chat AI is to just edit&#x2F;expand your original prompt. It also feels less like a waste of time.<p>With Pair programming, you may chat upfront, but you won&#x27;t reach that shared understanding until you start trying to implement something. For now Chat AI has no shared understanding, just &quot;what I asked you to do&quot; thing, and that&#x27;s not good enough.</div><br/><div id="42938201" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42938201" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">RHSeeger</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42938119">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42944074">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42938201">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42938201">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think it depends heavily on the people.

For me pair programming accelerates development to much more than 2x.<p>The value of pair programming is inversely proportional to the expertise of the participant.

By forcing you to use the slower I&#x2F;O parts of your brain (and that of your partner) the process becomes more deliberate, allowing you to catch edge cases, bad design patterns, and would-be bugs before even putting pen to paper so to speak. Not to mention that it immediately reduces the bus factor by having two people with a good understanding of the code.<p>I’m not saying pair programming is a silver bullet, and I tend to agree that working on your own can be vastly more efficient.

My experience is close to that of &#x27;ryandrake.<p>I&#x27;ve been coding long enough to notice there are times where the problem is complex and unclear enough that my own thought process will turn into pair programming with myself, literally chatting with myself in a text file; this process has the bandwidth and latency on the same order as talking to another person, so I might just as well do that and get the benefit of an independent perspective.<p>The above is really more of a design-level discussion. However, there are other times - precisely those times that pair programming is meant for - when the problem is clear enough I can immerse myself in it. Using the slow I&#x2F;O mode, being deliberate is exactly the <i>opposite</i> of what I need then. By moving alone and focused, keeping my thoughts <i>below the level of words</i>, I can explore the problem space much further, rapidly proposing a solution, feeling it out, proposing another, comparing, deciding on a direction, noticing edge cases and bad design up front and dealing with them, all in a rapid feedback loop with test. Pair programming in this scenario would truly force me to &quot;use the slower I&#x2F;O parts of your brain&quot;, in that exact sense: it&#x27;s like splitting a highly-optimized in-memory data processing pipeline in two, and making the halves communicate over IPC. <i>With JSON</i>.<p>As for bus factor, I find the argument bogus anyway. For that to work, pair programming would&#x27;ve to be executed with the same partner or small group of partners, preferably working on the same or related code modules, daily, over the course of weeks at least - otherwise neither them nor I are going to have enough exposure to understand what the other is working on. But it&#x27;s not how pair programming worked when I&#x27;ve experienced it.<p>It&#x27;s a problem with code reviews, too: if your project has depth[0], I won&#x27;t really understand the whole context of what you&#x27;re doing, and you won&#x27;t understand the context of my work, so our reviews of each others&#x27; code will quickly degenerate to spotting typos, style violations, and peculiar design choices; neither of us will have time or mental capacity to <i>fully</i> understand the changeset before &quot;+2 LGTM&quot;-ing it away.<p>--<p>[0] - I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a a better, established term for it. What I mean is depth vs. breadth in the project architecture. Example of depth: you have a main execution orchestrator, you have an external data system that handles integrations with a dozen different data storage systems, then you have math-heavy business logic on data, then you have RPC for integrating with GUI software developed by another team, then you have extensive configuration system, etc. - each of those areas is full of design and coding challenges that don&#x27;t transfer to any other. Contrast that with an example of breadth: a typical webapp or mobile app, where 80% of the code is just some UI components and a hundred different screens, with very little unique or domain-specific logic. In those projects, developers are like free electrons in metal: they can pick any part of the project at any given moment and be equally productive working on it, because every part is basically the same as every other part. In those projects, I can see both pair programming and code reviews deliver on their promises in full.</div><br/><div id="42943013" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42943013" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bcoates</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42938721">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42941712">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42943013">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42943013">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Agreed, particularly on code reviews: the only useful code reviews I&#x27;ve had were either in an outright trainee&#x2F;expert relationship or when the reviewer is very experienced in the gotchas of the project being modified and the reviewer is new.<p>Peer and near-peer reviews have always wound up being nitpicking or perfunctory.<p>An alternative that might work if you want two hands on every change for process reasons is to have the reviewer do something closer to formal QA, building and running the changed code to verify it has the expected behavior.

Sure, it can do hands but they still don&#x27;t get 3D space nor temporal movements. It&#x27;s great for scrolling through Twitter but the longer you look the more surreal they get. This even includes the new ByteDance model also on the front page. But with coding models they ignore context of the codebase and the results feel more like patchwork. They feel like what you&#x27;d be annoyed at with a junior dev for writing because not only do you have to go through 10 PRs to make it pass the test cases but the lack of context just builds a lot of tech debt. How they&#x27;ll build unit tests that technically work but don&#x27;t capture the actual issues and usually can be highly condensed while having greater coverage. It feels very gluey, like copy pasting from stack overflow when hyper focused on the immediate outcome instead of understanding the goal. It is too &quot;solution&quot; oriented, not understanding the underlying heuristics and is more frustrating than dealing with the human equivalent who says something &quot;works&quot; as evidenced by the output.

There&#x27;s a grave misunderstanding in this adage[0], and I think many interpret it as &quot;don&#x27;t worry about efficiency, worry about output.&quot; But the context is that you shouldn&#x27;t optimize without first profiling the code, not that you shouldn&#x27;t optimize![1] I find it also funny revisiting this quote, because it seems like it is written by a stranger in a strange land, where programmers are overly concerned with optimizing their code.

</code></pre>
Which it seems you do too. But for clarity, there&#x27;s a big difference between building the &#x2F;wrong&#x2F; thing and &#x2F;not the right thing&#x2F;. The underlying point of my comment is that not only is communication difficult, but the overall goals are ambiguous. That a lot of time should be dedicated to getting this right. Yes, that involves finding out what things are wrong and that is the sentiment behind the original meaning of &quot;fail fast&quot; but I think that term has come to mean something a bit different now. Moreover, I believe that there&#x27;s just people not looking at details.<p>It is really hard to figure out what the right thing is. We humans don&#x27;t do this just through chat. We experiment, discuss, argue, draw, and there&#x27;s tons of inference and reliance upon shared understandings. There&#x27;s a lot of associated context. You&#x27;re right that a dysfunctional organization (not uncommon) is worse, but these things are still quite common in highly functioning organizations. Your explicit statement about management having even less of an idea of what the right solution is, is explicitly what we&#x27;re pushing back against. Saying that that is a large part of a developer&#x27;s job. I would argue that the main reason we have a better idea is due to our technical skills, our depth of knowledge, our experience. A compression machine (LLM) will get some of this, but there&#x27;s a big gap when trying to get to the end point. Pareto is a bitch. We all know there is a huge difference between a demonstrating prototype and an actual product. That the amount of effort and resources are exponentially different. ML systems specifically struggle with detail and nuance, but this is the root of those resource differences.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example for clarity. Considering the iPad, the existence of third party note taking apps can be interpreted of nothing short of Apple&#x27;s failure. I mean for the love of god, you got the pencil and you can&#x27;t pull up notes and interact with it like it is a piece of paper? It&#x27;s how the damned thing is advertised! A third party note taking app should be interpreted by Apple as showing their weak points. But you can&#x27;t even zoom on the notes app?! Sure, you can turn on the accessibility setting and zoom with triple tap (significantly diverging from the standard pinching gesture used literally everywhere else) but if you do this (assuming full screen) you are just zooming in on the portion of the actual screen and not zooming in the notes. So you get stupid results like not having access to your pen&#x27;s settings. Which is extra important here given that the likely reason someone would zoom is to adjust details and certainly you&#x27;re going to want to adjust the eraser size. What I&#x27;m trying to say is that there&#x27;s a lot of low hanging fruit here that should be incredibly obvious were you to actually use the application, dog-fooding. Instead, Apple is dedicating time into hand writing recognition and equation solving, which in practice (at least in my experience) end up creating a more jarring experience and cause more editing. Though it is cool when it does work. I&#x27;d say that here, Apple is not building the right thing. They are completely out of touch with the actual goals and experiences of the users. It&#x27;s not that they didn&#x27;t build a perfect app, it is that they fail to build basic functionality.<p>But of course, Apple probably doesn&#x27;t care. Because they significantly prioritize profits over building a quality product. These are orthogonal aspects and they can be simultaneously optimized. One should not need pick one over another and the truth is that our economics should ensure alignment, that quality begets profits and that one can&#x27;t &quot;hack&quot; the metrics.<p>Apple is far from alone here though. I&#x27;d say this &quot;low hanging infuriating bullshit&quot; is actually quite common. In fact, I think it is becoming more common. I have argued here before about the need for more &quot;grumpy developers.&quot; I think if you&#x27;re not grumpy, you should be concerned. Our job is to find problems, break them down into a way that can be addressed, and to resolve them. The &quot;grumpiness&quot; here is a dissatisfaction with the state of things. Given that nothing is perfect, there should always be reason to be &quot;grumpy.&quot; A good developer should be able to identify and fix problems without being asked. But I do think there&#x27;s a worrying decline of (lack of!) &quot;grumpy&quot; types, and I have no doubt this is connected to the rapid rise of vaporware and shitty products.<p>Also, I notice you play Devil&#x27;s advocate a lot. While I think it can be useful, I think it can be overused. It needs to drive home the key limitations to an argument, especially when they are uncomfortable. Though I think in our case, I&#x27;m the one making the argument that diverges from the norm.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="42937928" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42937928" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lucasmullens</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42937346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42938298">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42938207">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42937928">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42937928">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; But with coding models they ignore context of the codebase and the results feel more like patchwork.<p>Have you tried Cursor?

The LLM might get you a &quot;result&quot; faster, but you are much more likely to miss the learning process that comes with struggling. Because that makes you much faster (and more flexible) not just next time but in many situations where even a subset is similar. Which yeah, totally fine to glue shit together when you don&#x27;t care and just need something, but there&#x27;s a lot of missed value if you need to revisit any of that. I do have concerns that people will be plateaued at junior levels. I hope it doesn&#x27;t cause seniors to revert to juniors, which I&#x27;ve seen happen without LLMs. If you stop working on these types of problems, you lose the skills. There&#x27;s already an issue where we rush to get output and it has clear effects on the stagnation of devs. We have far more programmers than ever but I&#x27;m not confident we have a significant number more wizards (the percentage of wizards is decreasing). There&#x27;s fewer people writing programs just for fun. But &quot;for fun&quot; is one of our greatest learning tools as humans.

Of course, in React—especially at first—I had to explain how to do things, but only once to create a component. After that, I could just tell the system what to do.

I find a &quot;pair programming&quot; mentality is key. I focus on the high-level code, and let the model focus on the lower level code. I code review all the code, and provide feedback. Blindly accepting the code is a terrible approach.<p>This is what I&#x27;ve found to be key. If I start a new feature, I will work with the LLM to do the following:<p>- Create problem and solution statement<p>- Create requirements and user stories<p>- Create architecture<p>- Create skeleton code. This is critical since it lets me understand what it wants to do.<p>- Generate a summary of the skeleton code<p>Once I have done the above, I will have the LLM generate a reusable prompt that I can use to start LLM conversations with.  Below is an example of how I turn everything into a reusable prompt.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.gitsense.com&#x2F;?chat=b96ce9e0-da19-45e8-bfec-a3ecf408ee71" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.gitsense.com&#x2F;?chat=b96ce9e0-da19-45e8-bfec-a3ec...</a><p>As I make changes like add new files, I will need to generate a new prompt but it is worth the effort.  And you can see it in action here.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.gitsense.com&#x2F;?chat=b8c4b221-55e5-4ed6-860e-12f056b682ad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.gitsense.com&#x2F;?chat=b8c4b221-55e5-4ed6-860e-12f0...</a><p>The first message is the reusable prompt message. With the first message in place, I can describe the problem or requirements and ask the LLM what files it will need to better understand how to implement things.<p>What I am currently doing highlights how I think LLM is a game changer.  VCs are going for moonshots instead of home runs. The ability to gather requirements and talk through a solution before even coding is how I think LLMs will revolutionize things.  It is great that it can produce usable code, but what I&#x27;ve found it to be invaluable is it helps you organize your thoughts.<p>In the last link, I am having a conversation with both DeepSeek v3 and Sonnet 3.5 and the LLMs legitimately saved me hours in work, without even writing a single line of code.  In the past, I would have just implemented the feature and been done with it, and then I would have to fix something if I didn&#x27;t think of an edge case. With LLMs, it literally takes minutes to develop a plan that is extremely well documented that can be shared with others.<p>This ability to generate design documents is how I think LLMs will ultimately be used.  The bonus is producing code, but the reality is that documentation (which can be tedious and frustrating) is a requirement for software development. In my opinion, this is where LLMs will forever change things.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42941403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42941403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zahlman</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42937109">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936768">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42941403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42941403">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">LoC per hour seems to me like a terrible metric.</div><br/><div id="42942607" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42942607" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esafak</span><span>|</span><a href="#42936346">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42941403">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936768">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42942607">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42942607">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why?

LLMs <i>already solved</i> &quot;intuitive understanding&quot;, and the realtime multimodal variants (e.g. the thing behind &quot;Advanced Voice&quot; in ChatGPT app) handle tone of voice in both directions. As for nonverbal cues, I don&#x27;t know yet - I got live video enabled in ChatGPT only few days ago and didn&#x27;t have time to test it, but I would be surprised if it couldn&#x27;t read the basics of body language at this point.<p>Talking to a computer still sucks as an user interface - not because a computer can&#x27;t communicate on multiple channels the way people do, as it can do it now too. It sucks for the same reason <i>talking to people sucks as an user interface</i> - because the kind of tasks we use computers for (and that aren&#x27;t just talking with&#x2F;to&#x2F;at other people via electronic means) are better handle by <i>doing</i> than by <i>talking about them</i>. We need an interface to operate a tool, not an interface to an agent that operates a tool for us.<p>As an example, consider driving (as in, realtime control - not just &quot;getting from point A to B&quot;): a chat interface to driving would suck just as badly as being a backseat driver sucks for both people in the car. In contrast, a steering wheel, instead of being a bandwidth-limiting indirection, is an <i>anti-indirection</i> - not only it lets you control the machine with your body, the control is direct enough that over time your brain learns to abstract it away, and the car becomes an extension of your body. We need more of tangible interfaces like that with computers.<p>The steering wheel case, of course, would fail with &quot;AI-level smarts&quot; - but that still doesn&#x27;t mean we should embrace <i>talking</i> to computers. A good analogy is <i>dance</i> - it&#x27;s an interaction between two independently smart agents exploring an activity together, and as they do it enough, it becomes fluid.<p>So dance, IMO, is the steering wheel analogy for AI-powered interfaces, and that is the space we need to explore more.</div><br/><div id="42936587" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42936587" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ryandrake</span><span>|</span><a href="#42934898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936328">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42936587">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42936587">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; We need an interface to operate a tool, not an interface to an agent that operates a tool for us.<p>Excellent comment and it gets to the heart of something I&#x27;ve had trouble clearly articulating: We&#x27;ve slowly lost the concept that a computer is a tool that the user wields and commands to do things.

A chat interface for getting a ride from a car is almost certainly doable?  So long as the itinerary and other details remain separate things?  At large, you are basically using a chat bot to be a travel agent, no?<p>But, as you say, a chat interface would be a terrible way to actively drive a car.  And that is a different thing, but I&#x27;m growing convinced many will focus on the first idea while staving off the complaints of the latter.<p>In another thread, I assert that chat is probably a fine way to order up something that fits a repertoire that trained a bot.  But, I don&#x27;t think sticking to the chat window is the best way to interface with what it delivers.

In most of the cases I can imagine chat interface to be fine (or even ideal), it&#x27;s really only good as a starting point. Take two examples based on your reply:<p>1) Getting a car ride. &quot;Computer, order me a cab home&quot; is a good start. It&#x27;s even OK if I then get asked to narrow it down between several different services&#x2F;fares (next time I&#x27;ll remember to specify that up front). But if I want to inspect the route (or perhaps adjust it, in a hypothetical service that supports it), I&#x27;d already prefer an interactive map I can scroll and zoom, with PoIs I can tap on to get their details, than to continue a verbal chat.<p>2) Ordering food in a fast food restaurant. I&#x27;m fine starting it with a conversation if I know what I want. However, getting back the order summary in prose (or worse, read out loud) would already be taxing, and if I wanted to make final adjustments, I&#x27;d beg for buttons and numeric input boxes. And, in case I <i>don&#x27;t</i> know what I want, or what is available (and at what prices), a chat interface is a non-starter. Interactive menu is a must.<p>You sum this up perfectly:<p>&gt; <i>You almost certainly want to be much more actively &quot;hands on&quot; in very domain specific ways with the artifacts produced.</i><p>Chat may be great to get that first artifact, but afterwards, there&#x27;s almost always a more hands-on interface that would be <i>much</i> better.</div><br/><div id="42940757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42940757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taeric</span><span>|</span><a href="#42934898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42940389">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935682">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42940757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42940757">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh, apologies, I meant my post to be a highlight of how I agree with you!

In an email you will frequently have to provide more context for your answers to make sense. Chat is a conversation, which search drops you straight into, may with AI you could get placed at an appropriate starting point, but you&#x27;re still reading a conversation. It&#x27;s much easier to get dropped into a correspondence.

You can forward them to any other recipient, you can add and remove any recipient to and from the conversation at any time. It is conceptually powerful and flexible in a similar way that files in a file system are a powerful and flexible way to organize data. And it is easy to understand.<p>While all of these features could in principle be realized in a chat system as well, in practice they don’t provide that flexibility and power.<p>Another usability feature of emails is that they have a subject line. This allows to meaningfully list emails in a compact fashion. In a desktop interface, you can easily view and visually grep 50 emails or more at once in a mail folder or list of search results (in something like Outlook or Thunderbird or Mutt). This allows working with emails more efficiently than with a chat view where you can only see a few messages at once, and only of the same thread or channel.<p>Yet another usability feature of emails is that each email has its own read&#x2F;unread status. This, again, is facilitated by each email being its own separate data object, and by the separation between subject and body, which allows the read status to be unambiguously bound to “opening” the email, or to navigating in the list of emails alongside a preview pane. And you can mark any email as unread again. In chats, the granularity of read&#x2F;unread is the whole chat, whether you’ve actually read all of it or not. You can’t easily track what you’ve read or not in an automated way as with email, other than by that coarse-grained linear time-based property of when you last visited the channel.</div><br/><div id="42937050" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42937050" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jerjerjer</span><span>|</span><a href="#42934898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935707">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935601">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42937050">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42937050">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Accessing Thunderbird via JDBC from my favorite SQL client was so convenient.

I&#x27;m not worried about someone fishing for something I said that could be construed as commitment or admission - they can just as easily do that with e-mail[0]. For me, conversations can be <i>extremely valuable</i>, and I gravitate towards people and places where that&#x27;s a common case. HN is one of such places - the comment threads here are conversations (half-way in form between chat and e-mail), and they often are valuable, as people often share deep insights, interesting ideas, worthwhile advice and useful facts. Because they&#x27;re valuable, my instinct is that <i>they need to be preserved</i>, so that myself and others can find those gems again, or (re)discover them when searching for solutions, or read again to reevaluate, etc.<p>So now imagine such (idealized) HN threads transplanted to Discord or Slack. Same people, same topics, same insights, just unrolling in the form of a regular chat. All that value, briefly there to partake in, and then forever lost after however much time it takes for it to get pushed up a few screens worth of lines in the chat log. People don&#x27;t habitually scroll back very far on a regular basis (and the UI of most chat platforms starts to rapidly break down if you try), and the lack of defined structure (bounded conversations labeled by a topic) plus weak search tools means you&#x27;re unlikely to find a conversation again even if you know where and when it took place.<p>That, plus ephemeral nature of casual chat means not just the platform, but also some of the users expect it to quickly disappear, leading to what I consider anti-features such as the ability to unilaterally edit or <i>unsend</i> any message at arbitrary time in the future. It takes just one participant deciding, for whatever reason, to mass-delete their past messages, for many conversations to lose most of their value forever.<p>--<p>[0] - Especially that the traditional communication style, both private and business, is overly verbose.

A chat UI is a great interface for iterating on an image and dialing it in over a series of iterations. The key here is that the AI model needs to keep context both of the image generation history and that chat history.<p>I think this applies to any “fuzzy generation” scenario. It certainly shouldn’t be the only tool, and (at least as it stands today) isn’t good enough to finalize and fine tune the final result, but a series of “a foo with a bar” “slightly less orange” “make the bar a bit more like a fizzbuzz” interactions with a good chat UI can really get a good 80% solution.<p>But like all new toys, AI and AI chat will be hammered into a few thousand places where it makes no sense until the hype dies down and we come up with rules and guidelines for where it does and doesn’t work</div><br/><div id="42936757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42936757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">badsectoracula</span><span>|</span><a href="#42934898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936062">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42934997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42936757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42936757">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Specifically I’m thinking of AI image generation<p>I heavily disagree here, chat - or really <i>text</i> - is a horrible UI for image generation, unless you have almost zero idea of what you want to achieve <i>and</i> you don&#x27;t really care about the final results.<p>Typing &quot;make the bar a bit more like a fizzbuzz&quot; in some textbox  is awful UX compared to, say, clicking on the &quot;bar&quot; and selecting &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; or drag-and-dropping &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; on the &quot;bar&quot; or really anything that takes advantage of the fact we&#x27;re interacting with a graphical environment to do work on graphics.<p>In fact it is a horrible UI for anything, except perhaps chatbots and tasks that have to do with text like grammar correction, altering writing styles, etc.<p>It is helpful for impressing people (especially people with money) though.</div><br/><div id="42940422" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42940422" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tpmoney</span><span>|</span><a href="#42934898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42936757">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42934997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42940422">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42940422">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Typing &quot;make the bar a bit more like a fizzbuzz&quot; in some textbox is awful UX compared to, say, clicking on the &quot;bar&quot; and selecting &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; or drag-and-dropping &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; on the &quot;bar&quot; or really anything that takes advantage of the fact we&#x27;re interacting with a graphical environment to do work on graphics.<p>That assumes that you have a UX capable of determining what you&#x27;re clicking on in the generated image (which we could call a given if we assume a sufficiently capable AI model since we&#x27;re already instructing it to alter the thing), and also that it can determine from your click that you&#x27;ve intended to click on the &quot;foo&quot; not the &quot;greeble&quot; that is on the foo or the shadow covering that part of the foo or anything else that might be in the same Z stack as your intended target. Pixel bitching adventure games come to mind as an example of how badly this can go for us. And yes, this is solvable, Squeak has a UI where repeatedly clicking in the same spot will iterate through the list of possibilities in that Z stack. But it could also get really messy really quickly.<p>Then we have to assume that your UX will be able to generate an entire list of possible things you might want to be able to to do with that thing that you&#x27;ve clicked, including adding to it, removing it, removing part of it, moving it, transforming its dimensions, altering its colors, altering the material surface and on and on and on. And that list of possibilities needs to be navigable and searchable in a way that&#x27;s faster than just typing &quot;make the bar more like a fizzbuzz&quot; into a context aware chat box.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not arguing the chat interface should be the only interface. In fact, as you point out we&#x27;re using a graphical system, it would be great if you could click on things or select them and have the system work on too. It should be able to take additional input than just chat.

For side projects, I have found it extremely useful to provide the entire codebase as context and send concise prompts focusing on a single requirement. Claude handles &quot;junior developer&quot; tasks well when each unit of work is clearly separated.<p>Zed makes it trivial to attach documentation and terminal output as context. To reduce risk of hallucination, I now prefer working in static, strongly-typed languages and use libraries with detailed documentation, so that I can send documentation of the library alongside the codebase and prompt. This sounds like a lot of work, but all I do is type &quot;&#x2F;f&quot; or &quot;&#x2F;t&quot; in Zed. When I know a task only modifies a single file, then I use the &quot;inline assist&quot; feature and review the diffs generated by the LLM.<p>Additionally, I have found it extremely useful to actually comment a codebase. LLMs are good at unstructured human language, it&#x27;s what they were originally designed for. You can use them to maintain comments across a codebase, which in turn helps LLMs since they get to see code <i>and</i> design together.<p>Last weekend, I was able to re-build a mobile app I made a year ago <i>from scratch</i> with a cleaner code base, better UI, <i>and</i> implement new features on top (making the rewrite worth my time). The app in question took me about a week to write by hand last year; the rewrite took exactly 2 days.<p>---<p>As a side note: a huge advantage of Zed with locally-hosted models is that one can correct the code emitted by the model and force the model to re-generate its prior response with those corrections. This is probably the &quot;killer feature&quot; of models like qwen2.5-coder:32b. Rather than sending extra prompts and bloating the context, one can just delete all output from where the first mistake was made, correct the mistake, then resume generation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42935845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42935845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">stitched2gethr</span><span>|</span><a href="#42935503">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42939579">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935766">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42935845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42935845">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this misses the point.

- Declarative: Signup the user using their email address
- Imperative: To do the same, we will need to implement the smtp library, which means discovering that we need an SMTP server, so now we need to choose which one. And when purchasing an SMTP Server plan, we discover that there are rate limit, so now we need to add some bot protection to our signup page (IP Rate Limit only? ReCaptcha?

Cursor’s “agent” composer mode is so much better than what Continue offered. The agent can automatically grep the codebase for relevant files and then read them. It can create entirely new files from scratch. I can still manually provide some files as context, but it’s not usually <i>necessary</i>. With Continue, everything was very manual.<p>Cursor also does a great job of showing inline diffs of what composer is doing, so you can quickly review every change.<p>I don’t think there’s any reason Continue can’t match these features, but it hadn’t, last I checked.<p>Cursor also focuses on sane defaults, which is nice. The tab completion model is very good, and the composer model defaults to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is arguably the best non-reasoning code model. (One would hope that Cursor gets agent-composer working with reasoning models soon.) Continue felt much more technical… which is nice for power users, but not always the best starting place.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42935869" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42935869" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freeone3000</span><span>|</span><a href="#42935503">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42939810">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42938713">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42935869">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42935869">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s not nearly as slick. cursor’s indexing and integration are significant value-adds.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="42938713" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42938713" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mkozlows</span><span>|</span><a href="#42935503">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935766">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42938713">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42938713">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Windsurf is even moreso this way -- it&#x27;ll look through your codebase trying to find the right files to inspect, it runs the build&#x2F;test stuff and examines the output to see what went wrong.<p>I found interacting with it via chat to be super-useful and a great way to get stuff done.

I think he&#x27;s saying that to fully specify what a given computer program should do, you have to provide all kinds of details, and human language is too compressed and too sloppy to always include those details. For example, you might say &quot;make a logon screen&quot; but there are an infinite number of ways this could be done and until you answer a lot of questions you may not get what you want.<p>If you asked me two or three years ago I would have strongly agreed with this theory. I used to point out that every line of code was a decision made by a programmer and that programming languages were just better ways to convey all those decisions than human language because they eliminated ambiguity and were much terser.<p>I changed my mind when I saw how LLMs work. They tend to fill in the ambiguity with good defaults that are somewhere between &quot;how everybody does it&quot; and &quot;how a reasonably bright junior programmer would do it&quot;.<p>So you say &quot;give me a log on screen&quot; and you get something pretty normal with Username and Password and a decent UI and some decent color choices and it works fine.<p>If you wanted to provide more details, you could tell it to use the background color #f9f9f9, but a part of what surprised my and caused me to change my mind on this matter was that you could also leave that out and you wouldn&#x27;t get an error; you wouldn&#x27;t get white text on white background; you would get a decent color that might be #f9f9f9 or might be #a1a1a1 but you saved a lot of time by not thinking about that level of detail and you got a good result.</div><br/><div id="42935868" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42935868" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zamfi</span><span>|</span><a href="#42935727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42938358">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42935868">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42935868">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, and in fact this is about the best-case scenario in many ways: &quot;good defaults&quot; that get you approximately where you want to be, with a way to update when those defaults aren&#x27;t what you want.<p>Right now we have a ton of AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;LLM folks working on this first clear challenge: better models that generate better defaults, which is great—but also will never solve the problem 100%, which is the second, less-clear challenge: there will always be times you don&#x27;t want the defaults, especially as your requests become more and more high-level. It&#x27;s the MS Word challenge reconstituted in the age of LLMs: everyone wants 20% of what&#x27;s in Word, but it&#x27;s not the same 20%. The good defaults are good except for that 20% you want to be non-default.<p>So there need to be ways to say &quot;I want &lt;this non-default thing&gt;&quot;. Sometimes chat is enough for that, like when you can ask for a different background color. But sometimes it&#x27;s really not! This is especially true when the things you want are not always obvious from limited observations of the program&#x27;s behavior—where even just finding out that the &quot;good default&quot; isn&#x27;t what you want can be hard.<p>Too few people are working on this latter challenge, IMO.

When I start on a new piece of functionality I describe the problem and give it what my thoughts are on a potential solution and invite feedback. Sometimes my solution is the best. Sometimes the LLM had a better idea and frequently we take a modified version of what one of us suggested. Just as you would with a human partner. The result of the discussion is better than what either of us would have done on their own.<p>I also will do classical ping-pong style tdd with it one we agreed on an approach. I&#x27;ll write a test; llm makes it pass and write the next test which I&#x27;ll make pass and so on.<p>As with a real pair, it&#x27;s important to notice when they are struggling and help them or take over. You can only do this if you stay fully engaged and understand every line. Just like when pairing.

It&#x27;s a bad UI for a lot of use cases. It&#x27;s merely what made sense for UX challenged researchers when they had to come up with a UI for their LLMs in a hurry. Discord was there and reasonably easy to integrate. Many tools started out as just that. Fast forward and most tools are kind of standalone versions of the same thing.<p>The challenge is that I haven&#x27;t seen anything better really.<p>Lately the innovation comes mainly from deeper integration with tools. Standalone AI editors are mainly popular with people who use relatively simple editors (like VS Code). VS Code has a few party tricks but for me swapping out Intellij for something else on a typical Kotlin project is a complete non starter. Not going to happen.  I&#x27;d gain AI, but I&#x27;d loose everything else that I use all the time. That would be a real productivity killer. I want to keep all the smart tooling I already have and have used for years.<p>There are a few extensions for intellij but they are pretty much all variations of a sidebar with a chat and autocomplete. Autocomplete competes with normal autocomplete, which I use all the time. And the clippy style &quot;it looks like you are writing a letter&quot; style completions just aren&#x27;t that useful too me at all. They are just noise and break my flow. And they drown out the completions I use and need all the time. And sidebars just take up space and copying code from there back to your editor is a bit awkward as UX<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been using chat gpt. It started out pretty dumb but these days I can option+shift+1 in a chat and have it look over my shoulder at my current editor. &quot;how do I do that?&quot; translates into a full context with my current editing window, cursor &amp; selected text, etc. all in the context. Before I was copy pasting everything and the kitchen sync to chat gpt, now it just tells me what I need to do. The next step up from this is that it starts driving the tools itself. They already have a beta for this. This deeper integration is what is needed.<p>A big challenge is that most of these tools are driven to minimize cost and context size. Tokens cost money. So chat GPT only looks at my active editor and not at the 15 other files I have open. It could. But it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also unaware of my project structure, or the fact that most of my projects are kotlin multiplatform and can&#x27;t use JVM dependencies. So, in that sense, every chat still is a bit ground hog day. It&#x27;s promise to &quot;remember&quot; stuff when you ask it too is super flaky. It forgets most things it&#x27;s supposed to remember pretty quickly.<p>These are solvable problems of course.

I&#x27;ll write out more but just for you I&#x27;ll summarize what I&#x27;m gonna end up writing up.<p>AI models fundamentally work on the basis of &quot;given what&#x27;s before, what comes next?&quot; When you pass messages to an API like:<p><pre><code>    [
      { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, content&quot;: &quot;You are an expert in selling propane and propane accessories. Whenever someone talks about anything that isn&#x27;t propane, steer them back.&quot; },
      { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What should I use to cook food on my grill?&quot; },
      { &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;For cooking food on your grill, using propane is a great choice due to its convenience and efficiency. [...]&quot; }
    ]
</code></pre>
Under the hood, the model actually sees something like this (using the formatting that DeepSeek&#x27;s Qwen 2.5 32b reasoning distillation uses):<p><pre><code>    You are an expert in selling propane and propane accessories. Whenever someone talks about anything that isn&#x27;t propane, steer them back.
    &lt;｜User｜&gt;What should I use to cook food on my grill?&lt;｜endofsentence｜&gt;
    &lt;｜Assistant｜&gt;
</code></pre>
And then the model starts generating tokens to get you a reply. What the model returns is something like:<p><pre><code>    For cooking food on your grill, using propane is a great choice due to its convenience and efficiency. [...]&lt;｜endofsentence｜&gt;
</code></pre>
The runtime around the model then appends that as the final &quot;assistant&quot; message and sends it back to the user so there&#x27;s a façade of communication.<p>What I&#x27;m doing here is manually assembling the context window such that I can take advantage of that and then induce the model that it needs to think more, so the basic context window looks like:<p><pre><code>    Follow this JSON schema: [omitted for brevity]
    &lt;｜User｜&gt;Tell me about Canada.&lt;｜endofsentence｜&gt;
    &lt;｜Assistant｜&gt;&lt;think&gt;Okay
</code></pre>
And then the model will output reasoning steps until it sends a &lt;&#x2F;think&gt; token, which can be used to tell the runtime that it&#x27;s done thinking and to treat any tokens after that as the normal chat response. However, sometimes the model stops thinking too soon, so what you can do is intercept this &lt;&#x2F;think&gt; token and then append a newline and the word &quot;Wait&quot; to the context window. Then when you send it back to the model, it will second-guess and double-check its work.<p>The paper s1: Simple test-time scaling (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2501.19393" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2501.19393</a>) concludes that this is probably how OpenAI implemented the &quot;reasoning effort&quot; slider for their o1 API. My index.js file applies this principle and has DeepSeek&#x27;s Qwen 2.5 32b reasoning distillation think for three rounds of effort and then output some detailed information about Canada.<p>In my opinion, this is the kind of thing that people need to be more aware of, and the kind of stuff that I use in my own research for finding ways to make AI models benefit humanity instead of replacing human labor.</div><br/><div id="42936353" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42936353" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">disqard</span><span>|</span><a href="#42935333">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935594">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#42944355">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42936353">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42936353">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank You so much for making time to write that up!

If the misinterpretation happens often, you can add on another instruction on top of that. I <i>strongly</i> disagree that they&#x27;d be fixed documents. Documents are a way to talk to yourself and get your rules right before you commit to them. But it costs almost nothing to do this with AI vs setting up brainstorming sessions with another human.<p>However, the rational models (o1, r1 and such) are good at iterating with themselves, and work better when you give them documents and have them figure out the best way to implement something.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42937223" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42937223" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bangaladore</span><span>|</span><a href="#42940899">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42937937">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42937223">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42937223">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I also dislike using chat as a pattern for AI tools. However, in theory, the idea has merit. Just as having 100% of the specifications and design guidance for a product is valuable before development, complete requirements would seem ideal. In reality, though, many requirements and specifications are living documents. Should we expect to rebuild the entire application every time a document changes? For example, if I decide to reduce a header&#x27;s height, there&#x27;s a significant chance the application could end up looking or feeling entirely different.<p>In a real-world scenario, we begin with detailed specifications and requirements, develop a product, and then iterate on it. Chat-based interactions might be better suited to this iterative phase. Although I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the approach, it does resemble receiving a coworker&#x27;s feedback, making a small, targeted change, and then getting feedback again.<p>Even if the system were designed to focus solely on the differences in the requirements—thus making the build process more iterative—we still encounter an issue: it tends to devolve into a chat format. You might have a set of well-crafted requirements, only for the final instruction to be, &quot;The header should be 2px smaller.&quot;<p>Nonetheless, using AI in an iterative process (focusing on requirement diffs, for example) is an intriguing concept that I believe warrants further exploration.</div><br/></div></div><div id="42937937" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-42937937" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Bjorkbat</span><span>|</span><a href="#42937223">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#42935193">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-42937937">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-42937937">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This kind of reminds me of back when the hype cycle was focused on Messenger apps and the idea of most online behavior being replaced with a chatbot.

Basically, a contract is an agreement to define a system with a series of states and a response for each state defined, and the vast and difficult-to-navigate body of contract law is proof that even when purposefully being as unambiguous as possible with two entities that fully grasp the intricacies of the language being used there is so much ambiguity that there has to be an entire separate group of people (the civil court system) whose only job it is to mediate and interpret that ambiguity.

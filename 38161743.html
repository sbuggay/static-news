I think both of those camps conflicting is really what made it really painful - breaking changes were held for years and then once one got in they all came. I think the reality is that coming up with a migration plan incrementally working towards it would give developers more time to focus on one upgrade rather than a full rewrite. Node gets a bad reputation for being &quot;chaotic&quot; or &quot;constantly changing&quot; but the changes are small and manageable comparatively.

There isn&#x27;t much excuse for the rest, as forks with miniscule development resources managed to backport everything else. 3 did turn out a generally nicer language than 2, even if it was slower and caused a solid decade of pain.</div><br/><div id="38173211" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38173211" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">o11c</span><span>|</span><a href="#38172088">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38172764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38174097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38173211">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38173211">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Except that python2&#x27;s `unicode` was a mistake. We already knew at the time that &quot;just use utf-8 for everything, and never use numerical indexing&quot; was the way to go, but instead python3 decide to leave us with <i>no</i> working string class, as opposed to python2 which at least had a mostly-working one.<p>That said, the major forces against the transition were that it was <i>impossible</i> to write code that worked with both versions for a long time:<p>* python 2.7 added support for a few python3 syntax&#x2F;library features, but python 2.6 was very widely deployed on stable distros.<p>* it wasn&#x27;t until python 3.3 (very late to actually be deployed) that you could even write a <i>unicode string literal</i> (you know, the thing the claimed the transition was all about) that still worked in python3<p>* python before 3.3 had a completely bogus idea of &quot;unicode&quot; on Windows anyway, even ignoring the API nonsense.<p>* python 3 completely <i>broke</i> the way indexing worked for `bytes`, making it produce <i>integers</i> (rather than single-codeunit instances) of all things.<p>* there was a lot of gratuitous package breakage. Instead of leaving deprecated shim packages, they just removed them, and you hard to add a <i>third-party</i> dependency to get something that worked with both versions (and said dependency hooked into core parts of the interpreter in weird ways).<p>It wasn&#x27;t until around 3.5 that there started being <i>any</i> actual advantage of python3 at all. But there is still tons of code that is no longer possible to write.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38174097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38174097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hoseja</span><span>|</span><a href="#38172088">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38172527">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38172566">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38174160">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38174097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38174097">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Python is made for cobbling together things with string and ducktape, for users who would do such a thing.
